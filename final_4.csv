US,84.0,60.0,Paso Robles,Clos SolÃ¨ne,"This is a simple, slightly sweet wine. It tastes like a pineapple, lime and vanilla pastry melted down into wine, with alcohol giving heat, and acidity to make it crisp."
Argentina,89.0,10.0,Mendoza,Alma del Sur,"Clean and full for starters, with big berry aromas and hints of freshly poured tar as well as minerality. The palate is pure and hits the nail on the head in terms of feel. Flavors of blackberry and plum are dark and generous. Finishes with pepper, espresso and chocolate. Very good wine for the price."
US,88.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Alma Rosa,"The acidity on this fine wine makes your mouth water, giving a clean bite to the pineapple, orange, sweet cream, honeysuckle and cinnamon-spice flavors. The balance of tartness and sweetness is what makes the wine so appealing."
US,87.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,Barrage Cellars,"Pure Merlot from the Red Willow vineyard, this does not skimp on the scents and flavors of green herb. It's true to the vineyard's style and will require further bottle age to flesh out a bit and show its best strengths."
US,88.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Curtis,"This fun, delicious wine tastes generous in honey, pear, Meyer lemon, orange, nectarine and white flower flavors, which are balanced by zesty acids. The blend is Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier."
US,87.0,55.0,Carneros,Laird,"Simple and earthy, this ranch-designate shows a wealth of brick color and flavors of cherry cola, raspberry and bay, its full-bodied ripeness offset moderately by acidity."
US,96.0,82.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"A vineyard for both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, Allen is exquisitely detailed in this textured bottling that's weighty, with a tannin backdrop and replete with savory fruit. Wild strawberry, Bing cherry and black tea stand out, with an undercurrent of lushness that's hard to resist."
Argentina,87.0,35.0,La Consulta,Altocedro,"Smoke and burnt rubber are prominent aromas. This PV feels grabby and pushy, with hard tannins. Creamy candied-berry flavors are sweet and chocolaty, while this tastes of oak, caramel and vanilla on the finish."
US,87.0,23.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lafond,"A robust Syrah, simple and direct, but loaded with flavor, with classic tannins and fine coastal acidity. It's power-packed with blackberries, currants, leather and loads of savory baking spices. Drink now."
France,92.0,65.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Vray Croix de Gay,"An interesting percentage of Cabernet Franc gives this wine a more perfumed character than is usual in many Pomerols. On the palate, the wine is rich and shows the aromatic character of the berry fruits and well integrated wood. It is young still, needing time. Drink from 2017."
France,92.0,22.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Couhins,"This is a bright wine?still a little closed but promising fine fruitiness for the future. With herbal acidity, lemon and grapefruit flavors and a zesty tang at the end, it will develop relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
Argentina,87.0,9.0,Mendoza,Espiritu de Argentina,"A far better wine than the previous vintage. This is big, beefy and clean, with bacon on the nose. The palate is perky, zesty and high in acidity, and thus the flavors of cherry and plum are forward and alert. Finishes with snap and pop as it begs for pizza, grilled chicken or a hamburger off the grill."
US,93.0,62.0,Napa Valley,Ramey,"Sites from throughout the valley contribute to the lovely layering of this accessible wine, softly structured and classically inspired in its dried herb and distinct purity of cassis. Delicate despite its ripeness and power, it leaves a smoky hint of sweet tobacco on the finish."
US,92.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"This is a delightful wine, crowd pleasing and complex. It benefits from its lack of oak by focusing on its lifted fruit?a twist of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit?its acidity nicely measured and not one-dimensional. The crisp freshness is complemented by a hint of white rock and subtle lushness on the back palate."
Italy,89.0,36.0,Barolo,Giribaldi,"Forest floor, exotic spice, new leather and a balsamic note of menthol lead the nose. The palate is still youthfully shy and extremely tight, but it eventually reveals suggestions of raw cherry, tart cranberry, espresso and dark spice. Close-grained tannins give the finish a firm squeeze."
US,90.0,17.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Savage Grace,"An immediately appealing wine with notes of freshly cut apple, apricot, mineral and jasmine. Though it has 17 g/L residual sugar, it drinks barely off dry with the vineyard's electric acidity more than balancing out the midpalate's sugar, providing a dry feel to the drawn-out finish. Equal parts phenolic feel and flavor, put it on the dinner table now to see it at its best."
US,90.0,24.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Helwig,"This exuberant wine has sunny pineapple and banana flavors and a rich, almost sweet feeling in the mouth. It's light in color, tropical in aroma and light bodied, with good crispness and a lingering finish."
US,88.0,40.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Easton,"Touches of earth, new leather and sweet vermouth fill the aromas and flavors of this edgy but very enjoyable wine. It has a seeming-sweet blend of maraschino cherries, baking spices and spicy, barnyard accents."
France,89.0,15.0,Saumur,Bouvet-Ladubay,"A tight wine with notes of almond and green fruit that add tension to the structure. The acidity is dominant in this complex, textured wine. It could age beautifully over the next 2?? years."
France,90.0,27.0,Alsace,Leon Beyer,"Green and yellow pear notes play on nose and palate. The rounded palate shows some definition, with an enlivening vein of freshness. This wine is easy and dry, with a clean and lasting finish."
US,93.0,130.0,Napa-Sonoma,Pride Mountain,"Few Bordeaux-style wines in California are as ripe and bold as this, but that's the Pride style. The wine explodes in spicy blackberry, currant and cherry fruit, almost like punch, while oak adds toasty notes. A heady wine, it's also brutally firm in tannins. It's a little warm in alcohol, but that shouldn't keep it from aging for at least eight years?and maybe longer."
Italy,92.0,86.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Corte dei Venti,"Spicy and full-bodied, this opens with aromas that suggest sunbaked earth, leafy underbrush, baking spice and a whiff of leather. The smooth, chewy palate doles out ripe Morello cherry, fig, cinnamon, tobacco and star anise alongside solid, velvety tannins. It's already surprisingly approachable and offers fine near- and mid-term enjoyment. Drink 2017??025."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Accordini Igino,"This has intense fragrances of moist earth, blackberry, raisin and almond. The rich palate offers concentrated black cherry, plum, cinnamon and black pepper flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage and while it doesn't seem to have enough fresh acidity for long-term aging, it's velvety-smooth and delicious now."
US,87.0,19.0,Dry Creek Valley,Dry Creek Vineyard,"Dry and a little bitter in tannins, with flavors of cherries, cranberries and herbs. It's elegantly constructed and feels silky and balanced in the mouth. A very nice and versatile food wine that will take a few years of cellaring."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Barolo,Tenuta Duecorti,"Aromas of espresso, vanilla, French oak and mature plum come together in the glass. The warm palate delivers juicy black cherry, mocha and anisette alongside fine-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink 2018??025."
US,81.0,14.0,California,Apothic,"Made from Zinfandel, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine has simple flavors of pink bubblegum and white sugar."
US,88.0,12.0,Oregon,A to Z,"The current downturn in demand for both grapes and expensive wines only helps A to Z; there is more good fruit to purchase, and plenty of demand at a $12 price point. This new Pinot Gris is fresh and racy, with a mineral-driven acidity underlying the clean fruit, tasting of pears and pear skin."
Italy,87.0,54.0,Barolo,Rizieri,"Aromas of espresso, sawdust, high-toned fruit and a whiff of vanilla lead the nose. On the palate, notes of chocolate and coconut accent plum, black cherry and cocoa while polished tannins offer support."
US,90.0,32.0,Alexander Valley,Gia Domella,"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish. The tannins are quite strong now, giving the wine a chewy toughness and suggesting moderate aging. Hold until after 2008."
Italy,89.0,18.0,Soave Classico,Cantina del Castello,"This opens with subtle aromas suggesting wild flower and orchard fruit. Round and ripe, the palate shows tropical fruit, pineapple and citrus peel alongside a saline note."
US,86.0,54.0,Sonoma Coast,Pali,"Made in a drink-me-now style, this is a delicately balanced wine, rich in oak, with a wealth of raspberries and cherries. It's soft, delicious and a little high in alcohol."
France,84.0,10.0,Bordeaux,Baron Philippe de Rothschild,"This is a toasty, black-currant-fruited wine. Its structural tannins give a dry character. A touch of green herb and a hard edge of toast indicate that the wine needs another year to soften."
Spain,89.0,15.0,RÃ­as Baixas,RamÃ³n Bilbao,"Apple and melon aromas are clean, stony and direct. This feels juicy while also offering ample body weight. Tangerine and nectarine flavors finish long, minerally and ripe, with none of AlbariÃ±o's common pithy bitterness."
US,89.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Kissos,"A pretty, polished Cabernet, rich and spicy in jammy black raspberry and cherry fruit. Ripe, smooth Napa tannins give it an upscale mouthfeel. Seems best over the next 2?? years."
US,94.0,110.0,Napa Valley,Tetra,"Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate."
US,91.0,24.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Los Portales,"This is a generous, mouth-filling and deftly complex wine that's also deep and concentrated. It seems to blend the meaty character of MourvÃ¨dre, also known as Monastrell, with more fruity and spicy nuances."
US,86.0,12.0,California,Michael Sullberg,"This traditionally-styled wine has nice olive and herb aromas and smoky, dark cherry and bell pepper flavors. It's light-bodied, smooth and easy to sip."
US,87.0,14.0,California,Francis Ford Coppola,"Lots to like in this smooth, polished Chardonnay. It shows plenty of ripe pineapple, peach and pear flavors, with overtones of vanilla and buttered toast. Good price for the quality."
US,88.0,16.0,Elkton Oregon,Brandborg,"Aromatically intriguing, this features notes of crushed green grapes, green apple and botrytis. It's a hair off dry, with nicely balanced acidity and stone fruit flavors. Best as a dinner table companion."
US,93.0,48.0,Paso Robles,Parrish Family,"This eye-opening blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Petite Sirah is dark and sexy in color, showing aromas of black cherry, sarsaparilla and black tobacco on a densely complex nose. It is soft and lush on the palate, with caramelized blueberry and black-cherry flavors, boosted by a touch of smoked meat."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Vibrant and structured, this expression of Aglianico opens with a fragrance that recalls blue flower, dark woodland berries, forest floor and balsamic notes. The polished palate offers red cherry, black pepper, licorice and menthol alongside subtle oak. It's well balanced but still young, with nervous acidity and assertive tannins. Drink after 2018."
US,93.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Avennia,"Sestina is the bigger sister to the winery's Gravura; again Cabernet Sauvignon takes front and center, with Merlot (18%) and Cabernet Franc (9%) filling in the rest. 70% of the French oak used was new, and the wine has more toast, smoke and barrel depth than its companion, though less of the luscious red fruit is showing. Espresso, cacao and other dark, roasted flavors wrap around black cherry cola and milk chocolate; the finish thoroughly delicious."
France,86.0,20.0,CrÃ©mant de Loire,Ackerman,"Fresh and crisp with sliced apple fruits, this is a light lively wine. It is dry although there is a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear flavor. Ready to drink, it is fruity and refreshing."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Monsanto,"In this vintage, Monsanto's flagship wine, made from 90% Sangiovese Grosso, is a prime example of traditional Chianti. It features racy, dry cherry fruit, hard edges and structure galore. Whether it will evolve into a more open and friendly wine remains to be seen; normally Il Poggio ages well and improves in the bottle."
US,91.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Kontos,"This is an unusual blend of Viognier, Chardonnay, Roussanne and Orange Muscat?quite different from previous vintages. Crisp and penetrating, it's a mix of lime, melon and kiwi flavors that are etched with skin phenolics, putting some delicious bite into the finish."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio,Cantine Olivella,"This blend of native grapes (80% Caprettone and 20% Catalanesca) conveys delicate fragrances of Spanish broom and white fragrant flowers. The vibrant palate offers apple, citrus and peach accented with notes of Mediterranean herbs. Vinity Wine, Panebianco."
Spain,90.0,30.0,Priorat,Marco Abella,"Ripe but nuanced aromas of tobacco, fig, berry and cassis come in front of a crisp, lively, fresh palate. Flavors of reedy berry, herbs, minerally plum and red currant finish with herbal tomato hints, dry tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2018."
France,88.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Pas du Cerf,"Crisp and fruity, this wine demands to be drunk this summer. With bright red fruits, a light smoky texture and lime zest flavor, it is light, fresh and fragrant at the end."
US,90.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Falcone,"There are lots of lush flavors in this soft, mellow Syrah. It shows ripe blackberry jam, bacon, anise, cocoa and pepper notes, wrapped into smooth, complex tannins. Ready to drink now."
Spain,93.0,149.0,Ribera del Duero,Arzuaga,"For aged Ribera del Duero, this is right on target. An elegant, lightly leafy nose with lemony oak and tobacco notes along with dried berry and plum aromas is spot on and classy. The palate feels plump and honest, with moderate tannins. Flavors of earthy plum and berry, tobacco and a pantry's worth of spice finish full and chunky. Drink through 2022."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Barbera d'Alba,Marcarini,"This is a wine for anyone who longs for an old fashioned Barbara. An interesting, funky  and very complex nose of menthol, wet fur, coffee, and strawberries. On the palate, it seemed surprisingly soft (one would have expected more acidity) and the flavors less funky than the nose, with a core of sweet strawberry fruit at the finish."
US,87.0,26.0,Sonoma Valley,Sebastiani,"Aromatically alive with the smell of anise and salumi, this is a soft, layered expression of the grape. Blended with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Zinfandel and Syrah, it's expressive in blackberry and blueberry fruit."
US,92.0,100.0,Rutherford,Mathew Bruno,"Soft and supple on the palate, this impressive wine is lightly spiced with dust and clove, its tannins rounded and in support of lingering cassis and red cherry flavors. Mocha and tobacco lend additional depth and complexity as it unfolds, punctuated by juicy acidity."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Alto Adige,Castel Sallegg,"Subdued aromas of yellow stone fruit and a whiff of cut grass lead the nose. The linear, rather slender palate shows grapefruit, tomato leaf and lime alongside brisk acidity."
US,93.0,36.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Cent'Anni,"Kudos to winemaker Doug Margerum for holding onto this extremely pleasing wine long enough for all the components to come together. Six years in, the aromas of cola, black cherry, rose petal, pepper dust and crushed gravel are still fresh and vibrant, while the palate remains upright due to structural tannins. Flavors of blackberry, raspberry and baking spice abound, making for an elegant wine."
France,84.0,20.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Le Bourdieu,"An obviously wood-aged wine, this shows a bitter toast character. The fruit is lean, struggling to show through the dark chocolate flavor. It has an austere finish, which is mitigated by its final acidity."
Italy,86.0,27.0,Montecucco,Collemassari,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subdued aromas suggesting espresso and toast. The palate is rather lean in terms of fruit richness, offering red currant, clove and a hint of vanilla alongside close-grained tannins that lead to a mouth-puckering close."
US,94.0,78.0,Russian River Valley,Rochioli,"Succulent and complex, this wine offers substantial body and lush plushness on the palate, alluring in its layering of cardamom spice and orange, cranberry and cherry. Satisfyingly ripe, with inimitable balance, it shows the elegance possible in spite of the appellation's power."
US,85.0,15.0,California,Zin 91,"Here's a sound, drily tannic Zinfandel to drink with roasted meats and hearty stews. It's dry and spicy, with blackberry, currant, herb and coffee flavors that finish with a hint of raisins. Ready now."
US,88.0,35.0,Carneros,Truchard,"A good Cabernet, dry and classic in black cherry, currant, plum jam and cedar flavors. It's a little irregular in the mouth, with cutting acidity, and its future is uncertain. Give it a long decant."
US,97.0,130.0,Napa Valley,Caymus,"So delicious now, you can hardly keep your hands off it. Blackberry tart, ripe blueberry, cassis, milk chocolate, licorice and sweet, smoky cedar flavors flood the mouth, dramatically huge and memorable, and lasting long into the finish. The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth. Shows the class and potency this bottling has exhibited for many years, and believe it or not, the price is a relative bargain these days. Drink now??020."
US,88.0,45.0,Red Mountain,Auclair,"Barrel influences takes over aromatically, with notes of wood, toast and dark chocolate in front of golden raisins, with the fruit seeming somewhat dried out. The palate brings tart cranberry and cherry flavors that show a sense of liveliness. Good things are going on but the aromas and palate seem a bit disconnected at present."
US,88.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Patterson,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (46%), Cabernet Franc (24%), Merlot (22%) and Malbec. Aromas of dark fruit and spice are followed by cherry and black-fruit flavors, backed by lightly grainy tannins."
US,92.0,40.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Ridge,"A fancy, rich Chardonnay that has concentrated, intense Meyer-lemon tart, mineral and honeysuckle flavors, yet it's elegant, with streamlined acidity. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast. This showcases the opulence of Chardonnay, while maintaining balance and dryness."
US,93.0,37.0,Sonoma Mountain,La Follette,"Flavors of cherry compote, Dr. Pepper, vanilla, exotic spice and sandalwood are brightened by acidity, making this easy to mistake for a Pinot Noir. This is rich, vital and complex, so pair it with fare like roast duck or lamb. Greg La Follette has taken the lead in California in exploring the Meunier possibilities, with brilliant results. Drink now??017."
US,91.0,86.0,Napa Valley,Snowden,"This full-bodied, voluptuous wine is spicy in red fruit and floral aromas that lend it a finessed, elegant air. Soft and round, with structure and acidity, it ends in bittersweet chocolate and clove. Drink now through 2023."
US,94.0,58.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ch.igai Takaha,"This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose. The palate is complex and fascinating, with chalk and cement minerality bolstered by lime blossom, kumquat and tonic that opens graciously with time. Drink 2016??026."
France,89.0,40.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau de Lescours,"The wine shows the firm tannins of the vintage. They give a dry core that will probably remain. However, there is also a fine layer of fresh black-currant fruit that gives a fine lift to the wine at the end. It will be ready soon, drink from 2017."
US,93.0,40.0,Santa Maria Valley,Peake Ranch,"This is the first white bottling from a new project by John Wagner, co-owner of John Sebastiano and Sierra Madre vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Flint, dried limes, chives and a touch of smoked chicken show on the fresh nose. Light and clean on the sip, it's distinctive with flavors of buttered lemon slices, smoke and sweet onions."
US,90.0,38.0,Sonoma Valley,B.R. Cohn,"This Zinfandel is high in alcohol, soft and alluring. It takes Zin's briary, brambly personality and whips it into Cabernet-like balance. There are varietally correct berry-cherry flavors, containing a touch of raisins, chocolate and lots of exotic spices."
US,87.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Rancho Sisquoc,"This is arguably the winery's best Merlot ever. While it is not an ager, it is a lovely food wine that's dry, with crisp acidity. It expresses subtle flavors of cherry, red currant, tobacco and sandalwood flavors."
US,92.0,42.0,Anderson Valley,Theopolis,"This intriguing and multifaceted wine is a great discovery. Beautifully made in a slightly rustic style, it offers abundant forest floor and clove aromas while dealing out black tea, rhubarb and tart cherry on the palate. Drink from 2018 for the most enjoyment."
US,91.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Boheme,"Briny like lime salt, this coastal wine is lovely in stony mineral and tart oak. Medium bodied and moderate in acidity, it refreshes in a context of refinement and grace."
US,89.0,60.0,Chehalem Mountains,Carabella,"This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age."
France,86.0,11.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine du Tariquet,"From one of the largest private vineyards in France (2,300 acres), this wine epitomizes the light and fresh style that comes from Gascony in the hidden southwest of France. It is fruity, citrus-crisp with a touch of honey from the Gros Manseng in the blend. Drink now."
US,84.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Calcareous,"Shows all the difficulties of succeeding with this quirky variety in California. The problem isn't ripeness, because this wine brims with cherries and chocolate. Its limitation is structure. Badly needs firmness, elegance, dryness, acidity, lower alcohol."
US,90.0,20.0,Lodi,Covenant,"Aromas like butter, blanched almonds and honey lead to equally rich flavors and a soothing, fat texture for this indulgent wine. It has very good concentration that helps the fruit and nut nuances linger on the finish."
US,89.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Heady floral and spiced peach notes are enticingly aromatic on this well-priced wine. Off-dry in style, it's intensely concentrated on the palate with juicy, sweet stone fruit and lychee flavors. Sprightly lemon acidity drives a long, subtly spiced finish."
Argentina,88.0,20.0,NeuquÃ©n,Alpataco,"Cherry, cough drop, mineral, heat and red licorice on the nose, with medicinal raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and fresh in the mouth, with a rooty finish touched up by vanilla. Flavorful and properly executed, with a slight intrusion of cherry cough medicine."
US,86.0,39.0,Dry Creek Valley,Armida,"Marked by excessive heat from high alcohol, with a jalapeÃ±o pepper burn all the way through. If you can get past that, it's dry and smoothly tannic, with rich berrry, currant, cocoa and spice flavors."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Collio,Primosic,"This opens with subdued oak, dried tropical fruit and bell pepper aromas. On the medium-bodied palate, a confected hint of coconut accents grapefruit and mature peach flavors."
US,87.0,20.0,Alexander Valley,ChÃ¢teau Souverain,"Has the soft, easy but complex tannins that made the appellation famous, and bracing acidity underpinning blackberry, olive and herb flavors. Feels good and rich in the mouth. Try cellaring it for a few years."
US,83.0,10.0,Lake County,Sans Wine Co,"Wet earth, pine needle and floral aromas and assertive menthol and lanolin flavors lend a bold, unorthodox personality to this full-bodied wine-in-a-can."
France,89.0,18.0,Cahors,Clos Troteligotte,"A good value Cahors that shows delicious black fruit flavors and balancing acidity. The tannins are relatively gentle, although there is a dry core. Ready to drink."
US,89.0,35.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Terre Rouge,"A rich, earthy Syrah from a new Terre Rouge vineyard designate, this exhibits well-integrated dark red and blue fruit amidst tobacco and herb highlights."
US,86.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Waterbrook,"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, this Cabernet?which includes healthy doses of Malbec and Syrah?is light in style with notes of herbs and currant. With the oak (21% new American) dialed back, it's fresh and direct."
France,87.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Pourcieux,"This lively, lightly herbal blend includes Cabernet Sauvignon and white Vermentino. It pivots deftly on a texture that is mineral, crisp, and contrasting with the red fruits. It is ready to drink."
Italy,88.0,55.0,Barbaresco,Giuseppe Cortese,"Fruit is harvested from the celebrated RabajÃ¡ cru, a short distance away from the town center of Barbaresco, and presented in a tight, more traditional expression. There's a nervous or sharp quality to the wine that is backed by immediate aromas of chopped herbs, soya sauce and spice."
US,89.0,24.0,Dry Creek Valley,Rancho Zabaco,"This is really a lovely Zin, showcasing how perfectly Dry Creek's terroir works for the variety. Although the alcohol level is high, the wine is elegant and balanced, with polished flavors of wild berries, cocoa, smoky wood and spices."
US,83.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Opolo,"A Southern RhÃ´ne blend of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre, Syrah and Counoise, this red wine is soft, light-bodied and frankly sweet. It has Porty flavors of raisins, currants, chocolate and anise."
US,90.0,30.0,Santa Maria Valley,Brophy Clark,"The husband-and-wife team behind this label deliver a well-balanced, approachable but serious wine in this bottling. Aromas include red rose, dark violet, pomegranate, limestone and clove. On the palate, there is luscious black cherry fruit, with slate and acidity to stand it up straight."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Lugana,Olivini,Aromas of white wild flower and golden apple waft out of the glass while the juicy palate offers Bartlett pear and a hint of nectarine. Fresh acidity gives it a tangy finish.
US,90.0,40.0,Los Carneros,Vine Cliff,"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh."
US,89.0,22.0,Edna Valley,Stephen Ross,"Uplifting, light and fresh peach aromas mix with ruby-red grapefruit spritzer and tiny flashes of honey on this energetic wine by the San Luis Obispo-based producer. The palate shows fresh nectarine, apple blossoms and lots of white flowers, and would make a perfect compliment to spicy food."
Italy,92.0,34.0,Franciacorta,Contadi Castaldi,"Made from Chardonnay grapes, this metodo classico opens with creamy aromas of apricot, honey, citrus and blanched almond. The wine feels smooth, rich and silky on the finish, with small, elegant perlage."
US,89.0,15.0,California,Cupcake,"This full-bodied wine smells like black currants and blackberries, tastes ripe, and is lightly tannic to give it a little grip. Bring on the beef or pork tenderloin."
US,84.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Viansa,"Pretty basic, a dryly tannic red wine with cherry and herb flavors. Feels hard and sharp in the mouth, with astringent tannins and acids. Could age out."
US,88.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Fleming Jenkins,"Front-loaded with ripe, juicy blackberry, cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is a nice wine to drink now. It's flashy and flamboyant, if a bit direct."
US,82.0,28.0,Missouri,Mount Pleasant Winery,"This smells like warm chocolate ganache spread over layers of vanilla buttercream and black plums. It feels loose on the palate, offering soft acidity and only a slight tug of tannin toward the chocolaty finish."
Italy,91.0,32.0,Chianti Classico,Rocca di Castagnoli,"New leather, blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of oak-driven spice lead the nose. The savory chewy palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry, star anise, clove and menthol while lithe tannins provide polished support. Drink through 2019."
France,90.0,30.0,Champagne,LÃ©tÃ©-Vautrain,"This producer releases a vintage Champagne almost every year. This latest release shows the character of a vintage widely regarded as difficult. It's fast maturing, with soft fruit, attractive acidity, just a touch of toast and a mineral structure. Drink now."
US,89.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Pepper Bridge,"Dark raspberry, barrel spice and smoke aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency. Perhaps some time in the bottle will help them settle."
France,86.0,11.0,Vin de France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"A true wine from southwest France, this brings together grapes from Gascony and Gaillac. It is delicate and fruity. The freshest green-fruit flavors come together with intense acidity and a tang that is poised and crisp."
US,89.0,24.0,Finger Lakes,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,"Intensely mineral on the nose with aromas of wet granite and steel, this delicate dry Riesling builds in floral, fruity exuberance on the palate. Fleshy and ripe with white peach and honeydew flavors, it finishes long with hints of zesty lime pith."
US,87.0,14.0,Sonoma County,Kenwood,"Here's a clean, savory Merlot for drinking now at a fair price. It's dry, tannic and smooth in the mouth, with blackberry, blueberry and tobacco flavors, subtlely enhanced with oak."
US,86.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Silver Thread,"Layers of smoke, dark toast and nuts lend a distinctly savory feel. This wine is refreshingly brisk on the palate, marked by delicate touches of pressed apple and pear that linger through the finish."
Australia,87.0,10.0,South Australia,Rocland Estate,"This blend of Petit Verdot (40%), Grenache (29%), Shiraz (29%) and Mataro (2%) ends up being a pleasing recipe at an even more pleasing price. Mulberry, plum and vanilla flavors emerge from the glass, while the mouthfeel is full and lush. Probably best over the next year or so."
France,92.0,27.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Domaine Roche-Audran,"An oak-fermented blend of 90% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this is a full-bodied, richly textured wine for drinking over the near term. Nutty scents and flavors accent grilled peach and pineapple fruit, ending in a long, mouthwatering finish."
France,85.0,12.0,Vin de Pays des CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine de Mirail,"There is a fresh, crisp character to this light rosÃ©. It is eye-watering in its refreshing character, with balancing acidity, smoothing out the edges with a touch of caramel."
US,93.0,60.0,Washington,Quilceda Creek,"Quilceda makes big, muscular Cabernets, but the power is tightly controlled and never out of whack. Firm cherry fruit is edged with mixed spices from barrel aging. Still young and hard, this is a tannic wine that clearly has the stuffing and structure to age indefinitely, but if drunk now will require many hours of breathing time. Editors' Choice."
US,92.0,75.0,Monterey,Talbott,"Zesty blackberry and boysenberry are lifted by white pepper and a touch of thyme on this wine's deep and dark yet fresh nose. Steadily growing acidity frames the palate, where flavors of wet clay and olallieberry paste dominate."
US,82.0,14.0,Mendocino County,Brutocao,"Sauvignon Blanc can vary in style from merely crisp and almost neutral to more herbaceous examples like this. It conveys an assertive, slightly heavy personality with plenty of herb and eucalyptus flavors, a rather soft texture for this variety and dry finish."
US,87.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Trentadue,"Tastes soft and high in alcohol, with flavors of chocolate, cherry pie filling and spice. An appealing wine that's for drinking now."
US,88.0,14.0,Sonoma County,Kenwood,"If there's one thing Kenwood knows how to do, it's making proper varietal wines at a good price. Here's another in a string of fine Zinfandels. For 14 bucks, you get a lovely wine that's dry and balanced, with briary blackberry, pepper, cola and sandalwood flavors."
US,96.0,54.0,Russian River Valley,Arista,"This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards?primarily Ritchie and Banfield. Sugar pie apple and fig flavors form a robustly concentrated fruitiness that's ribbed with vibrant minerality. A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish."
US,88.0,42.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Adamant Cellars,"All varietal coming from Dwelley and Minnick Hills vineyards, this wine leads with aromas of black licorice, dates and green herbs. There's plenty of richness to the flavors, which are backed by a squeeze of grainy tannins."
Italy,90.0,37.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Roccolo Grassi,"A hugely extracted and super rich wine, this Valpolicella Superiore opens with barbecue smoke, spicy salsa, cola, licorice and freshly ground coffee bean. It's bold, rich and long-lasting on the close."
France,91.0,33.0,Sancerre,Domaine BenoÃ®t & Mathieu Fleuriet,"This rich wine is concentrated and full of fruit. That is balanced by the mineral texture that gives the wine its depth and intensity. With a touch of nutmeg and with fruitiness that is still young, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Spain,82.0,12.0,Vino de la Tierra del Bajo AragÃ³n,Bodegas Tempore,"Clunky aromas of raisin and compost lack vitality and suggest overripeness. The mouthfeel is dense and tannic, while flavors of prune and overripe blueberry dominate."
US,87.0,8.0,California,Backhouse,"Lively, lip-smacking fruit flavors and a tangy, tannic texture will make this a great pairing with grilled chicken, steak or portobello mushrooms. Medium bodied and well balanced, it's fun to drink."
US,90.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Black Stallion,"Spicy, with clove and juicy black-cherry flavors, this approachable, densely packed wine is full of fruit and integrated power, yet surprisingly balanced. Soft chocolate and tobacco notes accent the fruit as a long finish wraps up the experience."
France,85.0,17.0,Bourgogne,Mommessin,"A light, perfumed wine with soft tannins and bitter cherry fruits. There is an earthy edge here, and while the wine has brisk acidity, there's an easy texture. It's ready to drink."
France,94.0,90.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Pape ClÃ©ment,"This wine has considerable potential, with rich tannins and firm fruits. It is solid, very dry at this stage although this is balanced by dark plum skin and blackberry flavors. The wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2022. The first harvest at this estate was in 1252. The property is now owned by Bernard Magrez, a wine, art, culture and gastronomy patron."
US,86.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Maddalena,"This wine plays with the herbal, slightly green side of the Bordeaux grape, with oregano, thyme and just-cracked pepper spicing up the soft red strawberry and plum fruit on the nose. Dried herbs show strongly on the palate, alongside elderberry fruit and cedar."
Spain,89.0,26.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Terras Gauda,"Apricot aromas are singular and firmly in control of the bouquet of this Galician blend of 70% AlbariÃ±o, 15% Loureira and 15% CaiÃ±o Blanco. This is juicy and fresh, but low on cushion and leesy framework. Apple and pineapple flavors run quick and finish with minerality and zest."
Italy,90.0,24.0,Friuli Venezia Giulia,Livio Felluga,"There's a slight coppery tinge to this wine's color, which sets it apart from the vast majority of other Grigios on the market. And maybe it's just the suggestion of the hue, but it seems to taste ""pink"" as well, showcasing ripe berries and appples backed by tangy acids and great length. Classy stuff."
US,90.0,39.0,Russian River Valley,Fog Crest,"Pungent earth is met by dark handfuls of baking spice, dried cherry and chocolate in this rich, velvety and full-bodied wine that's smooth and rounded on the palate."
Italy,87.0,67.0,Montecucco,Collemassari,"Hints of menthol and leather lead the nose on this robust red. The hearty, monolithic palate offers dried black cherry, clove and a hint of tobacco alongside firm tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of evident alcohol on the close."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,Sartori,"Made using grapes from the celebrated Montegradella cru, this easy red offers quality fruit aromas of black cherry, cassis and jammy blackberry. On the finish, a spice note and a light shade of tobacco are recognizable."
US,85.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"A little on the sweet side, but nicely crisp in acidity. The flavors offer generous notes of strawberries, orange zest, sugared tea,  vanilla and cinnamon."
US,87.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Ambassador Vineyard,"Vanilla, toffee, wood spice and Band-Aid aromas are out in front of herb are red fruit. The palate is lighter in style, mixing equal part fruit and barrel, finishing tart."
US,88.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Saxon Brown,"This tastes soft and simple now, although considering the vineyard sourcing, that could be misleading. There's a core of raspberry and cherry fruit, with intriguing forest notes of dried pine needles and mushrooms. The acidity is just right, neither bright nor too soft. The wine isn't showing much now, but could be a sleeper. Try after 2015."
Italy,95.0,30.0,Vittoria,COS,"Radiant and earthy, this blend of Frappato and Nero d'Avola boasts enticing scents suggesting dark-skinned berry, leather, sunbaked earth, sea breeze and a floral note. The creamy, succulent palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. A saline note wraps up the finish. Drink 2017??024."
US,86.0,23.0,Monterey County,Rock View,"The texture is silky on this bright, clean Pinot Noir. With strong, ripe raspberry and cherry jam, date, brown sugar and oak flavors, it's also tasty, and ready to drink now."
US,87.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Coeur de Terre,"Made half in stainless steel and half in neutral oak, this comes from 34-year-old vines. It's quite dry, with interesting nuances of sweet grass, clover and green apple. The acids are borderline sour; try this with a bit of prosciutto and a salty cheese."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Il Poggione,"This offers subdued aromas of dark berry, oak, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of violet. The palate shows dried black cherry, star anise and roasted coffee bean alongside firm but fleeting tannins that give it a rather short finish."
US,90.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Fess Parker,"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate."
France,84.0,16.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,La Riviera,"A reminder of Provence's place in the seaside life of France, this is just off dry, a fresh, fruity, simple and very drinkable wine for the summer. With red fruits and a soft texture, it is ready now."
Argentina,92.0,80.0,Agrelo,Lamadrid,"Loamy, rich aromas of blackberry, licorice and chocolate cake come before a bold, balanced palate with acidic kick. Loamy blackberry, prune and licorice flavors finish with jammy richness and lingering flavors of blackberry, chocolate and anise. Drink through 2020."
US,89.0,46.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"A very dark color and ripe, almost raisiny aromas lead to rich, opulent flavors like chocolate-covered cherries and blackberry jam. These saturate a velvety texture of good acidity and firm tannins. While the wine is full of big flavors from ripe or overripe grapes, it has the structure to support them."
US,86.0,32.0,Paso Robles,Adelaida,"This 100% Syrah is rich and ripe in blackberry jam and new oak flavors. It's dry, with a fruity sweetness, and the tannins are strong but yielding. High alcohol gives it a hot feeling. Barbecue is your best bet."
US,88.0,45.0,North Fork of Long Island,Lieb,"Luscious black-cherry and berry notes are accented by notes of cedar, dried mushroom and herb in this elegantly balanced Petit Verdot. Inky and ripe, it's decadently mouth-filling but finishes clean, bolstered by a strike of cranberry acidity."
US,91.0,40.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lafond,"The nose on this wine is delicate at first but then opens up quickly into ripe blackberry, marionberry jam, asphalt and grapeseed oil aromas. It's juicy on the palate, with ripe black cherries and wild berries, but clings to a graphite character in the core as well as a bit of espresso-bean bitterness."
US,90.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Silverpoint Cellars,"Vibrant in apple blossom and coconut, this voluptuous, well-made wine is full bodied and ripe. Key-lime pie and orange pith marry atop a firmly structured texture and a punch of integrated oak, finishing with a taste of caramel apple."
Spain,89.0,19.0,Rioja,ViÃ±a Herminia,"Aromas of graphite, asphalt, floral berry, black cherry and oak are harmonious and inviting. This wine feels juicy and rubbery, while black-fruit and plum flavors come with herbal notes and overt barrel notes. A fresh, juicy, zesty finish is pure Graciano."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Rioja,FernÃ¡ndez GÃ³mez,"Aggressive black-fruit aromas come with earthy, spicy notes that include licorice root. This feels tight, linear and a bit sharp. Flavors of plum, berry, pepper and toast set up a finish that's oaky, spicy and acidic."
US,90.0,23.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Forgeron,"A fine complement to the Forgeron Late Harvest SÃ©millon, this is equally sweet (9.5%) but fortified to just under 18% alcohol. It's reminiscent of Benedictine & Brandy ??orange liqueur with some alcohol power. Nice focus and balance."
US,86.0,19.0,Finger Lakes,Ravines,"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes."
US,84.0,18.0,Sonoma County,Gloria Ferrer,"Sweet pink grapefruit and cherry aromas and flavors abound in this Sonoma pinkster. Fizzy and soft, it tastes slightly sweet and low in acidity. Ends with decent length, and is better for near-term easy drinking. Will be enjoyed by those who don?t enjoy dry, crisp bubblies."
US,93.0,55.0,Rutherford,Bell,"Inky dark, this wine brims with important aromas of cassis, mint and fine, smoky oak. Fully ripe Cabernet blackberry flavors are wrapped in elegant tannins, dry and dusty. The structure is impeccable, the finish long. It's complex but approachable enough for immediate drinking."
US,94.0,48.0,Anderson Valley,Sheldon,"Sheldon's Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir is exquisite. Very light in color (and alcohol level at 12.9 percent), it opens with gorgeous raspberry and violet aromas. Fully satisfying from start to finish, it has a lush mouthfeel, cherry spice high tones and a long, easy finish that will tempt you to want more. This is a beautiful wine. Only 60 cases made."
Italy,89.0,12.0,Salento,Feudi di San Marzano,"This pure expression of Negroamaro has been enhanced by rich oak influence, producing a bouquet redolent of spice, dark chocolate, cigar box and Spanish cedar. There are jammy fruit tones at the back. If oak is not your thing, don't bother."
US,84.0,6.0,California,Sutter Home,"A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood. It's a little soft, and a tad off-dry, but if you need a case of something white to quench the throats of party-goers who aren't real particular, this is the ticket."
France,88.0,17.0,Bourgogne AligotÃ©,Manuel Olivier,"With just that extra touch of concentration from old vines, this is a ripe, full and creamy wine, its acidity rounded out and given extra depth from the rich fruits. It has some weight and density at the end."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Elena Fucci,"Earthy aromas of truffle, damp soil, new leather and black-skinned fruit lead the way while the polished palate shows dried black cherry, prune, clove and ground pepper. Tightly wound, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while notes of tobacco and orange zest linger on the finish."
US,88.0,15.0,Santa Barbara County,Hidden Jewel,"The Nashville-based R.S. Lipman Company, formerly just a Tennessee distributor, comes west for this deal of a wine, with lime blossoms, pink grapefruit and Gala apple slices on the nose. The palate is clean, crisp and rounded with lime spritzer and green-apple flavors."
US,92.0,35.0,Santa Clara Valley,Martin Ranch,"This bottling exhibits all of the classic aromas expected from Nebbiolo: tar, rose, dried cherry, sandalwood and cola. The palate offers much of the same, with dried mulberry and rooibos tea touches. The acidity is strong and the tannins are polished but still very structural. Drink now??023."
US,85.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Castillo De Feliciana,"This youthful rosÃ© spent 16 hours on the skins, then was fermented and aged in stainless steel. It's light and tart, best enjoyed well-chilled on a hot summer day."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Terre Siciliane,Feudo Disisa,"Aromas and flavors of blackberry, wild cherry and accents of licorice and ground pepper all come together in the glass. It's fresh, savory and extremely accessible with round tannins and a soft mouth feel. Drink through 2015."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Alto Adige,Elena Walch,"This full-bodied white leads with typical varietal aromas that recall white roses, lychee and spice. The round, low-acid palate delivers creamy exotic fruit layered with notes of clove and nutmeg. A soft, lingering finish closes on a sweet note punctuated with the warmth of evident alcohol."
US,87.0,15.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry."
US,87.0,54.0,Red Mountain,Archeus,"A blend of fruit from up-and-coming Red Heaven and Scooteney Flats vineyards, this wine brings aromas of game, medicine cabinet and cherry. The fruit flavors are soft in feel, seeming somewhat dried out."
Italy,91.0,70.0,Toscana,Duemani,"A lively and compact Cabernet Franc, with generous cherry aromas and well-integrated oak. Made according to biodynamic principles, it's thick, rich and full of ripe personality. It's a very likeable wine with a pronounced character from a vineyard that was started in 2000. Drink after 2015."
Italy,89.0,36.0,Sant'Antimo,Castello Banfi,"This boasts thick, sun-drenched notes of mature fruit, intense spice and moist earth. The wine's nose is slightly stewy in essence and has some medicinal qualities on the finish. Drink it with pasta and ground beef ragÃ¹."
France,86.0,15.0,Vouvray,Remy-Pannier,"Soft and lightly sweet, this wine is clean and fresh. The white fruit flavors edge towards almond, and there is a refreshing green touch. The aftertaste has currants and sweetness."
US,87.0,16.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Alexandria Nicole,"One would like to see more aromatics, considering the variety, but it remains enjoyable with a lightly spritzy palate with off-dry red-apple and stone-fruit flavors. A straightforward, easy drinker."
US,87.0,13.0,Lodi,Noble Vines,"Not too big, and very tasty, this wine offers a baking-spice aroma leading to almost-sweet red cherry flavors, followed by oaky shadings of vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon that circle back around. It's well balanced by firm tannins and ample acidity that back up the ripe fruit character."
US,88.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Notes of sweet, juicy honey tangerines, stone fruit and muskmelon show on this powerfully fruity, off-dry GewÃ¼rztraminer. It's juicy and forward, but brisk orange-rind notes and citrusy acidity adds balance and structure."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Lugana,Malavasi Daniele,"This opens with pretty aromas of orchard fruit and a tinge of spring blossom. The juicy palate delivers tropical fruit, white peach and citrus alongside bright acidity. A light mineral note marks the close."
US,90.0,35.0,Edna Valley,Edna Valley Vineyard,"Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors."
France,91.0,79.0,Aloxe-Corton,Morey-Blanc,"Rich and dense, revealing ripe fruit, touches of wood and firm flavors, and a delicious juicy interior which bursts through. It revels in this fruit, all red berries and fresh acidity. To finish, there is some toasty wood."
Spain,86.0,20.0,Rioja,Palacios Remondo,"The tough conditions of the 2008 vintage are reflected in this scratchy wine. Plum is the key fruit aroma, and that's followed by a tight, firm body with toasty oak, black fruit flavors, herbal notes and peppery spice. Quick and a touch hot on the finish."
US,91.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,J Vineyards & Winery,"This is a restrained and structured wine, light in tart cranberry, rhubarb and an overwhelming attraction of baked plum. Lush and plush on the palate without ever pushing too far, it lingers in cardamom."
US,94.0,30.0,Sonoma Valley,Carlisle,"An old-vine field blend of GewÃ¼rztraminer, Trousseau Gris and Riesling, this vintage is tiny in production but boldly delicious in flavor and intent. Bright pretty aromatics of honeysuckle meet a balanced layering of creamy white peach, apple and wild vanilla, blessed by supportive acidity."

France,85.0,14.0,Vin de France,Saget la PerriÃ¨re,"From the major Loire producer, this fresh and fruity wine shows the light touch of the region. With red-currant fruit sliced right through with acidity, the wine is lightly textured and ready to drink."
US,92.0,58.0,Anderson Valley,Waits-Mast,"The color is on the light side and the appearance is slightly cloudy but that takes nothing away from the interesting flavors of plum, black tea and mint leaves that come with a mild texture, a light body, some good acidity and a sense of reserve in this native-yeast-fermented wine from a consistently excellent winemaking couple."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Prosecco del Veneto,Domenico de Bertiol,"Here's a very fragrant and floral Prosecco with honeysuckle, chopped kiwi, banana and peach. The wine is fresh and tonic with creamy bubbling and leaves a nice impression overall."
US,88.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (OR),Cathedral Ridge,"Smooth and lightly toasty, this offers plump, palate-pleasing tree fruits and a touch of vanilla custard. Just a tad lighter than the reserve from the same vintage and vineyard."
US,88.0,14.0,California,Apothic,"Beefy, smoky aromas and a soft, sweet blend of blackberry jam and peppery spices make this medium-bodied wine very flavorful. It feels broad and velvety in texture and has enough fruit concentration for a lingering finish."

Spain,91.0,45.0,Montsant,Portal del Montsant,"Aromas of wild herbs, dry brush, rubber, oak and berry fruits come prior to a pointed palate with high acidity and choppy tannins.

Spain,89.0,25.0,Priorat,Nita,"A wiry, minty nose with aromas of herbs, compost and strawberry is pushy and direct. In the mouth, this feels grabby and tight, with driving tannins. Flavors of baked berry, carob and herbs finish with a prune-driven character, heat and choppy tannins."

France,89.0,25.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau ClÃ©ment-Pichon,"Under the same ownership as ChÃ¢teau la Dominique in Saint-Ãmilion, ClÃ©ment-Pichon has produced a richly juicy 2012. Firm structure underlies the generous fruits, while the acidity and the dry core of tannins promise good aging. Drink from 2017."
France,84.0,16.0,Sancerre,Drouet FrÃ¨res,"With a touch of herbaceousness and a rounded texture, this is a simple and fruity wine. Light chalkiness in the texture indicates the only complexity."
Italy,89.0,57.0,Barolo,Barale Fratelli,"The 15-acre Castellero vineyard farmed by Fratelli Barale lies directly northeast of the town of Barolo.

Grapefruit, lime and pineapple flavors burst through, making this highly cellar-worthy wine irresistible already."

US,89.0,26.0,California,Herzog,"Pleasant richness and depth of fruit flavor accompany the deep color and nicely chewy tannins in this full-bodied Cabernet. It tastes dry and well balanced between acidity, tannins and fruitiness, and will be a great mealtime wine with all kinds of protein."
Italy,86.0,18.0,Carignano del Sulcis,Mesa,"Primo Rosso is an easy, informal Carignano-based wine, with sharp aromas of berry, bitter almond and cherry cola. The zesty freshness would pair with baked scamorza cheese."
US,93.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Sequoia Grove,"The winery's grand statement of the year, this blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Cabernet Franc is sourced from several vineyards, including the Tonella site in Rutherford, Stagecoach atop Atlas Peak and Frediani Vineyard in Calistoga. Thick, rich and dusty, it exudes Rutherford's magical dust, followed by chocolate and black licorice, just a trace of fennel on the lengthy finish."
France,90.0,35.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Tracy,"A foursquare wine, all angles and edges, that still needs time to soften and open. It is going to be rich and delicious, hinting at white currants, pears and green plum skins. The minerality and vegetal edge is there as well. An impressive wine from this ancient property."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Romanelli,"Underbrush, forest floor, crushed violet, new leather, mature plum and graphite aromas lead the nose on this brawny red. The hearty palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry, nutmeg, grilled sage and licorice alongside youthfully aggressive but ripe tannins. Drink 2015??025."
Italy,81.0,23.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Selvole,This opens with aromas of oak and roasted coffee bean along with pungent whiffs of farm animals. The palate offers a sour cherry flavor and bitterly astringent tannins.
Italy,92.0,75.0,Franciacorta,Ca' del Bosco,"Creamy and delicious, this offers aromas that recall ripe orchard fruit, bread crust and citrus. The elegant palate doles out mature yellow apple, tangerine zest, pastry and hazelnut, all lifted by a silky perlage that leaves you wanting more."
US,85.0,60.0,North Fork of Long Island,Castello di Borghese,"Whiffs of freshly cut mint and tarragon are pleasant against a backdrop of lean red fruit on the nose and palate of this Bordeaux blend, but lurking traces of underripe fruit and tomato leaf distract."
US,93.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Le Vigne,"This ripe, attractive wine leads with notes of red and black cherries, dried sage, crushed violets and pipe smoke on the fragrant, herbal nose. Once sipped, it's light and lofty for such a dense-smelling wine, with well-spiced cherry flavors and easy-to-enjoy tannins on the palate."
US,90.0,40.0,Santa Barbara County,Margerum,"Vibrant floral aromas of violets, hibiscus and rose hips meet with strawberry extract, licorice paste and a fruit-punch nose. It's easy and light on the palate, with rose petals, lavender and white pepper spicing a rhubarb pie character. Tannins emerge to give density to the finish. It's great for beach or barbecue."
US,90.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Duck Pond,"Fermented in neutral oak barrels, this tasty wine is loaded with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with excellent concentration and length."
US,87.0,16.0,Clarksburg,Clarksburg Wine Company,"A Chenin with 15% Viognier in the mix, this bottling has more depth and fullness than many of Clarksburg's other Chenins. It's creamy yet retains plenty of acidity, it has a tropical fruit imprint and even a touch of grapefruit. It will stand up to all kinds of spicy foods."
Spain,82.0,10.0,Rioja,Darien,"A wide-open, jumbled rosÃ© without much focus or charm. There's peppery heat on the nose and then a lemony, citrusy palate that's at first soda-like and later kind of flat. Has acceptable intentions, but seems to be fading."
US,90.0,42.0,Carneros,Jeff Gordon,"Made in small amounts, this floral, tangy and richly textured white wine offers a depth of honey and caramel that overpowers the prettier, more mineral-driven aspects lurking in the underbelly of body. Youthful, it should come around."
US,89.0,35.0,Livermore Valley,Occasio,"Complex in Middle Eastern and baking spices, Occasio's Petite Sirah is meant to be a tribute to the Livermore Valley's early days of viticultural promise and it delivers in a modern way. With a juicy mouthfeel of red and black fruit, it retains vibrant acidity and finishes long."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Prosecco di Conegliano,Zardetto,"This is a pleasant, no-fuss sparkler with textbook aromas of peach, flowers and citrus fruit. Overall, it lacks intensity but its crisp, lean mouthfeel helps it end on a high, zesty note."
US,91.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Freemark Abbey,"Aged in stainless steel and small barrels of French oak, this wine remains smooth and silky with interweaved acidity, a classic, fresh expression of the variety with very subtle oak. Vanilla and pear find their way onto the finish, providing additional layers of flavor and finesse."
US,90.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Carden,"Blended with 25% Cabernet Franc, this engaging wine has aromas of herbs and blackberries. The fruit shows a real sense of vibrancy and purity, laden with tart, cranberry-like acidity and firm, lightly chalky tannins. Just a baby now, it should be at its peak in 2025."
France,92.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine de la Tour Blanche,Blossom and citrus inform the nose?white jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body. Bright lemon freshness makes the fruit flavors even more vivid. The balance between fruit and freshness gives this tension and makes it very moreish. The finish is clean and orange scented.
Spain,92.0,29.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de Murrieta,"Waxy aromas of dried stone fruits and potent oak open this classy barrel-fermented Viura. A refined palate with cutting acidity energizes woody pear and apple flavors. On the finish, resiny oak and a wave of oxidized Sherry notes are highly complex but maybe not for everyone."
US,84.0,38.0,Cochise County,Pillsbury,"Outspoken, delineated notes of candied lemon and peach meld with a bold aroma of lychee. The attack feels a touch slack, but the acids slowly gain steam across the palate, giving the wine a sense of delayed energy."
Spain,90.0,50.0,Cava,JuvÃ© y Camps,"Bready aromas of baked apple, lees and vanilla convey quality. This feels solid and healthy, with length and depth to the palate. Apple, papaya and honeydew flavors are ripe and smooth, while the finish shows honey and green-herb notes."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Fiano di Avellino,Mastroberardino,"Aromas of candied fruit, toasted oak, vanilla and a balsamic note lead the nose. The palate offers dried apple, dried apricot, almond and a honey note alongside soft acidity. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean. The fruit is already fading so enjoy soon."
US,91.0,56.0,Sonoma Coast,MacRostie,"Earthy in anise and blue fruit, this wine is inexplicably crisp and plush at the same time, showing the allure of the variety in its rose petal aromas. Medium bodied and velvety, it follows through in cassis and pomegranate flavors."
US,85.0,54.0,Napa Valley,Pine Ridge,"Ripe and fruity, this has an oak flavor that overshadows the blackberries and currants."
Italy,87.0,32.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi,Garofoli,"Luminous and fragrant, this is a simple dessert wine made from Verdicchio on Italy's Adriatic coast that delivers apricot, honey, almond paste and touch of dried herb. It has a fresh and tonic feel and adequate density and persistency."
Italy,86.0,78.0,Barbaresco,Dante Rivetti,"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, ripe berry, sage and a whiff of citrus zest. On the palate, white pepper and coconut back up the core of dried cherry alongside astringent tannins, but it lacks fruit richness."
US,86.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Palencia,"Vibrant aromas of pineapple, kiwi and gummy bear lead to just off-dry drinking flavors. The concentration seems a bit lacking."
US,90.0,16.0,Livermore Valley,Concannon,"This is complex, delicious, bold and tannic, bringing the big structure that is expected without being heavy handed. It offers concentrated blackberry and fig aromas, richly jammy flavors that stay dry and a tannic but not tough texture."
US,85.0,14.0,Lake County,Chacewater,"Made from organically grown grapes, this crisp white flirts dangerously with herb and grass tones?what is often called gooseberry?before settling down. It's quite drinkable, if a bit heavy on the finish."
US,91.0,45.0,Yakima Valley,Syncline,"Brooding black raspberry, iron and crushed dried-herb aromas are followed by bright red fruit flavors in this wine. Its purity and texture provide great appeal."
US,92.0,38.0,Carneros,William Harrison,"With a pronounced sensibility of caramelized apple and toasted brioche, this wine opens with a memorable lushness and richness that finds its balance in stony minerality. The highlights of flavor lean into golden pear compote and lemon zest, with a delicate seasoning of ginger."
US,92.0,65.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"This wine comes from a recently planted area of valley, high on a ridge top. A blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 6% Malbec, the aromas boast high-toned notes of mineral, herb, cherry, licorice and dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a sense of concentration and richness. It shows well now, but should only get better with some additional time in the bottle."
US,86.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Graton Ridge,"Soft and simple, with sweet flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, cola and smoky oak. Gets the Pinot job done with admirable silkiness and crispness."
Spain,87.0,20.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Pradorey,"Right away this smells big and waxy, with lightly oxidized, pulpy melon aromas and a hint of seawater. A high-acid medium-bodied palate deals salty flavors of corn and melon, while the finish is fresh, full and a touch pithy in flavor."
US,92.0,28.0,Washington,Waters,"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. It draws you into the glass with high-toned aromas of dried herbs, espresso, red and black fruit, along with floral notes. The palate is poised and polished, showing depth, texture and layering well beyond its weight class. It appeals on every level."
US,86.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Nola,"Aggressive in grass, hay, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors, this wine's dry, slightly vegetal quality is enriched with sweeter notes of lemon sorbet and vanilla. Notable for the acidity, which makes it exceptionally crisp and clean."
US,86.0,19.0,Dundee Hills,Lemelson,"This is certainly dry, as stated, but it doesn't have the texture and stuffing that the best dry Rieslings bring to the show. Simple and straightforward lemon and grapefruit flavors tell the whole story, and those high acids leave a sour impression."
Italy,92.0,58.0,Toscana,Cecchi,"This first vintage of Coevo (a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot) represents a new and dynamic project for Tuscany's historic Cecchi estate. The wine is rich, opulent and redolent of all kinds of dark fruit and spice."
US,93.0,45.0,Edna Valley,Chamisal Vineyards,"Winemaker Fintan du Fresne nails the combination of richness and freshness in this bottling. The nose offers clean lines of wet cement, lemongrass, Gravenstein apple and a slightly exotic spice. Chilled Asian pear flavors kick off the sip, but then comes a buttery, macadamia nut warmth that's hedonistic and delicious."
US,91.0,42.0,Willamette Valley,Big Table Farm,"Lush aromatics conjure up dreams of strawberry cream. This is quite pretty, with perfect balance among its components of fruit, acid and tannin, set comfortably in a compact frame."
France,86.0,20.0,Brouilly,ChÃ¢teau de Corcelles,"In its traditional Beaujolais bottle, like the one-pint pot that was served in local restaurants, this is a soft and fruity wine. It has classic red-cherry fruits and light tannins. The aftertaste is juicy with just a hint of banana."
Italy,90.0,32.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,La Calonica,"This Vino Nobile offers a lighter, fresher interpretation of Sangiovese that would pair with white meat or turkey roast. Aromas include raspberry, white cherry and cinnamon. In the mouth, the wine is tight, linear and direct."
US,83.0,30.0,Monterey,Pianetta,"Way too sweet for a table wine that's supposed to be dry. Almost like a dessert wine, with sugary cherry and raspberry flavors."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Giavi,"Here's a food-fiendly and easy-going Prosecco Superiore (in a dry or Brut expression) that offers aromas of crushed mineral, stone fruit and fresh citrus. This sparkler feels focused and sharp in the mouth."
US,91.0,36.0,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Midnight,"This offers a classic Zin nose, with dried strawberries, plums, white sage, black loam and a minty lift. The palate is juicy but restrained, with ripe olallieberries cut by licorice and tobacco, bound together with considerable grip."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Sterling,"Just lovely to drink now, it's so softly lush and decadently delicious. Beguiles the palate with jammy, pastry flavors of raspberries, cherries and sweet oak. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc."
US,82.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Rancho Zabaco,"Dry and crisp, but too feline in strong green aromas and flavors. A little of that goes a long way. Modest lemon and lime fruit comes to the rescue, but too little, too late."
US,92.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Cordant,"This is not a dainty Grenache, with boysenberry syrup, purple flowers, vanilla, clove cream and Christmas spices redolent on the nose. It's rich on the palate, with blackberry syrup, baked blueberry and vanilla, but also reflective of the variety, with violet, clove, pepper and a touch of asphalt."
France,93.0,40.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Roubine,"The top cuvÃ©e from Roubine, this unusual blend of Tibouren and Clairette is intensely perfumed and ripe and with a fine stylish character. It is an impressive wine with yellow fruits as well as red currant and citrus. This food friendly wine should age a bit, so drink from late 2017."
US,89.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Austin Hope,"As light in color and silky in texture as a Pinot Noir, with refined tannins and a fine burst of acidity. The flavors are characterized by the cherries and raspberries associated with Grenache, along with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, bacon and a floral note. The alcohol is a little too high for comfort or ageability."
US,91.0,55.0,Dundee Hills,De Ponte Cellars,"In 2007 the winery's Estate bottling seems to capture a bit more nuance and detail than the reserve, though admittedly it does not have quite the same concentration. For those who prize finesse, this is the wine of the vintage. Herbal and resiny, it's like sniffing a fine wine in a pine forest. It balances raspberry and sour cherry fruit with the tart and herbal ?wild??side of Oregon Pinot. Penetrating and complex."
US,90.0,64.0,Mendocino Ridge,Arista,"Fruity, spicy, oaky aromas make an instant impression, and tasty, ripe fruit flavors deliver the goods. This full-bodied, lush-textured and quite flavorful wine is bold and dramatic."
France,91.0,50.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Patrice Moreux,"From one of the top vineyard areas in Pouilly FumÃ©, this wine is rich, concentrated and with a great aging potential. Structured and with yellow fruits superimposed over the crisper, citrus flavors, it's still young and tight. Give this impressive wine until 2019 before drinking."
US,84.0,12.0,Monterey County,Kendall-Jackson,"This Riesling is slightly sweet, but it's balanced by crisp acidity. The tangerine, green apple and peach flavors have a honeyed finish."
US,89.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ross Andrew,"Herb and barrel spice aromas are light, with a high-toned berry top note. The black-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry. You want more from the aromas but the flavors quickly compensate."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Chianti Classico,Piccini,"This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner. The more you get to know it in the glass, the more you can identify delicate floral and ethereal aromas that point to a traditional Chianti Classico style. Sharp acidity and bright fruit flavors tell the same story in the mouth."
US,85.0,15.0,Livermore Valley,Rubino Estates Winery,"While light in color, this wine is flavorful and easy to enjoy. Its smoothly textured, medium-bodied palate carries generous red cherry and plum flavors."
US,89.0,47.0,Alexander Valley,Blue Rock,"Soft and herbal but quite delicious, this Cab offers flavors of blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a rich veneer of sandalwood. At its best now and through 2012."
Italy,90.0,41.0,Sicilia,Morgante,"This Nero d'Avola suggests mature black-skinned berry, carob and toast on the nose. Concentrated and chewy on the palate, it offers ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, clove and cocoa flavors framed by velvety, polished tannins. Thanks to its fruit richness, it's not overwhelmed by the warmth of evident alcohol. Enjoy through 2021."
US,93.0,36.0,Seneca Lake,Hermann J. Wiemer,"Sumptuous and hedonistic, this perfumed single-vineyard bottling shines a spotlight on luscious grapefruit, guava and pineapple flavors. It's decadently fruity, but crisp acidity and a delicate crushed-mineral undertone keep it fresh and invigorating."
Italy,89.0,18.0,Nebbiolo d'Alba,Sordo,"Fruity and fragrant, this opens with aromas of red berries, violets and baking spices. Notes of white pepper and clove accent the crushed strawberry and wild cherry flavors that are supported by silky tannins."
US,91.0,28.0,El Dorado,Donkey & Goat,"Be prepared for a murky visual in this unusual, concentrated and complex wine. The appearance is hazy and the color brassy, but the flavors are vivid, fresh and bracing. The mouthfeel has great acidity, an unusually thick texture and fine tannins. A sense of layering and intensity develops with more sips, and lingers on the finish."
US,88.0,19.0,Santa Barbara County,Straight Line,"Here's a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now. It shows how well this variety grows in the warmer parts of the county, with citrus, apricot, peach and spice flavors. Crisp acidity provides zesty balance to this deliciously drinkable young wine."
Spain,90.0,16.0,Somontano,Bodega Otto BestuÃ©,"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Tempranillo opens with spicy berry and plum aromas. It's tight and minerally on the palate, with lightly medicinal cherry and plum flavors that are darkened by a blast of peppercorn. Spice notes and soft oak make the finish friendly. Drink through 2019."
Italy,90.0,23.0,Bolgheri,Le Grascete,"A blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese, this shows an impressive jump forward in terms of its intensity and complexity. This wine is generous, full and round, and it offers flavors of cherry, leather and chocolate."
Italy,86.0,12.0,Moscato d'Asti,Bersano,"Loaded with honey, marzipan, peach and exotic fruit, this special expression of Moscato d'Asti delivers a thick, creamy feel in the mouth with foamy mousse and soapy intensity. Pair this with sugary almond cookies."
US,91.0,200.0,Napa Valley,Diamond Creek,"From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color. The tannins are soft but powerful, eager to age through 2025??027, while the fruit lies on the currant and plum side of things, with a bit of cedar lurking through."
US,85.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Middle Ridge,"Everything about this wine is big. It's superripe in jammy cherries and raspberries, and super-oaky, with a sweet coating of caramelized candy corn. It's a crowd pleaser for many red wine fans, but simply too sweet and simple for the price."
US,81.0,10.0,Missouri,Montelle,"The gorgeously opaque ruby color raises high hopes. However, the undistinguished, earthy nose fails to deliver. The lush palate is a step up, with red berry soup flavors interwoven with an odd ashy note. Long finish. Drink up."
US,91.0,50.0,Anderson Valley,Expression 39,"Big flavors, full body and assertive tannins balance each other to make this out-sized wine a winner. It has ripe black cherry and dried fig aromas, gushing fruit flavors and a broad texture, but the firm tannins keep it from tasting fat. It's hardly delicate, but definitely delicious."
US,94.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Guarachi Family,"From the proprietor's sought-after vineyard site, on the southern side of Sonoma Mountain near Gap's Crown, up to 1,400-feet high, this wine is concentrated in cherry kirsch and orange peel, with a sultry hint of pine. Underlying flirtations with white pepper and cardamom provide further temptation, as the lengthy finish rambles on."
US,90.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,Bodkin,"Juicy peach, pear and honey complement each other in this happy, exuberant expression of the variety that's understated in its elegance. A roundness of body makes it easily complementary to a multitude of spicy foods, itself offering a hit of nutmeg on the finish."
US,90.0,38.0,Chehalem Mountains,Eastburn Vineyards,"This new producer is off to a good start with its first vintage. The fruit is clean and complex, ranging from watermelon to wild strawberry to pie cherry as it washes across the palate. Deep in color, yet light in the mouth, this not only makes you reach for a second glass, it makes you wish the vineyard, planted in 2001, would hurry up and age."
US,92.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Alma Rosa,"Light cherry and pomegranate fruit tones dive into a darker beet-focused nose on this bottling, backed up by touches of crushed asphalt. The flavors are delicate, with a sparse plum-fruit backbone lifted by strong herbal components of tarragon, marjoram, pepper and a bit of juniper."
US,87.0,35.0,Carneros,Robert Mondavi,"This is a dark-colored, dense wine, reeking of aromas fresh from the fermenting tank: juicy blackberry and plum and a strong herbal, earthy streak like mulch and mushrooms. It's well made and clean as a whistle, but currently the profile is austere, although some fruity depth on the finish bodes well for the long haul. Cellar for three years before trying."
US,87.0,30.0,Virginia,Tarara,"Rich, with restrained intensity, this has aromas of toasted graham-cracker crumb, spiced orange marmalade, peach preserves and wilted rose. It feels slightly pudgy on the midpalate, with a tapering finish that ends on a buttered-caramel note."
US,87.0,22.0,Carneros,Benessere,"Just a touch of oak adds a welcome creamy smokiness to this dry, crisply acidic wine. It's superrich in ripe lychee, Mandarin orange, sweet lime and spice flavors. Refreshing and clean, it's a nice cocktail sipper."
US,90.0,36.0,Sonoma Coast,Fulcrum,"Sourced from the Sangiacomo and Gap's Crown vineyards within the Petaluma Gap area of the appellation, this is a tight, tangy wine. Full of citrus, cranberry and dried herb, it finishes savory in sage and forest floor accents. The acidity is subtle and the tannins integrated, making for a well-balanced wine."
US,95.0,30.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Tranche,"The Celilo vineyard has contributed the fruit to many outstanding Chardonnays from a who's who list of winemakers, but none better than this. Intensely concentrated and deeply extracted, it explodes with marvelously pure fruit flavors?the full range of citrus, citrus peel and crisp tree fruits. A wine with perfect virtually balance, exceptional texture and amazing length."
US,89.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Nitty Gritty,"Pricey, but it's a very good Sauvignon Blanc. You can tell right away that it's pedigreed, from the perfumed aroma to the complex flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, sweet hay, vanilla, toast and white pepper. With a dry finish, it's versatile across a range of foods."
France,85.0,18.0,Sancerre,ChÃ¢teau de Thauvenay,"Created in 1819, this vineyard surrounds a Victorian chÃ¢teau overlooking the Loire. This wine is fruity, fresh and soft. It has attractive acidity, a light texture and perfumed acidity set in the context of apple and lime fruits. Drink now."
US,89.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Casa Larga,"Subtle smoke notes accent tangerine, lemon and lime in this invigorating dry Riesling. Fermented via ambient yeast, its refinement and restrained elegance sets it apart from Casa Larga's other Rieslings. The finish is lingering yet fresh."
France,90.0,45.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Au Pied du Mont Chauve,"Brilliantly fresh, this wine is tight with acidity and textured with zingy citrus. Layers of apple and toast are already integrated in this bright wine. It's tangy, lively and likely to be ready to drink from 2017. The wine comes from the highest vineyard in Chassagne."
US,91.0,58.0,Willamette Valley,Rex Hill,"This new designation from Rex Hill is a bit reticent aromatically, but full on the palate, with plummy fruit and a light hint of barnyard. Good texture and nicely threaded flavors roll onto the smooth, lingering finish."
US,95.0,85.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Poet's Leap,"Deep gold, the color of honey, picked at 53Â° brix, this is unbelievably dense and concentrated. Yet with the acidity in place, this wine has balance, support, and depth. It's not a fat, sugary blob. This drinks like a Canadian icewine. Honey, tropical fruits, candied orange, butterscotch, butter and toasted nuts?it just keeps on going."
US,82.0,6.0,California,Leaping Horse,"Tastes harsh and minty, like toothpaste, with some fruit flavors of cherries and blackberries. If you take the price into account, it's not bad."
US,87.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Caymus,"A lovely Cab for drinking now and over the next few years. Shows a classy structure, with rich tannins and ripe fruit flavors of black currants, mocha and cinnamon."
US,85.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Taft Street,"This is a strong, full-bodied rosÃ© with ripe, jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors that finish off dry with fruity essence."
US,94.0,52.0,Carneros,Shafer,"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e."
US,92.0,50.0,Green Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"Decadently rich in caramel and vanilla on the nose, this vineyard-designate evolves into more delicate floral elements, with a depth of spicy oak and baked apple and pear. Throughout the medium body and medium acidity is a freshness of lemon and lime, with a slight twist of tangerine."
Italy,89.0,16.0,Lugana,Zenato,"Aromas of banana, apricot, honeysuckle and tropical fruit lead the nose. The round, medium-bodied palate offers creamy white peach, green apple, tangerine and a hint of honeydew melon. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors."
US,86.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Lagana,"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish."
US,88.0,18.0,Umpqua Valley,Abacela,"Actually a Bordeaux blend, this mainly merlot wine from the Umpqua valley in central Oregon outdoes its peers with dark, plummy, even jammy fruit laced with toast, tar and espresso. Sweet fruit meets stiff tannins, all in the name of structure."
US,88.0,50.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"Sharp in acidity while silky on the palate, this blend of 12 estate blocks is the Pinot made in the largest quantity by the winery. Soft, pretty and approachable, it offers red cherry, blackberry, rose petal and cola spice, with a bite of oak on the finish."
France,85.0,20.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Paul Reitz,"This wine has acidity and a good balance between the fresh, crisp character and the richer yellow fruits. It is ready to drink."
France,87.0,15.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"This is a softly floral wine, with citrus and fresh pear notes that accompany green apple. It is ripe and fruity, with a light tang of orange on the finish. Screwcap."
Australia,88.0,30.0,Barossa Valley,John Duval Wines,"The blend is 71% Marsanne, 20% Viognier and 9% Roussanne. The result is a medium-bodied white that offers straightforward, fruity notes of pear and melon. It's clean and refreshing on the finish, with just a little hint of tannin."
US,87.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Standing Stone,"Exuberant floral notes lend a perfumy touch to fresh apple and pear aromas on this dry, medium-bodied wine. The palate is ripe with concentrated yellow cherry and plum flavors anchored with a puckering line of lime acidity."
US,90.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Antiquum Farm,"This falls sbetween a rosÃ© and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing. Scents of hibiscus tea and rosewater put a delicate top note ahead of rich, ripe, round and spicy citrus fruit. A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish."
US,88.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Balboa,"A rare gem, this SÃ©millon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is sourced entirely from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard. Aged for 10 months in one-year-old French oak, it's a spicy wine with aromatics and flavors of botanicals such as mint and quinine. Fruit is sharp with flavors of grapefruit and white peach, and hints of toast and cracker."
US,94.0,85.0,Dundee Hills,Archery Summit,"Dark and dense upon opening, this compact, concentrated cuvÃ©e matches its muscular fruit to polished tannins. Black cherry dives deep, almost to the level of black currant fruit, and brings a streak of black olive. This impressive effort will drink well now through 2025."
US,86.0,38.0,Sonoma Coast,Red Car,"High in acidity and low in oak, this is a white that pushes the limits, reflective of the extreme, cool-climate vineyards from which it sources. Fresh-squeezed lemon is the star, the wet-stone minerality razor sharp."
US,92.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Avennia,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up nearly equal parts of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Franc (9%). Coming from a who's who of vineyards that includes Bacchus, Red Willow, Klipsun and Boushey, it offers nuanced, supremely well balanced aromas of spice, dried herb, raspberry and blackberry. The palate delivers on all of this promise with succulent yet still reserved red and black fruit flavors that show purity, focus and impeccable balance that kicks it up a notch."
US,91.0,32.0,Carneros,Peace Water,"Yellow apple, pineapple and pear play off streaky minerality in this rich, robust wine, heartily defined by additional layers of lemon chiffon and butterscotch. The density and concentration work in its favor, complemented by a comforting tease of tangerine."
Italy,97.0,97.0,Barolo,Massolino,"Aromas of new leather, ripe dark berry, vineyard dust and a whiff of smoky flint waft out of the glass along with floral and balsamic notes. The full-bodied palate shows great energy and intensity, delivering juicy Marasca cherry, ripe cranberry, white pepper and clove framed in youthfully assertive, refined tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note wraps up the lingering finish. With time, this will develop even greater complexity. Drink 2023??053."
US,85.0,30.0,Virginia,Three Fox,"Nebbiolo has proved to be an enormously difficult grape to grow outside of a few small areas in Northern Italy, but Three Fox Vineyards has done an admirable job. There's pleasant strawberry fruit here with an earthy underpinning of fresh tar. In the mouth, Nebbiolo's trademark grippy tannins proved a backdrop for intense, cherry fruit. Give the tannins a few years to mellow out, then serve with London broil."
US,91.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Ghost Hill,"Stainless-steel fermented and the color of wheat, this still white wine is stylish and compelling. If you've wondered why anyone would bother to make a white Pinot Noir, this is the answer. It's fragrant with sweet grass and melon, then the flavors follow along with grapefruit and kiwi."
Spain,90.0,52.0,Vinos de Madrid,Licinia,"Graham cracker, raisin, earth and leather aromas announce a level of richness. It feels prune-like and saturated but not flat, with blackberry and exotic spice flavors. It qualifies as a lush, ripe specimen with a long finish that stays the course. Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo are the components."
US,94.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Poet's Leap,"Half of this year's Poet's Leap Riesling is sourced from The Benches, one quarter from old-vine plantings at Dionysus, and the rest from Yakima's Phil Church vineyard. Marvelous concentration and a panoply of lush orange, apricot, peach and papaya flavors carry this beautifully balanced wine through a long and satisfying finish. Delicious young, it could also be cellared for a decade or longer."
US,87.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Inception,"A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip."
US,87.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Verve,"A whiff of leather to open, followed by plenty of cranberry and cherry fruit, balanced and medium bodied. Mocha and cola streaks run into ripe tannins."
Italy,84.0,15.0,Terre del Volturno,Vestini Campagnano,"Made with the native grape Asprino, this wine offers mineral sensations alongside racy acidity but it lacks fruit richness."
US,89.0,47.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"High-toned aromas  of cherry and red plum entice on this surprisingly robust Finger Lakes Pinot Noir. Concentrated flavors of cherry and wild strawberry are brambly and tart, with shades of granite that linger elegantly on the palate."
US,85.0,45.0,Calistoga,Summers,"Waxy plum and a surprising characteristic of watermelon provide a subtle freshness to this otherwise hugely tannic, concentrated wine. Tar and yeast play a role as well."
France,86.0,16.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,ChÃ¢teau Beaulieu,"Intensely fruity, this wine is, unusually for a Provence rosÃ©, in need of some time to calm down. Its acidity and red-currant fruits are almost too much at this stage. When it softens out, it will be delicious. Here's your holiday wine for end of 2017."
US,91.0,85.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Serene,"This comes from the oldest estate vineyard, now reaching full maturity. Tart citrus flavors underscore pretty strawberry, drifting into a hint of well-ripened preserves. There's a light touch with the new oak, keeping the wine in perfect balance. Drink now through 2020."
US,88.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Sheldrake Point,"Swirls of smoke and freshly pressed apples entice on the nose of this lean, dry Riesling. On the palate, hints of chalk and wet stone meld with a shower of fresh white grapefruit flavors, finishing long with a bold smoke and honey note."
France,86.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,ChÃ¢teau Saint-Nabor,"This fruit-driven white blend is powered by Roussanee, which showcases its hallmark pineapple fruit. Hints of honey and pear add a bit of nuance, but this easy-drinking, medium- to full-bodied wine remains pretty straightforward."
France,88.0,20.0,Alsace,Cave de Turckheim,"A gentle hint of ripe banana joins rose-petal notes. The palate is full-fruited and generous, setting soft fruit against welcome freshness to create easy-drinking balance. It would make an ideal, well-chilled summer apÃ©ritif."
US,87.0,13.0,Paso Robles,Francis Berwyn,"A lovely Merlot and, at this price, a compelling buy. Hard to find a better inexpensive all-around full-bodied red than this one. Fully dry, it has polished flavors of cherries, currants, anise and pepper, wrapped in a gentle, silky texture."
Spain,90.0,34.0,Montsant,Vinyes DomÃ©nech,"Deep, ripe, pure black fruit aromas feature leather and oak accents. The palate has a nice feel and good balance; it's tight, minerally and deals toasty berry, snappy pomegranate and chocolaty spice. Tight as a drum and long on the finish. Drinkable now but better down the road. 65% Garnacha with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah."
Argentina,90.0,21.0,Mendoza,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Crafted in a New World way, this displays toasty, creamy oak and baked apple aromas. The palate is healthy and bold, while flavors of popcorn, white bread, butter, honeydew and banana maintain freshness and clarity across the finish."
US,96.0,115.0,Fort Ross-Seaview,Wayfarer,"Crafted from estate-grown fruit?a marriage of Pommard and Swan clones?Golden Mean comes from three distinct vineyard blocks, the Pommard fermented whole-cluster. It opens with dark, ripe layers of lush cherry-vanilla, the wine concentrated and rich in oak yet balanced in acidity. On the finish is a mix of leather, licorice and wild herb. Tuck it away through 2020??022."
US,89.0,18.0,Contra Costa County,Three,"Smoky aromas, rich dark-fruit flavors and a plush mouthfeel add up to a powerful, concentrated wine. Made from Syrah, MatarÃ³ (MourvÃ¨dre) and other RhÃ´ne grape varieties, it has a mouthcoating richness, nice depth to the blackberry flavors and a lingering finish."
US,90.0,60.0,Alexander Valley,Archimedes,"A blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon with 6% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, this high-end Coppola offering is like liquid chocolate on the nose.t\Thick and dense on the front of the palate, it settles into a mix of cherry, strawberry and clove."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Larroque,"This is a ripe, rounded and firmly tannic wine. It has weight and a dense texture, with a black plum flavor. With its fruits, sweet tannins and solid structure, it's likely to age well over several years."
US,92.0,24.0,North Fork of Long Island,Osprey's Dominion,"It's rare to see varietal CarmenÃ¨re outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020."
US,90.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Classic lychee and rose petal aromas perfume this ripe yet elegantly composed GewÃ¼rztraminer. Juicy and forward yet balanced and spry, it calibrates zesty tangerine acidity against a crystalline glaze of honey that lingers on the finish."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Gavi,La Zerba,"Linear, fresh and tonic, this easy-drinking Gavi offers a lively mouthfeel accented by acidity and dusty mineral touches. Subdued aromas include white peach and almond blossom."
US,86.0,20.0,Central Coast,Tenshen,"Orange peel and raspberry aromas meet a touch of sourness on the nose of this bottling from Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi, which comes after the label's more successful red and white wines. The palate maintains good acidity and grip, with berry compote and earthy flavors."
US,90.0,14.0,California,Marietta Cellars,"It's great to return to an excellent honest-tasting fruit-driven wine that has very good balance, an appetizing texture thanks to fine-grained tannins and light spicy elements to complement the pure cherry and berry core. It's the kind of wine that doesn't get tiring, and will be ideal to stock up on."
US,87.0,17.0,New York,Suhru,"White blossoms and fresh green herbs perfume this full-bodied wine. Dry in style and refreshingly tart, it finishes briskly with a bit of floral flair."
US,90.0,27.0,Carneros,Starmont,"This wine blends in 13% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a nose of chocolate, barbecue and tobacco. Burly, yet balanced, the highlights include black currant, cherry, clove and plenty of cedar and sage."
US,86.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Collier Falls,"Lots of rich, extracted cherry pie, chocolate and cassis flavors in this soft, oaky Cabernet. It's a little sweet and hot, but will drink well now with grilled steak."
US,92.0,55.0,Spring Mountain District,Spring Mountain Vineyard,"Lots of rich flavors of blackberry, black currant, bacon, pepper and clove in this Syrah, which comes from the winery's big vineyard on Spring Mountain. Feels luxurious in the mouth, with a silky texture and a deep, long finish. It's a bit brusque in tannins, but that's part of its structural distinction. Drink it over the next few years."
US,87.0,16.0,Russian River Valley,Acorn,"A single-vineyard Sangiovese made Chianti-style, meaning it's dry as dust with pronounced acidity. Pretty rich in flavor, though, with a ripe streak of cherries and sweet chocolate. Dry, dusty tannins kick in in the finish."
US,89.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Jaxon Keys,"A great first effort from the new Jaxon Keys winery's estate Sauvignon Blanc vineyard, with green apple, pear, ripe melon and honey prominent throughout the wine's rich, creamy texture, with just a touch of key lime. A great example of inland Mendocino Sauvignon Blanc."
France,93.0,70.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Domaine de Bellene,"This Premier Cru is situated in the southern half of Savigny, close to Beaune proper. Here it has produced a ripe generous wine full of spicy smoky red fruits and balanced acidity. The wine is still showing its baby fruit and needs time. Drink from 2019."
Argentina,91.0,16.0,Mendoza,Ca' de Calle,"Clean, cedary and dynamic, with fine black-fruit aromas on the nose. The palate has a full, layered texture that impresses, while the flavors of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry carry toasty, dark, chocolaty accents. Savory and warm on the finish, with lots of power. A blend of 75% Malbec with 20% Tempranillo and 5% Syrah."
Italy,95.0,80.0,Barolo,Cavallotto,"Dark berry, mint, menthol and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll get on this gorgeous wine. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, refined tannins. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019??026."
US,85.0,32.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Manzoni,"Black pepper, graphite and reluctant boysenberry notes balance the rubbery funk on the nose of this cool-climate Syrah. It's fairly light on the palate, with just-ripe boysenberry and chopped Italian herbs."
Italy,91.0,23.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"This savory Pinot Grigio has a little weight on it thanks to grape selection and 20% aging in large barrels. It delivers classic Granny Smith apple, Bartlett pear, nutmeg and flint in a creamy texture brightened by fresh acidity."
Spain,88.0,45.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors. Overall this is a structured, fairly oaky wine with firm tannins and a toasty finish. Will go well with steak."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Bierzo,Encanto,"Aromas of lemon, green apple and wet stone make up the nose on this quaffable Godello that's solid on the palate, with some pithiness. Flavors of melon, apple and green banana finish with notes of lees, citrus pith and bitterness."
Italy,92.0,25.0,Carignano del Sulcis,Mesa,"Scents of perfumed berry, eucalyptus, chopped herb and a whiff of leather unfold in the glass. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground black pepper and anise alongside polished, velvety tannins."
France,94.0,145.0,Volnay,Domaine Henri Delagrange,"Vines planted in 1939 by the current winemaker's grandfather give an impressively ripe wine. It is dense with concentrated tannins, smoky red fruits and still youthful acidity. The wine has a bold juicy character that comes from the open-tank fermentation giving great fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2020."
US,89.0,50.0,North Fork of Long Island,Bedell,"Luscious blackberry and cherry flavors take center stage here, showing just a glaze of nuttiness and roundness from judicious oak aging. Tart cranberry acidity and fine but slightly puckering tannins frame the palate squarely."
US,92.0,45.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Andrew Will,"100% varietal, this wine displays an intriguing profile of savory herbs, nori, barrel spices and graphite with dark fruit lurking beneath the surface and a citrus twist. There's minimal excess alcoholic fat. It's all flavor, with lively acids, a supple, polished feel and good depth and intensity?especially impressive considering the youth of this site (2005 plantings)."
US,86.0,21.0,Russian River Valley,Geyser Peak,This straightforward wine is bone dry and brisk in acidity. The pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon citrus flavors are enriched with riper notes of papayas. But there's also a strong streak of tart green gooseberries.
US,81.0,32.0,New Mexico,La Chiripada,"A spicy, candied fruitcake nose leads into slightly tart cherry flavors in this New Mexico Cab. The structure is good but the wine needs a bit more balance and depth. Still, it has potential."
US,87.0,26.0,Alexander Valley,Murphy-Goode,"This warm-climate wine is fulsome and hearty in baked Asian pear and candied ginger. A dried-fruit quality stands out on the buxom palate, a buttery taste of dried apricot drizzled in honey and brioche."
Italy,88.0,24.0,Morellino di Scansano,Fattoria Mantellassi,"This riserva shows tertiary aromas of leather and tobacco, behind notes of dried fruit and cassis. Also recognizable are bright tones of licorice and dried ginger that give the wine its lively personality. Drink now."
France,92.0,22.0,Chiroubles,Fabien Collonge,"Produced from 45-year-old vines, this is a fruity ripe wine. It has concentration and some firm tannins as well a generous black-fruit character. The wine's acidity and structure will allow it to age another year, so drink from late 2017."
Argentina,90.0,47.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Three years ago Trapiche started making three high-end single-vineyard Malbecs; Aciar's seems a little more closed and flat than its cousins, but it does pump forward with rock-solid blackberry and cola flavors. It's better on the attack than the follow-through, but the flavors are excellent and the balance is proper even if the length is short."
France,95.0,412.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau Latour,"Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend. The result is a wine that blends richness and power with an initially severe character. Slowly it opens to reveal opulent blackberry jam flavors, immensely ripe."
France,86.0,18.0,Languedoc,S. Delafont,"Made from 30% Cinsault, 30% Grenache, 20% mourvÃ¨dre and 20% Syrah, this offers direct cherry, watermelon, peach and citrus notes on the nose and mouth. Light weight and balanced, it's a refreshing and easygoing quaff that finishes briskly."
US,86.0,22.0,Rutherford,Red Cap,"It shows the variety's dryness, acidity and light, silky texture, with lemon, lime and gooseberry flavors that finish tart and spice."
US,92.0,38.0,Livermore Valley,Dante Robere,"Dense, saturated aromas and flavors blend ripe fruit with ample oaky spices to form a mouthcoating layer of goodness. This wine is medium bodied, but almost swaggering in style, and delicious. It has lots of firm tannins but the tempting flavors soften the texture and make it fun to drink."
Spain,88.0,16.0,Jerez,Bodegas BarÃ³n,"Lively but standard amontillado aromas of maple, honey and nuts are a touch fiery. Matching the nose, this is choppy and pulling on the palate. Salty, nutty, intensely dry flavors finish with hard-driving acidity that creates never-ending length."
US,87.0,32.0,Paso Robles,Opolo,"This is a big, ripe, extracted wine, softly tannic in the Paso Robles style. It's a little hot in alcohol, but delicious, with waves of blackberry jam, black licorice and spice flavors."
US,88.0,20.0,Rogue Valley,J. Scott Cellars,"Sweet graham cracker abounds, wrapped around a tart, lightly spicy note of apple. It's an interesting combination, a bit unusual, but it works."
US,82.0,15.0,Paso Robles,Maddalena,"Hot, soft and simple, with baked fruit flavors of cherries and red currants that turn raisiny on the finish. On the plus side, it's dry and silky."
US,91.0,65.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Bernardus,"Snappy black raspberry and fresh plum combine for an almost effervescent experience on the nose, which also benefits from smoked beef and carnation aromas. The palate is also very energetic with black-plum and orange-juice flavors, finishing with strong acidity. This will last for years, but needs at least another year to fully integrate."
US,92.0,136.0,Stags Leap District,Chimney Rock,"From an estate-grown, valley-floor vineyard on the southern edges of the winery property, this wine is complex and nuanced in berry pie and a satchel of dried herb. Sizable tannins?which show promise to be tamed with time?form the integrated structure, supporting a lengthy, mocha-chocolate finish. Cellar through 2020."
Argentina,83.0,13.0,San Juan,Graffigna,"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Rosso di Montalcino,San Lorenzo,"Blue flower, red berry, forest floor and a whiff of Mediterranean herb lead the nose. The racy, linear palate delivers black cherry, pomegranate and clove framed in sleek tannins and bracing acidity. A note of powdered sage closes the finish."
US,87.0,11.0,Finger Lakes,Three Brothers,"Luscious grapefruit and lychee juxtapose earthier notes of saffron and fennel that extend from nose to finish. It's a dry, full-bodied GewÃ¼rztraminer with sunny acidity lending freshness to the midpalate. Drink now through 2019."
US,92.0,50.0,Sonoma Mountain,Siduri,"Earthy and brawny in pungent compost aromas, this wine has a citrus-laden edge of crisp mineral and bitterroot. Full-bodied and richly layered, its fruit components are dipped in baked rhubarb and black tea."
US,94.0,70.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"A blend of several vineyards, including Kanzler, Quail Hill and Umino, with some Freestone also in the bottle, this wine was given an almost 50% whole-cluster fermentation. Crisp cherry, strawberry and an inviting squeeze of citrus sit atop darker notes of cinnamon toast, the whole awash in a floral flourish of orange blossom."
France,88.0,40.0,Champagne,Soutiran,"A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay from grand cru vineyards, this is a clean, precisely made wine that almost seems engineered?it's that crisply defined. It shows perfect, streaming, tiny bubbles, a tight, yeasty entry and a steely, concise finish."
US,86.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Genoa,"A blend of near-equal parts Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine brings aromas of overripe pear and apple and toasted grapenuts that lead to dry, lightly fruit flavors. It's a straightforward quaffer."
US,89.0,28.0,Edna Valley,Chamisal Vineyards,"Jasmine, honeysuckle and gardenia aromas show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers peach custard and ripe grapefruit skin scents. The palate is welcoming and very familiar, with butter, sea salt, lemon and ambrosia melon flavors, all framed by solid acidity."
Italy,87.0,10.0,Chianti Colli Senesi,Viticoltori Senesi Aretini,"Wild berry, savory herb and balsamic aromas take center stage in this medium-bodied red. The round palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of orange zest. Modest acidity and soft tannins make it extremely accessible."
France,89.0,30.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau FerriÃ¨re,This wine is full of bright fruit and attractive acidity. It's been made to take advantage of the fruitiness of the year and is likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2018.
US,88.0,25.0,Rogue Valley,RoxyAnn,"Blended with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in a mixture of French and American oak (50% new), this wine highlights notes of raspberries and cream speckled with oak spices and an herbal edge. The palate is light and elegant in style while still retaining a sense of depth, plushness and balance."
Spain,87.0,11.0,Rioja,Baron De Ley,"Fruity aromas of peach, nectarine and cantaloupe are just dry enough. This feels fresh and a touch citric, with mild flavors of orange and nectarine. A gentle, slightly pithy tasting finish is a good ending to this everyday rosÃ©."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Morellino di Scansano,Loacker,"Ripe black cherry, blackberry and black pepper sensations dominate this brooding blend of 86% Sangiovese and 14% Syrah. The spicy, dense palate is forward and warm accompanied by bracing tannins that carry through to the finish. It's shy on fresh acidity so best enjoy this soon."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Collosorbo,"Here's a concentrated, ripe and surprisingly rich Rosso di Montalcino that mimics many of the fine characteristics of its big sister, Brunello. The wine is smooth and slightly sweet in the mouth with bursting notes of ripe cherry and succulent strawberry."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Livio Felluga,"This is one of Italy's best Sauvignon Blancs. Crystalline and tonic in appearance, the wine offers generous tones of exotic fruit, pear and green apple backed by dried sage and chopped herbs. The mouthfeel is compact and clean but it's also persistent and dense enough to pair with sophisticated dishes."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Romagna,Fattoria Paradiso,"Subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and baking spice waft out of the glass. The straightforward palate evokes black plum, vanilla and tobacco while assertive tannins provide support. Drink through 2020."
Italy,91.0,80.0,Gattinara,Nervi,"Aromas of underbrush, mature berry, new leather, blue flower and menthol emerge in the glass. On the firmly structured palate, an intense mineral vein of iron underscores dried black cherry, white pepper, dried sage and star anise. Austere fine-grained tannins provide the taut framework."
US,83.0,11.0,California,Haute Red,"Judging by the high-heeled shoe on the label, this is one of those wines aimed at the female consumer. It's Pinot in name only, with clean, simple cherry candy and oak tastes."
US,91.0,48.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Baby Bear,"Baby Bear is a collaboration between Eric Dunham and the actor Kyle MacLachlan, styled as a lighter version of their Pursued by Bear Syrah. This is a most enjoyable wine, with a big yum factor from the generous barrel scents and flavors. Toasty, smoky, a bit astringent, but beautifully streamlined, it displays a full array of black fruits, adorned with lots of dusty, toasty barrel highlights."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Vettori,"Fresh and citrusy, this is heavy on tangerine and grapefruit aromas. It offers steady, foamy perlage that gives the wine softness and richness on the finish."
US,94.0,75.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"Concentrated and lively, this showcases luscious black cherry fruit that's perfectly framed with zippy acidity and ripe tannins. It's a full-bodied, New World style, but with a complex, layered finish that says Oregon rather than California."
Argentina,89.0,80.0,Uco Valley,O. Fournier,"Sweet aromas of black raisin and licorice are a good indicator of what's to come. This is one thick, jammy, softer-bodied wine that's ready to drink now. Flavors of saturated blackberry, mocha and black pepper are attractive, and the finish ends with molasses sweetness and espresso bitterness."
France,90.0,45.0,Auxey-Duresses,Morey-Blanc,"Deliciously fresh, this is almost delicate, certainly elegant. There is great balance here, the wood just lightly toasty over the smooth, creamy white fruit flavors. For a wine from a lesser Burgundy appellation, this is impressive."
US,87.0,18.0,Sierra Foothills,Di Arie,"Dense, layered and juicy, this has a good concentration of bright blackberry flavor. The small amounts of Primitivo and Barbera are subtly apparent. With a snap of chocolate on the finish, it's well rounded."
France,87.0,20.0,Premieres CÃ´tes de Blaye,Xavier Flouret,"A firm, ripe wine, with good sweet black currant fruit flavors. It is structured, but mainly showing fruit rather than tannins. There is a fine, fresh finish, hinting at wood."
Spain,91.0,60.0,Rioja,Licenciado,"Reduced, jammy aromas of boysenberry, plum and blueberry set up a woody, choppy feeling palate with tannins that need to mellow. Raisiny berry flavors are on the heavy side, while residual oak notes are prominent. A tannic, drawing finish is dense, woody and in need of settling. Drink through 2030."
US,88.0,39.0,Red Mountain,Corvus,"This 100% varietal is completely made with fruit from Red Mountain Vineyard. Brightly aromatic, the wine offers notes of cherry cordial, black licorice and vanilla, with the volatiles amped up but just in check. It's rich, high-octane and liquorous with abundant cranberry flavors."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Sicilia,Duca di Salaparuta,"Aromas of toasted oak, vanilla and dark berry take shape in the glass. The brooding palate offers black cherry, espresso, oak spices and a hint of grilled herb alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2016."
US,84.0,20.0,Green Valley,River Road,"Tastes manipulated, with oak, honey and buttercream flavors dominating the underlying apples and peaches."
US,91.0,40.0,Fiddletown,Terre Rouge,"This is a very solid, well-structured and deeply flavorful wine from the first whiff of blackberries and black pepper to the mouth-coating but dry flavors to the lingering spicy finish. Best to drink after 2018."
Italy,93.0,40.0,Chianti Rufina,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,"This cru expression of Sangiovese was born in 1974 and offers beautifully plush and rich aromas of dark chocolate, cherry and opulent vanilla. The wine is very smooth, soft and long-lasting in the mouth. It's a wonderful and very pleasurable wine."
US,90.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,La Pitchoune,"This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish."
US,84.0,10.0,North Coast,Corbett Canyon,"The earthy and leafy aromas are akin to Chilean Merlot. The plum flavors are attractive but there's also an indistinct berry/tomato taste that lowers the bar. A smooth, round, carefree wine better geared to casual parties than contemplative sipping."
US,88.0,28.0,Sonoma Valley,Anaba,"A blend of 43% Grenache, 41% MourvÃ©dre and 16% Syrah from two vineyard sites, one warmer than the other, this plummy red is bright on the palate. Smoky and not overly oaked, it contributes gamy twinges of black currant and cardamom to the long finish."
Italy,93.0,36.0,Etna,Graci,"Underbrush, menthol, new leather and black-skinned berry aromas emerge in the glass. The smooth, full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, baking spice, tobacco and mineral alongside firm, velvety tannins."
US,91.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Ottimino Vineyards,"From a selection of its best vineyards across the county, this producer showcases a majority of the variety with 16% Petite Sirah, all aged in French oak, 25% of it new. Black olive, spicy leather and cinnamon make for a bold, dry and boisterous wine that's entirely enjoyable, integrated in terms of both tannin and oak."
France,90.0,80.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Based in Nuits Saint-Georges, Aegerter has its own domaine around the town. This wine, with its new wood and spice flavors, is balanced with red-berry fruits and soft tannins. It will develop well and should be ready to drink from 2019."
US,88.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Red Tail Ridge,"Aromas of smoke and sweet apple introduce an intensely flavored palate that's full of ripe yellow peach, waxy flower and fresh fennel. Off-dry and bold in structure, it finishes with a hint of lanolin and a lingering minerality."
US,86.0,16.0,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,"A light tawny shade, this shows scents of straw and orange peel. The mouthfeel and somewhat deadened fruit flavors suggest some premature oxidation is occurring. Overall it lacks freshness, and should be consumed shortly."
Australia,92.0,100.0,Rutherglen,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,"Coffee-colored, with enticing scents of orange drizzled with dark maple syrup, coffee and raisins. Sweet, upfront and lushly textured, this is an easy-to-appreciate Muscat with great length."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Sicilia,Benanti,"LamorÃ¨mio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry. You'll also get a touch of caper or green olive that rides on the heels of the wine's smooth, supple mouthfeel."
US,91.0,15.0,Washington,SoDo,"This wine is mostly Grenache (70%) along with MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and peppery spices are light and pure. The red-fruit and plum flavors are elegant yet sumptuous in feel, with the oak pulled back. It's unabashedly appealing and a great value to boot."
US,93.0,108.0,Napa Valley,Alpha Omega,"With an underlying current of power and tension, this wine offers a wealth of chocolate, dust and tobacco leaf flavors, its texture softly layered with integrated tannin and oak. Complex and long on the finish, it continues to unravel in the glass."
US,88.0,42.0,Alexander Valley,Dewitt,"Smoky and soft, this boldly made wine is medium-bodied but burly in char, baked blackberry and cocoa powder, a hint of tobacco never far."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Prosecco,Bottega,"From the makers of one of Italy's most popular grappas, this vintage-dated Prosecco offers soothing aromas of peach, lime, white peach and spring flowers."
France,81.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Maison Sichel,An unattractive green-herb aroma is followed by a green-pepper- and dill-flavored palate.
US,92.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Volker Eisele Family Estate,"This subtle, classically-styled red includes 6% Merlot, all of the fruit hailing from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's bright with red and blue fruit and earthy accents of mushroom and clove. Moderate tannin buoy it without bogging it down, giving it broadness on the palate and carrying its flavors long into the finish."
Italy,92.0,54.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Castello Banfi,"Dense aromatics with black plum, game, leather, menthol, oak and anise notes open this full-throttle red.  The plate shows impressive depth of flavor with tart plum and bitter chocolate notes, as well as fine fruit to acid balance.  The long, dry, even finish wraps it up beautifully with black fruit and bitter chocolate notes."
US,86.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Argyle,"Ripe apples and toast on the nose of this Oregonian open to a medium-bodied wine with decent complexity and a soft foamy mousse. Crisp apple and herb flavors with a slight mineral note play out on the clean and tart finish, which displays good length."
US,85.0,28.0,Santa Maria Valley,Riverbench,"This Pinot is crisp and delicately structured, with a silky texture. But the cola, raspberry and red currant flavors are thin, leading to a fast finish. Drink now."
US,90.0,45.0,Chehalem Mountains,Rex Hill,"Young, sharp, oaky and wound up tightly, this is a focused wine of medium concentration. Green and yellow apples hold down the core of fruit, and trail out with a hint of butter on the tongue."
US,91.0,50.0,Yakima Valley,Brian Carter Cellars,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's a sophisticated blend that retains its youthful freshness. Deep flavors run from black cherry through cassis, adding streaks of licorice, baking chocolate and a hint of bark and herb. Supple, graceful and polished, this wine would seem to have another decade of life ahead."
Italy,91.0,22.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Perlage,"This stunning sparkler opens with lovely aromas of hawthorn, wisteria, white orchard fruit and herbs. The crisp, savory palate offers white peach, green apple, lemon zest and minerals while a creamy mousse softens the vibrant acidity."
France,91.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,ChÃ¢teau Saint Esteve d'Uchaux,"From a leading small domaine, this blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah is sure to make virtually any lover of RhÃ´ne wines smile. Crushed thyme accents ripe cherry fruit in this full-bodied, moderately rich wine that ends with a dusting of velvety tannins. Drink now??018."
France,92.0,45.0,Alsace,RieflÃ©,"Richly sweet, this is a wine that has traded primary fruitiness with deliciously balanced honey flavor and lively citrus acidity. It's a wine that has richness, intense flavor and the ability to age further."
Spain,83.0,45.0,Valdeorras,Valdesil,"Stalky white-fruit, lees and vanilla aromas are less than inviting. This feels tired, obtuse and out of shape, meaning it's past its prime and won't improve. Bitter, leesy peach and melon flavors finish similarly."
Spain,86.0,8.0,ValdepeÃ±as,Bodegas Los Llanos,"Ripe aromas of baked berry and raisin stop short of being too ripe. In the mouth, this basic Tempranillo is chunky but balanced by fresh acids. Plum, prune and spice flavors finish loamy and plump. Good wine for $8."
Argentina,90.0,24.0,Mendoza,Sur de los Andes,"Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance."
US,87.0,13.0,Contra Costa County,Cline,"This good varietal rosÃ© has a little more body and a little more breadth in the mouthfeel than many others, along with mild strawberry and cherry flavors that give it substance."
Spain,85.0,6.0,La Mancha,Venta Morales,"Big boysenberry aromas are lively, a bit minty and fresh, while the extracted palate has a fruit-driven personality, ample tannins and dark wild-berry flavors. Young, bouncy and tangy on the finish. Composed for a young, inexpensive red."
France,92.0,40.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau Durfort-Vivens,"This second wine of ChÃ¢teau Durfort-Vivens is ripe, firm and well structured. Beautiful ripe black currant and berry fruits are cut with intense acidity. From the great 2010 vintage, it is solid, dense and full of fruitiness as well as tannins. It still does need to age, so drink from 2017."
France,89.0,13.0,Vin de Pays d'Oc,Domaine de Nizas,"A ripe, smooth wine, dominated by vanilla from wood and by red berry fruits. The tannic structure is subservient to the rich layers of mint and herbal flavors, while the fruit dominates. Finishes with chocolate and firm tannins."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Toscana,Poggio al Tesoro,"Here's a bold expression of Cabernet Franc that leads with intense aromas of blackberry, tobacco and balsamic herbs. The richly textured palate delivers a tight core of black cherry, spice and graphite, with bracing but ripe tannins that need a few more years to tame."
US,89.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"Merlot gives this wine a broad and flavorful midpalate of mixed berry and currant and cherry fruit; it's got plenty of acid below and tannin behind, and it lays out beautifully across the palate. The finishing tannins are lightly earthy, lightly chocolaty, and suggest pencil shavings and a splash of anise as well. Excellent value."
US,90.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Arbor Crest,"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years."
US,85.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Smasne Cellars,"A sweet-and-sour wine that mixes sour lemon candy with honey cough-drop elements. There is also an underlying streak of baby aspirin flavor, and the different aspects of the wine are not quite pulled together."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Fosso Corno,"The nose doesn't give much away while the no-frills palate offers dried black cherry, a hint of spice and a slightly green note of powdered sage. Loose knit tannins provide the easy-drinking framework."
US,89.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Brooks,"Juicy fruit flavors carry a pleasantly candied character, dappled with hints of cinnamon and pepper flakes. It's broad and appealing, with a touch of mint enlivening the finish."
US,89.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Silver Horse,"This unusual, but successful, combination of Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is a great example of modern Paso blending. Each grape variety fills in the deficiencies of the others, resulting in a harmonious whole. It has the tannic weight of Cabernet, with complex cherry, mocha, cola and spice flavors that drink well now. There's some burn in the finish that detracts."
Spain,84.0,21.0,Calatayud,Bodegas Langa,"This varietal Garnacha is chunky and heavily oaked on the nose, with woody aromas of vanilla and plastic. An overtly oaky, awkward feeling palate tastes of resin on top of plum and blackberry, while the finish shows more resin mixed with mint."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Calatayud,MarquÃ©s de MontaÃ±ana,"Dense and dark, this has earthy, crusty berry aromas and a sprinkle of herb on the nose. It hits with aggression but settles down nicely to offer raspberry, plum and savory herb flavors. Lively acidity allows for a long finish."
US,87.0,20.0,Monticello,The Boneyard,"Aromas of smoky peach, citrus blossom and crushed stone are enticing and inviting. The palate of this unoaked Chardonnay is restrained and green apple focused, with a refreshing lemon-lime vein running down the backbone."
US,91.0,38.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"A rich and complex Pinot that will need short-term cellaring. Brimming with flavors ranging from blackberries and cherries to earth, tobacco, sun-dried tomato and Oriental spices. Perfect tannins and acids make a lush, intriguing texture."
Italy,87.0,28.0,Friuli Isonzo,Vie di Romans,"The name of the wine is an old word used to measure fields, and reflects the Gallo (no connection with the California winery) family's use of traditional ideas and techniques at Vie de Romans. This wine has full, ripe fruit, soft and with layers of attractive wood and vanilla flavors."
France,88.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Castel des Maures,"This is an immediately attractive, fruity wine. Crisp acidity cuts through the red currant and berry fruits to give a light and refreshing wine that has a tight, mineral aftertaste."
US,93.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"Dark, bold, and full-bodied, this is the perfect embodiment of power and breed in a full-on (five grape) Bordeaux blend. Boysenberry, cassis, plenty of acidity?the nose promises a great deal, though it is reticent in the mouth, and fairly acidic. This is a wine to lay down and enjoy in a decade."
France,87.0,11.0,Pays d'Oc,Fortant,"Touches of crushed purple violets add depth and interest to the brambly black berry and raspberry core of this lush wine. Hints of menthol and charred oak dance in the background, with flavors of cherry skin and blackberry taking centerstage on the solidly structured palate."
US,88.0,43.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reininger,"An unusual aroma profile of sandalwood, broccoli and exotic spices leads to coffee and dark cherries. The fruit flavors are silky in feel, showing plenty of depth with lightly grainy tannins supporting them."
US,83.0,22.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"Bright gold in color, with creamy custard and caramel aromas. The palate is soft, with banana, baked apple and corn-like flavors, while the finish is heavy and rather mute. Very thick and heavy given the level of balance, acidity and fruit pedigree."
US,85.0,110.0,Oak Knoll District,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,"Juicy in blackberry and cassis, with a strong Bordeaux-varietal rush of peppercorn and herb, this wine leans green and tight on the palate, aiming for a classical style from a cool year and cool region."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Trento,Altemasi,"Aromas of lemon blossom, pear and citrus lead the nose, with a whiff of bread dough. The dry palate delivers mature yellow apple, lemon zest and toasted almond alongside bright acidity and a lively perlage."
US,87.0,21.0,Virginia,Veramar,"This seductive Cabernet Franc opens up with aromas of cherry, vanilla and spice leading into layers of blackberry, plum, cinnamon and cedar on the palate. Fruit and spice are balanced here, and medium tannins means the wine can age. Paired with roasted duck or beef, the wine is a sure hit."
Argentina,84.0,11.0,San Juan,Casa Montes,"Wiry herbal aromas of blueberry and currant lead to an acidic citrusy palate that's choppy and a bit rough. Quick-hitting plum and currant flavors are herbal before hollowing out on a zesty, tannic finish."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Moscato d'Asti,Marchesi di Barolo,"Deliciously light and creamy, this has a bright flower aroma, followed by touches of honey and stone fruit. Pair it with pastries, fresh fruits or baked apricots."
Argentina,92.0,135.0,Mendoza,Bodega Catena Zapata,"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021."
US,89.0,59.0,Napa Valley,Stein Family,"This is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot, and 5% undisclosed varieties. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.5%. The flavors are of black currants, cassis, softened cola and leather, with plenty of peppery spices. Should hold in the bottle for a few years, but fine to drink now, after a few hours of decanting to let it breathe."
France,84.0,13.0,CorbiÃ¨res,Castelmaure,"A pale copper-pink color, this rosÃ© is light and easygoing, with soft notes of red cherry, strawberry and muddled orange on the nose and mouth. The finish is short, but clean."
US,84.0,20.0,Virginia,Tarara,"Broad notes of white orchard fruit lead onto the light- to medium-bodied palate, which feels easygoing and pliable."
US,92.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"Coming from a site across from Cold Creek, this wine offers notes of toast, sautÃ©ed herbs, blackberry and spice. It's rich, power packed and layered with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins?an excellent mixture of power and elegance."
US,89.0,30.0,Calaveras County,Newsome-Harlow,"This is almost the anti-Napa Bordeaux blend. It's drier and edgier than your typical North Coast Cab, and much less tannic, with a sweet herb edge to the flavors of cherries, red and black currant, plums, tangerine zest, licorice and cloves. Try this polished wine with anything calling for a medium-bodied red."
US,87.0,20.0,Anderson Valley,Navarro,"An earthy aroma, light apricot and lemon flavors and crisp, tangy texture add up to a lean, medium-bodied and refreshing wine made from Pinot Noir grapes."
France,95.0,500.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc,"Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024."
US,92.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Shafer,"True to its full-bodied, burly profile, this blend of 89% Syrah and 11% Petite Sirah packs a powerful punch and needs further time to open. For now, a reduced sense of baked coconut, plum and black pepper struggle for identity, with shocks of dark chocolate and velvet. Drink now through 2020."
France,90.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Louis Jadot,"This Jadot is a combo of long-term contract vineyards and its RÃ©gniÃ© Cru, demonstrating that knowing the terroir makes a difference. The blend shows well in this rich, full wine. It reveals ripeness?round and full of strawberry flavors from the 100% Gamay, with a tight layer of mineral acidity at the end."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Morellino di Scansano,Terre di Fiori,"Aromas of red berry and balsamic herbs provide the focus of this vibrant and easy-going wine made entirely with Sangiovese. The lush palate offers black cherry and a hint of licorice alongside firm but ripe tannins. There's no complexity, but this enjoyable red is perfect to pair with everyday fare. Drink now. Wine4All, Specialty Wine."
Spain,89.0,36.0,Jumilla,Pico Madama,"It's not easy assessing this blend of Monastrell and Petit Verdot from a warm vintage. It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors. It's not missing any potency or ripeness, but the longer you work with it the larger and more medicinal it gets. Think big Zinfandel from California when you take this on."
Spain,85.0,11.0,Rioja,Rio Madre,"Cherry, raspberry and candied aromas announce a plump but bland palate with sweet, candied flavors of red fruits. These turn slightly harsh before finishing with good feel and controlled bitterness."
Australia,90.0,15.0,Victoria,McPherson Wine Company,"Made with enough skin contact to yield a gentle coppery hue, this medium-bodied wine features aromas of cantaloupe, cherry and citrus. Cherry fruit on the palate is accompanied by vaguely Pinot Noir-like notes of dried bracken and moss, then glides to a long, silky finish. Drink now."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Moscato d'Asti,Marchesi Incisa della Rocchetta,"Aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and white flower lead the nose. The savory creamy palate doles out juicy peach, candied nectarine zest, sage and mineral alongside a softly foaming perlage. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors."
US,86.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Genoa,"An unusual blend of Viognier (50%), Chardonnay (19%), Sauvignon Blanc (19%) and Pinot Grigio, this wine offers reserved aromas of ripe banana that lead to stone fruit and citrus flavors that drink a hair off dry. The varieties don't entirely mesh but it still brings enjoyment."
US,87.0,25.0,Monterey,Wine Spots,"Aromas of yellow melon, faint wood and just a touch of nuttiness greet the nose on this bottling from Daniel LeFrancois' globetrotting brand. Barrel smoke hits the front of the palate, then evolves into golden pear and marzipan with a slightly oxidized but pleasant finish."
US,87.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Armanino Family Cellars,"This is a 100% Cabernet Sauvignon that's shy on the nose and softly approachable on the palate. Herbal and dry, it is couched in solidly built tannin and weight, with leathery graphite and cedar pronouncing themselves around a full body."
US,86.0,40.0,Rogue Valley,Griffin Creek,"Syrah can be expressive even when slightly green, as it is here. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors are set amidst sharp, slightly chalky, citrusy acids. Best to drink this with grilled meats."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Villa Calcinaia,"This wine unfolds with aromas of underbrush, toasted sensations and black fruit with a whiff of balsamic herbs. The palate delivers vibrant black cherry, black currant and oak-driven flavors including coffee and chocolate. It finishes on an astringent note of wood tannins. The Marchetto Company, Imports Inc., Pio Imports."
US,88.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Houdini,"Here's a good, useful Cabernet with some real elegance. It's bone dry and sturdy in tannins, with solid blackberry and currant flavors leading to a long, sweet finish. Drink over the next three years."
US,89.0,44.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"Smooth and chocolaty, this full-bodied wine is blended from a majority of Sangiovese along with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Petite Verdot. It has a very dark color, concentrated and jammy fruit flavors, a streak of sweetness and a plush texture. It's quite tannic so the sugar helps soften the grip on the palate."
France,86.0,11.0,Touraine,La ConfrÃ©rie de Oisly et ThÃ©sÃ©e,"This is an up-front fruity wine with tangy acidity and a crisp texture. It is still young, still almost raw in its character and needs a few months to calm down. But it will be an attractive zesty wine full of fruit. Drink from 2018."
France,91.0,30.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Collin-Bourisset,"With its crisp texture, this wine is bright and fruity, with good acidity and a complex background of spice, vanilla and yellow fruits. The wine is deliciously balanced and ready to drink."
US,87.0,24.0,Mendocino County,Claudia Springs,"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak."
US,84.0,7.0,California,Domino,"Fruity and slightly herbal aromas and flavors give a tasty character to this light-bodied and slightly sweet wine. It has an agreeable, uncomplicated fruitiness and a soft texture."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Mendoza,Benegas,"With ripe aromas of cough syrup, baked berry, cherry and smoke, this Malbec offers a bit of everything. The palate is full but has energy, and the flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and chocolate come in a big, pounding wave. Finishes chunky and jammy, with adequate freshness."
Italy,91.0,73.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Le Salette,"Cassis, blue flower, baking spice, grilled herb and a whiff of new leather lead the nose. The chewy palate offers dried black cherry, mature plum, chewing tobacco and nutmeg alongside fine-grained tannins. Despite its solid structure, it also has elegance and freshness."
US,94.0,65.0,Willamette Valley,Nicolas-Jay,"A stunning debut for this new boutique, a joint project between Jean-Nicolas MÃ©o (Domaine MÃ©o-Camuzet) and Jay Boberg, co-founder of the IRS Records music label. Deep and penetrating fruit flavors of blackberry and raspberry are buttressed by ample, proportionate acids and tannins. There's a graceful touch of fresh herb, along with black tea and clean loam."
US,87.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Waterstone,"Waterstone's non-reserve Cabernet is often quite good and the '05 is just about their best ever. It's a fine wine, dry and full-bodied and rich in black currants, smoky oak and spices. Drink now and for the next several years."
Italy,96.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Baricci,"Enticing perfumed berry, violet, new leather and a truffle scents emerge in this textbook Brunello. On the savory, full-bodied palate, licorice, clove and chopped herb flavors accent a juicy core of ripe black cherry fruit. Firm, refined tannins provide structure. It's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020??032."
US,87.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Tyee,"Quite dry, nicely structured, and sporting generous, fresh acidity, this food-friendly Pinot Gris has moderately ripe fruit flavors that emphasis citrus and lemon rind. The alcohol is just 13.5%."
US,91.0,38.0,Temecula Valley,Robert Renzoni,"Approachable and jubilant rose petal, root beer, charred meat and ripe cherry aromas show on the dynamic nose of this bottling. The flavors are tighter and more focused, recalling red cherry, rust, tobacco and lava rock minerality. Tannins coat the palate with a delicate grip."
France,93.0,27.0,Alsace,Domaine BarmÃ¨s-Buecher,"Yeasty funk hovers above rich beckoning peach. The dry palate then expands and comprises taut, translucent citrus, exuding a cool calm charm. This is slender and fresh and shows concentration but no heaviness. It's a wonderfully fine-boned delicate Riesling of subtle power. Impressive long and whistle-clean finish."
US,80.0,17.0,Monterey County,Ronan,"Sugary sweet, with flavors of cherry jam and LifeSaver raspberry candy."
Italy,86.0,35.0,Franciacorta,La Montina,"This brut has heavy aromas of liqueur di dosage, along with subdued citrus and pear notes. It lacks fruit richness and finishes on a dry, bitter note of walnut."
US,90.0,15.0,Mendocino,Monte Volpe,"Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance."
US,90.0,45.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"Pale copper colored, this wine is more focused on mineral than fruit expression, with aromas of wet stone out in front of citrus rind. The medium-bodied flavors dance lightly on the palate but still show concentration, texture and balance."
Spain,89.0,24.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Terras Gauda,"This is a little heavy and oily on the nose, with blowsy white-fruit aromas. It feels peachy and smooth, with key flavor components of melon, apple and pear. This shows some extra heft, ending with a subtle and smooth finish."
France,92.0,35.0,Bandol,Domaines Bunan,"The main estate of the Bunan family is a citadel from the 18th century. This wine is perfumed, rich with pepper as well as ripe red fruits. Structure from the dominant MourvÃ¨dre in the blend gives some tannins and a sense of power. Drink from early 2017."
US,87.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Judd's Hill,"A good Cabernet for drinking now, with some extra features of fanciness. It's dry, soft and packs plenty of blackberry and cherry jam flavors."
Argentina,92.0,48.0,CalchaquÃ­ Valley,El Esteco,"Potent but integrated oak and blackberry aromas come with a note of licorice. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is blocky and almost collapses under its own weight. Herbal, spicy flavors of fresh mushroom, roasted plum and tomato are typical of Salta. It finishes full, saturated and a bit chunky. Drink through 2020."
Italy,93.0,75.0,Barolo,Curto Marco,"Aromas of fragrant purple flower, dark-skinned berry, new leather and a whiff of crushed botanical herb float out of the glass. The savory, full-bodied palate doles out layers of juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and anise while polished, fine-grained tannins lend finesse and structure. Orange peel and an earthy hint of game lend depth. Drink 2019??025."
US,93.0,28.0,Wahluke Slope,Waters,"This is the winery's first commercial release of this varietal, all aged in neutral French oak. It offers nuanced aromas of spice, tobacco, vanilla and savory notes that are followed by plentiful, palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that extend out through a long, fruit and spice-filled finish. Firm tannins provide the structure. It needs time still but possesses a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore."
US,82.0,13.0,California,Chime,"Watery and sweet, like fruit juice, with orange, pineapple and buttered toast flavors."
France,92.0,75.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Roche de Bellene,"This is part of a collection of wines from old vine parcels put together by Nicolas Potel. The wine comes from vines up to 62-years-old, that are rich in opulent fruitiness which is shot through with acidity. Wood aging has added a toasty character without losing any sight of the fruit. It is a fine wine that should age further. Drink from 2018."
Italy,89.0,15.0,Barbera d'Asti,Coppo,"This textbook Barbera opens with classic varietal aromas of dark berry, blue flower and ground spice. The vibrant, full-flavored palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry and licorice notes alongside fresh acidity and smooth tannins. It's made for sheer drinking pleasure, so enjoy soon."
Italy,92.0,29.0,Chianti Classico,Isole e Olena,"Here's a structured but elegant wine that opens with aromas of wild berry, mint, clove and a balsamic note. The firm, fresh palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, menthol, white pepper, grilled herb and a note of well-integrated oak while velvety tannins provide support. It's great now but it will be even better in a few years. Drink through 2020."
US,95.0,250.0,Napa Valley,Cardinale,"The vintage was generally a good one in Napa Valley, and with this '09, Cardinale shows its usual sumptuousness. It's beautiful and elegant, with hard, chewy tannins framing intensely concentrated blackberries and cassis. Blended from various vineyards by winemaker Chris Carpenter, the wine is as stylish as Napa Cabernet gets. Full bodied and heady, it should provide good drinking over the next 12 years."
France,91.0,58.0,Beaune,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"Bold brush strokes characterize this wine, the fruit a complex mÃ©lange of red berries, acidity and weight. The wine has good density, offering a strawberry jam character to go with the fresh edge. Tannins are enveloped in the fruits, promising medium-term aging."
Australia,92.0,26.0,Coonawarra,Yalumba,"Menzies is the name of Yalumba's Coonawarra estate, which is almost entirely devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon. Like most of the Yalumba wines, the oak levels have been pared back in recent vintages, allowing this wine's cassis fruit to to shine. Hints of tobacco, bay leaf and sage bring complexity, while the tannins are fine, adding a softly dusty feel to the long finish."
US,89.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Balboa,"From the new Summit View vineyard, this tart, racy Roussanne is done in a steely style, with accents of mineral and citrus rind. Don't look for the usual lushness of the grape; but there is plenty of flavor nonetheless. Pepper and rind, orange  peel and hints of apple are nicely integrated."
US,88.0,120.0,Howell Mountain,Peace Water,"Cranberry and a strong herbal component contribute an earthy elegance to this 100% Cab which zigzags somewhat on the palate, becoming fuller bodied. Still, the oak and tannins are under control and the wine is approachable now."
US,83.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Swedish Hill,"A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension."
US,84.0,28.0,Monterey,Radog,"Simple and soft, with thinned-down, candied cherry, cola and oak flavors that finish dry and spicy. Drink now."
US,88.0,39.0,Los Carneros,V. Sattui,"Right out of the bottle, this is tight, but airing coaxes out plenty of cherry, currant and tart persimmon flavors, with a pretty mouthfeel. Give this some time in the decanter to breathe and mellow."
US,85.0,39.0,El Dorado,Bumgarner,"This is a big, almost overpowering Cab that has mint and cedar streaks running through its classic cassis flavor."
US,92.0,48.0,Red Mountain,Mark Ryan,"Hailing from Ciel du Cheval and Force Majeure vineyards, this aromatic wine offers pomegranate, dried leaves, mocha and crushed flowers. It's luxuriously creamy in feel with abundant red fruit flavors."
US,88.0,16.0,Calaveras County,Newsome-Harlow,"A juicy, tropical Sauvignon Blanc ripe for warm weather sipping, textured in mango, pineapple and a hit of fresh pear. Intense with a savory taste on the finish, this white is perfect on its own or ideal with seafood or crackers smothered in goat cheese."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Gen5,Strong spicy meaty aromas and equally assertive oak and char flavors threaten to overwhelm the fruity aspects of this dry wine but it has enough concentration to match the firm tannins. Best after 2020.
US,91.0,60.0,St. Helena,Salvestrin,"This is a huge, extracted Cabernet Sauvignon. It's just what people expect Napa Cabernet to be: ripe, heady, oaky and bold. With deep, classy cassis, plum and chocolate flavors, it should develop additional nuances after 2017."
US,92.0,38.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,McIntyre Vineyards,"This wine is an interesting journey from sniff to sip. Aromas of condensed pomegranate, hibiscus and red plum are lifted by crushed slate, light clove, marjoram and a whiff of smoke. Full flavors of red plum and cranberry start the palate, then come waves of herbaceous oregano, thyme and pepper, before the red fruit returns toward the finish."
France,87.0,16.0,Sable de Camargue,Vignobles Jeanjean,"This organic rosÃ© leads with mineral aromas that are framed by fruity notes of yellow peach, melon and green mango. The palate is clean and direct, with attractive vibrancy and freshness that carries through to the softly herbal finish. Drink now."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Utiel-Requena,Corolilla,"Woodsy, perfumed and light on the nose, this has rosebud and lemon peel aromas. The palate shows a touch of resiny oak, with flavors of raspberry and chocolate, ending with a hint of vanilla."
US,88.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Chehalem,"Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon. With barely perceptible residual sugar, the acids keep it lip-smacking and lively. There is just a hint of buttery caramel at the core."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Veronese,Suavia,"This lively, elegant white, made with 100% Trebbiano, opens with heady scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit. The vibrant, linear palate delivers white peach, crunchy pear, tangerine and a mineral note. Racy acidity provides balance and generates a crisp, clean finish."
US,88.0,30.0,Umpqua Valley,Brandborg,"Brandborg has established a style that is well-suited to the locale, and their Pinots are perfectly balanced and mix in spices and fresh herbs with the tart, cool climate fruit. This is a crisp, unpretentious style of Oregon Pinot."
France,89.0,27.0,Gers,Domaine de Gensac,"A blend that includes Syrah and Tannat as well as Bordeaux grapes, this is a wood-aged, ripe and rich wine. A tense streak of acidity heightens the effect of the black currant fruits. Spice at the end comes from the wood. Drink from 2016."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Barolo,La Fusina,"Oak, ripe dark-skinned fruit, menthol, grilled herbs and brown cooking spice aromas lead the way. The firm palate offers baked black cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate, espresso and anise accompanied by firm, refined tannins. It's well balanced and already almost accessible."
Italy,82.0,17.0,Veneto,Zardetto,This is an extremely simple rosÃ© sparkler with medium aromas of wild berry and red rose backed by crisp freshness and bright perlage. It is a simple and thin bubbly overall.
US,88.0,20.0,Chehalem Mountains,Raptor Ridge,"The winery's consistently flavorful version of this grape puts a New World spin on an Old World grape. It's ripe, round and lightly spicy, with jicama, cucumber and fleshy pear fruit. The finish is persistent and tags you with a touch of heat."
US,87.0,25.0,Chehalem Mountains,Daedalus Cellars,"This is the first Chardonnay for Daedalus Cellars. Flavors are rich and full-bodied, with candied orange peel, sweet citrus and vanilla most noticeable among them. Left on the lees for almost 18 months, this is wide open and ready to drink."
Italy,94.0,150.0,Barolo,Vietti,"Dark berry, chopped mint, sage, tobacco and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this. Firmly structured and youthfully austere, the palate delivers red cherry, raspberry compote, anise and clove framed in vibrant acidity and tightly-woven tannins that give it a firm finish. It needs time to fully come together and develop complexity. Drink 2025??043."
US,85.0,13.0,Central Coast,Sterling,"On the thin side, with watered-down blackberry and currant flavors, but gets the Cabernet job done effectively, at a fair price. It's full bodied and tannic, with a spicy finish."
Argentina,86.0,33.0,Mendoza,Carmelo Patti,"Aromas of tire rubber, black cherry and citrus peel are tight and closed. This feels dry and tannic, with little give. Dark-berry flavors come with a dash of salt, while this remains salty and feels dried out on the finish."
Argentina,85.0,12.0,Mendoza,Alfredo Roca,"Mild white-fruit aromas are nonspecific but clean. This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay has a simple, citrusy palate feel and briny nectarine flavors. A briny flavor quality remains on the finish."
US,85.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Van Duzer,"The wine is noted as off dry on the back label, but you won't taste any sweetness whatsoever. It's tart, green, almost sour, with green apple fruit that hints at cardboard in the finish."
Italy,89.0,75.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fuligni,"Fuligni delivers a bright and sharp Brunello with medium build and tight forest berry aromas. The acidity leaves your mouth as clean as a whistle, and the wine imparts lingering tones of chopped mint, cola and dried ginger on the close."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Produttori Bolzano,"Tomato vine, elderflower, cut grass and tropical fruit aromas lead the nose on this vibrant wine. The savory palate offers honeydew melon, peach, grapefruit and flinty mineral while zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish."
Italy,93.0,30.0,Collio,Mario Schiopetto,"Here's a structured white that boasts a classic varietal fragrance of cantaloup and tomato vine. The delicious palate delivers melon, pineapple and mineral flavors of great depth and impeccable balance. This will pair magically with asparagus recipes."
Spain,86.0,12.0,PenedÃ¨s,JuvÃ© y Camps,"Peach pit, almond skin and other dry, waxy aromas carry the nose on this Macabeo-Xarello-Parellada blend. Flavors of lime and nettle are playful and acid-based, while the finish seems wet and fresh. Overall it is much like a cava without the bubbles."
Italy,88.0,13.0,Chianti Colli Senesi,Fattoria Del Cerro,"A nice surprise from the Chianti Colli Senesi wine region, this Sangiovese-based wine is fresh and bright, and it comes with berry aromas that are followed by blue flower and wet earth notes."
US,86.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Cakebread,"Oak dominates this wine, with toasty charcoal aromas and flavors. The underlying wine seems pretty simple, with blackberry fruit flavors. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up."
US,91.0,32.0,Paso Robles,Waterloo,"A brick red in color, this bottling of an usually blended variety is quite compelling and delicious, starting with the intriguing nose of pine needle and smashed red plum. The palate picks up MourvÃ¨dre's leathery hallmark, which gives rustic elegance to the red cherry and pine needle spice."
US,88.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cadaretta,"A one-of-a-kind 100% Sangiovese from Cadaretta, this pure and expressive wine shows concentrated strawberry fruit presented in a balanced style with acids and tannins in perfect proportion. There is no hint of new oak, just a softening from barrel aging, and a lovely presentation of the pretty young fruit."
US,89.0,52.0,Paso Robles,Leverage,"Restrained on the nose, this blend of 41% Grenache, 32% Syrah and 22% MourvÃ¨dre offers black plum, milk chocolate, purple flower and vanilla on the nose. Black peppercorns show strongly on the palate along with black-plum skins and cola, but this still needs some bottle age to emerge to full potential."
US,85.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,Portalupi,"An unripe streak of mushrooms and green veggies runs right through the middle of this dry Pinot. That mars enjoyment of it, despite some black cherry and cola flavors. Drink up."
US,93.0,52.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Talbott,"Salted peaches, dried apricots, sliced lemons, crushed vanilla beans and oak smoke mark the nose of this wine, sourced from one of the appellation's biggest and oldest vineyards. It's light and crisp on the salty palate, with a fleshy apple flavor, racy acidity and slate-driven minerality."
US,85.0,28.0,Rogue Valley,Del Rio,"The herbal side of the grape dominates here, in both aromas and flavors. The mixed red berries have a wild, mountain-grown flavor, with streaks of green bean. Acids are chalky, and a thoughtful food pairing?something meaty and pepper-crusted?is what will bring out the best in this wine."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Agricola Querciabella,Jammy fruit and strawberry aromas characterize the nose of this chewy Chianti Classico. You'll appreciate the juicy softness and velvety qualities it imparts in the mouth.
US,97.0,75.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6?? years."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Villa Poggio Salvi,"An aging wine with a garnet-ruby color and bricking at the rim. Aromas of barbecue smoke, cured meat, leather, tobacco and dark fruit give way to tight, finely textured tannins on the palate."
Italy,87.0,50.0,Barbaresco,La Spinetta,"This opens with subdued aromas of French wood, grilled herb, forest floor and dark spice. The firmly structured palate shows espresso, toast, powdered sage and licorice but not much fruit richness. Grainy drying tannins leave an astringent mouthfeel."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Alicante,Telmo RodrÃ­guez,"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable."
US,91.0,75.0,Coombsville,Silverado,"This is an inaugural release of this variety from the Mount George Vineyard in cool Coombsville, granted AVA status in 2011. Juicy and soft in blackberry and stone fruit, the wine is cradled by generous tannins and herbal tones. Full bodied, its sinewy structure suggests it would benefit from more time in bottle; cellar through 2022."
US,85.0,19.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Methven Family Vineyards,"Fragrant, with a grapy appeal, this pure Gamay Noir comes on like a fresh Beaujolais. The cherry candy flavor is fruity and fun, but the wine thins out rapidly onto a quick finish."
US,85.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Ancient Oak Cellars,"Soft and sweet, this Pinot has simple but appealing raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. It would score higher if the texture was more potent."
US,92.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Hoopla,"A wonderful array of aromas wafts up from the glass, resembling pencil shavings (a good thing!), cigar box, touch of earthiness and cherry compote. The mouthfeel is luxurious; layered flavors of black currant, black cherry, chocolate and clove stay lively through the long finish. It drinks well now, but will improve through at least 2019."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Cava,Freixenet,"Freixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose. It feels crisp and focused, with a foamy palate that brings apple, lime, peach and spice flavors. The finish is smooth."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Puglia,Tenuta Coppadoro,"Delicate and pink, this fragrant rosÃ© offers immediate floral tones that recall rose, violet and lavender. There's good quality of fruit here: It's lively and vibrant and the wine imparts both power and freshness on the close."
US,85.0,22.0,Applegate Valley,Schmidt,"This is done in a soft, loose-knit, wide-open style?not the usual crisp and racy Riesling found in the Northwest. Apple and orange fruits are accented with notes of cracker and grain. It feels a bit flat in the finish. Drink up."
France,95.0,163.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Canon,"Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power."
US,88.0,45.0,Sonoma Valley,Hanna,"Big, ripe, chocolaty wine, with lots of forward, smooth, oaky flavors. Easy to like, with a plush, creamy mouthfeel, and tons of new oak flavor."
US,94.0,62.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"Cinnamon spice and pomegranate fruit give a soft touch to minerally driven aromas of black slate and wet cement on the nose of this block-designated (and trademarked!) wine. The wine's tannic grip and tartness are apparent on the texturally distinct palate before raspberry, hibiscus and rose petal flavors settle into a long, rich finish."
US,86.0,40.0,Oregon,Merrill Cellars,"This is a rustic Syrah, with a simple, grapy flavor. The tannins are a bit rough-and-tumble, but the wine is perfectly quaffable with burgers or pizzas."
Australia,92.0,30.0,Pyrenees,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier,"This partnership continues to turn out marvelously complex wines from inland Victoria. Savory, herbal and intriguing on the nose, with hints of raspberry, mushroom and smoked meat, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine. Dusty tannins impart a silky quality to the finish. Drink now??018."
US,89.0,17.0,Edna Valley,Tangent,"Very pithy aromas of grapefruit, squeezed lemon, crisp Asian pear and a touch of chalk show on the nose of this bottling, another strong argument about how well this variety can do in cool coastal California. The flavors are light and crisp, with yellow apple and yellow-grapefruit pith most prominent."
US,84.0,11.0,California,Beaulieu Vineyard,"A candy bar of a Cabernet, with chocolate, blackberry, brown sugar, roasted almond and vanilla flavors. Clean and easy, at a fair price."
Argentina,85.0,17.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Slightly baked and raisiny on the nose, with char and licorice aromas backing that up. The palate is more acidic than you'd expect, with an outsized zesty bite to go with snappy, herbal plum and cherry tomato flavors. Baked and warm on the finish."
Australia,95.0,300.0,Rutherglen,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,"This Muscat is the color of dark coffee, with a greenish inflection at the rim, showing the high average age of the blend. It is incredibly rich and sweet?it pretty much oozes across the palate with intense flavors of molasses and dried dates before finishing long, long, long. A wine you can still taste minutes after spitting or swallowing."
US,93.0,34.0,Santa Maria Valley,Brophy Clark,"Nearing the 20-year anniversary of their winery, career vintners John Clark and Kelley Brophy Clark make solid wines such as this one, which shows marjoram, cardamom and crushed rose-petal aromas against a pomegranate juice frame. It's lush and lively once sipped, with dried strawberries and raspberries lifted with lavender and pencil lead, all flavors that keep going and going."
Argentina,82.0,11.0,Tupungato,Andeluna,"Green smelling. Feels thick, grabby and stewed, with herbal, saucy flavors of tomato and red berry. That same sauciness defines the herbal finish."
France,93.0,55.0,Chablis,William FÃ¨vre,"This is a rich, round and full-bodied wine with smooth, creamy apple and pear flavors. It is cut through with zingy lemon acidity and a touch of honey. The structure comes from a cool line of lemon zest, minerality and a tight, taut aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
US,84.0,12.0,California,Grayson,"This isn't the most complicated Pinot Noir, but it is a clean, easy-drinking wine. With raspberry and cherry flavors wrapped into a silky texture, it will be fine to drink with burgers."
US,91.0,33.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Santa Barbara Winery,"Incredibly dark in the glass, this bottling of a rarely planted but quite fascinating Northern Italian grape show crushed graphite, turned earth, concentrated blueberry and elderberry, and a touch of purple flowers on the brooding nose. Ripe black currants start the sip before waves of powerful acidity, gravelly minerality and peppery spice take hold."
Argentina,83.0,10.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Brambly smelling, with tomato, green herb and rhubarb aromas. Nervy and tight in the mouth, with minty, spicy flavors that keep any fruit character in the distance. Scratchy and tannic as well."
US,87.0,70.0,Stags Leap District,Shafer,"This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much."
US,91.0,42.0,Yakima Valley,OS Winery,"Dark, sappy and syrupy, this jet-black, 100% Syrah mixes superconcentrated raspberry compote with espresso, smoke and hints of pepper bacon. There is nothing shy here, but the wine is authoritative and splashy, a Syrah that does not taste like all the other Syrahs made in Washington. Despite alcohol levels just under 15% the wine keeps its shape and its detail, and the tannins are smooth and polished. A fine effort from winemaker Bill Owen."
US,89.0,16.0,Edna Valley,Bishop's Peak,"This is another fine Chardonnay from Talley, a great Central Coast producer. This is the second label, and for the price, you'll get a terrific Chardonnay that's creamy and rich in oranges, kiwi fruits and golden mangoes, but bright in acidity."
Italy,91.0,19.0,Trento,Rotari,"A new product from Rotari, this Riserva sparkling wine (from 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero) demonstrates great intensity and round, toasty flavors of fresh baguette, baked apple, honey and fruit. The wine rests on the lees for 48 months for extra creaminess."
France,85.0,16.0,CÃ´te Chalonnaise,Vignerons de Buxy,"This is light and fruity, with its red fruit upfront. The tannins are balanced, in keeping with the wine's perfumed nature. The youthful acidity on the finish is likely to soften out in a year."
Spain,88.0,21.0,Rueda,Blanco Nieva,"Minerally grapefruit, white peach, lettuce and scallion aromas are clean, inviting and textbook for Verdejo. A fresh, racy, cleansing palate holds grapefruit, orange and briny flavors. This is crisp as a whistle on the finish, but light on flavor and complexity. Drink now."
US,90.0,20.0,Lake County,Vigilance,"Citrus and herb aromas and crisp, inviting flavors make this medium-bodied wine hard to resist. Nicely dry, well balanced and lively with acidity, it has a lingering finish."
US,88.0,23.0,Wahluke Slope,Saint Laurent,"A dusty, cinnamon-inflected Syrah bursting with blackberries. Persistent flavors play across the palate, with a streak of citrus showing the underlying acidity."
Argentina,90.0,19.0,Mendoza,Finca Perdriel,"Dig into this if you like superripe, rich Malbec. This is loaded with graphite, smoky oak, blackberry and baking spice aromas. Expect maximum ripeness across the palate, meaning bearish flavors of berry fruits, wood and toast. There's not a lot of distance or complexity to the finish, but getting that far is half the fun."
US,88.0,22.0,Finger Lakes,Ventosa,"The scents of ripe red berries and cassis are inviting on this nervy Pinot Noir. The palate is bright with red fruit marked with hints of wet stone and grippy, velvety tannins. Finishes with a fragrant spray of cherry blossoms."
US,84.0,62.0,Russian River Valley,Gracianna,"From an estate vineyard, this wine is somewhat unformed and quite feral, largely tannic, with a rough-hewn texture. The oak is overwhelming and needs time to settle, to better reveal the abundance of strawberry and cherry fruit."
US,91.0,30.0,North Coast,Head High,"Beautifully concentrated and rich, this wine is so dense with black fruit and dark-chocolate flavors that it's almost chewy. Blended from nine grape varieties, it has a wealth of fine-grained tannins and feels velvety in texture, while the powerful, layered flavors linger on the finish."
US,87.0,22.0,Napa Valley,Silverado,"This is dry, but lushly fruity, with sour-candy pineapple, lemon, lime and white-sugar flavors leading to a clean finish. This bottling for Silverado has been variable over the years, but worth checking out."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Navarra,PrÃ­ncipe de Viana,"Rubbery, woodsy aromas of wild berries and balsamic vinegar are spicy and suggestive of Bordeaux. Leafy flavors of plum, pie cherry and spice are herbal but not green, while this value blend's peppery, dry finish is juicy and composed."
US,90.0,65.0,Stags Leap District,Robinson Family Vineyards,"You can taste the California sun in every sip of this rich, forward Cab Franc. It oozes ripe raspberries and cherries, drizzled with milk chocolate and sprinkled with toasted star anise and vanilla. Fortunately, a good structure of tannins and acidity provides needed balance. Drink now??015."
US,88.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"This full-bodied wine is ripe and concentrated, showing cherry and rosemary aromas and fully developed fruit flavors. An expansive, mouthfilling texture is supported by fine-grained tannins."
US,93.0,26.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Melville,"A brilliant balance of ripe ruby-red grapefruit juice and corresponding bitter-sour elements from the same fruit's pith mesh with tangerine oil, crushed ant, iodine and a bit of dairy funk on the nose of this wine. The palate's grippy texture shows apple peels, Key lime pith, baking soda and an almost peppery zing, suggesting lots of life. Drink 2016??023."
Argentina,89.0,28.0,Mendoza,VinEcol,"This is a textbook Deep Purple special: huge berry, menthol and violet aromas create a hefty, lusty bouquet. In the mouth, it is more narrow than you might hope for, with staunch tartaric acidity. Jammy berry flavors are big but standard, as is the finish. Drink through 2018."
US,91.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Kokomo,"Smoky aromas give this wine allure, its layers of flavor soft and flowery, accented by red berry fruit. On the elegant spectrum of the variety, the wine is fairly subtle, with an evolving cinnamon spiciness to the finish."
Spain,87.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Dominio de Eguren,"Broad and ripe on the nose, with sappy blackberry, plum and youthful aromas. The palate is big, full and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors in front of a smoky, hickory-driven finish. Chewy, blowsy and generous for $10 Tempranillo."
US,89.0,36.0,Sonoma Valley,Bartholomew Park,"An unmistakable meatiness marks the nose, and then there's some Middle Eastern spices like cumin and coriander. Earthy and full of black-fruit flavor, with oak pouring in late. Try to ignore the bulky young tannins; assume the wine will mature and find its stride down the road."
Australia,92.0,70.0,McLaren Vale,Kilikanoon,"Aged in 100% new French oak, this wine opens with scents of vanilla and pipe tobacco, but also shows a strong core of ripe raspberries. Mixed berries take over on the palate, softly framed by layers of mocha and vanilla. This full-bodied wine's tannins are creamy in texture, just turning ever so slightly dusty on the long finish. Drink now-2023."
US,88.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (OR),Panther Creek,"Sourced from 35-year-old Wente clone vines, this offers bright apple with hints of peach. It's medium bodied and streaked with flavors of caramel and butterfinger candy."
France,92.0,43.0,Alsace,Sipp Mack,"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure."
France,86.0,15.0,Fronton,ChÃ¢teau Coutinel,"Fronton's NÃ©grette grape is found in few other places. Made 100% from the single variety, this wine displays the grape's juicy character as well as the spice and violet aromas and damson flavors. The wine is made to be drunk young."
US,97.0,35.0,El Dorado,Donkey & Goat,"A seriously top of the heap California Syrah. This complex, interesting wine sings of black pepper and garrigue, fleshy in just-ripe cherry, leather and dark plum. From the mountainous Fenaughty Vineyard, always a good source, it finishes long and will age gorgeously if you can possibly wait to drink it; that pepper will mellow in interesting ways."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Conte Collalto,"This estate is a clear cut leader in the Conegliano subzone of Prosecco Superiore. Not only does it produce great sparkling wines, but it offers an entire ecosystem of farming, agriculture and animal breeding that follows a stringent model of ecological sustainability. Hats off for this clean and focused bubbly."
France,88.0,30.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Beauvillage,"Ripe and juicy, this is packed with black currant fruit and lined with soft, open tannins. The wine has a dry core, yet this is surrounded by attractive smoky fruit and bright acidity. Ready to drink now."
US,90.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Elizabeth Chambers,"This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip."
US,90.0,39.0,Russian River Valley,Patz & Hall,"A strong, insistent Chardonnay, brimming with oak, acidity and very ripe tangerine, pineapple, Asian pear, lime and honey flavors. It's dry and tart, with a mineral edge. Should develop for a few years."
Italy,91.0,54.0,Barolo,Rizieri,"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, chopped sage, wild berry and a whiff of leather. On the full-bodied palate, notes of cinnamon and licorice add depth to dark cherry and raspberry compote while a tannic backbone lends structure. Drink 2021??028."
US,87.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Burgess,"Has the luscious tannins and beautiful acids you expect from Napa, and some rich plummy, berry flavors. Also possesses a depth and weight that are appropriate for the price. There's a bit of roughness, though, that detracts."
US,82.0,19.0,Finger Lakes,Ravines,"Earthy aromas of Chardonnay fruit and toast lead on this wine with a   somewhat prickly character. Lean and simple, it wants more spice and a softer mouthfeel to make it work."
Australia,88.0,40.0,Clare Valley,Knappstein,"This is a full-bodied, well structured Cabernet, with plenty of intense cassis fruit tinged with minty, herbal overtones that give it a slightly medicinal cast. Give it 2-3 years to develop additional complexity, then drink it over the next 7-8 years."
US,92.0,28.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"Light and delicate aromas of lime curd, vanilla yogurt and a touch of pear custard show in a very pleasing manner on the nose of this vineyard-blend bottling. The palate is expertly rounded, with wet riverstone, yellow apple, lime zest and creamy white fruit like cherimoya and ripe nectarine."
US,88.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Jacob Franklin,"Marked by enormously ripe, powerful fruit flavors, this wine explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries and red plums. Oak adds even richer notes of toast and sweet caramel. Drink this deliciously soft wine now."
US,85.0,10.0,California,Twin Arches,It's well-suited for supplying a big party where there are lots of different tastes to please. A soft texture and almost sweet butter and apple flavors make this a light confection.
Italy,90.0,59.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Cerbaia,"This opens with aromas of ripe berry, cake spice, leather and blue flower. The juicy medium-bodied palate offers black plum, wild cherry, coffee and star anise framed in chewy rounded tannins."
Canada,93.0,18.0,Beamsville Bench,Cave Spring,"This is a dry-style Riesling, though it still lends a ripe, fruity impression. Lemon, lime and grapefruit are shuffled into a winning hand, with ample details of cilantro, fennel and wet stone. It's a vibrant, refreshing wine that is immensely food friendly."
US,88.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Clos du Val,"This is a dry, tannic and somewhat earthy Merlot. The structure is impeccably elegant, and there's a wealth of herb-infused blackberry and currant fruit flavor that makes it rewarding."
US,91.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Baldassari Family Wines,"Tart and herbal in sage, this is a densely concentrated wine that wraps its head around black cherry, cranberry, pomegranate and black tea. A note of freshly baked bread pokes through on the nose and within the fruitier, savory flavors."
US,89.0,65.0,Willamette Valley,Erath,"This is the reserve of the Erath lineup and the winery's best effort?along with the Battle Creek bottling?in 2010. Pretty scents and flavors of raspberry and rose water mingle with the ripest cherry fruit in the lineup. Focused, balanced and elegant."
Australia,88.0,70.0,Barossa,Yalumba,"Tri-Centenary refers to the fact that these vines have lived in parts of three centuries, being planted prior to 1901. The 2006 isn't the most profoundly complex of recent vintages, but instead offers remarkably pure essences of cherries and berries, allied to a wonderfully silky texture that makes it awfully easy to drink."
US,87.0,19.0,Paso Robles,Midnight,"This everyday drinker leads with concentrated but mellow aromas of black plum, turned earth, anise and sweet mint. It's quite full on the palate, with baked red fruit and baking spice flavors. Very fruit-forward."
Italy,89.0,22.0,Greco di Tufo,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond."
France,91.0,24.0,Alsace,Trimbach,"Pear laced with subtle notes of smoke hints at a taut palate. The dryness and discipline of the poised flavors nonetheless allow the ripe, luscious pear fruit to glow and shine. Mouthfeel and texture are reminiscent of pear peel and bitter almond, and echo long after the last sip."
US,94.0,75.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Serene,"This Dijon clone fruit, barrel fermented and aged on the lees, delivers a wine of exceptional concentration and intensity. Deeply fruity, with a lush mix of apple, pear and peach, it also brings flashy barrel flavors and impressive length. The persistent, tightly wound finish bodes well for further aging. Drink now through 2028."
US,87.0,20.0,Long Island,WÃ¶lffer,"Whispers of leather and granitic soil lend rugged appeal to this slightly savory, subdued Merlot. Bright acidity adds lift and light to the midpalate, accentuating flavors of crisp black cherry and cassis. It's supple and round, yet finishes curt and brisk."
France,91.0,38.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Tour Grand Faurie,"Still very young, this ripe Merlot-dominated wine is packed with dark plum and rich damson fruit flavors. They balance the serious amount of wood influence that gives it its spice and ageability. Drink from 2023."
Italy,90.0,150.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,ZymÃ¨,"The nose of this wine leads with forward oak and vanilla aromas. The palate offers more personality and ripe, luscious fruit flavors, with additional notes of spice and toast. While it shows some complexity, it's fast approaching its optimum drinking window, so enjoy soon."
US,93.0,42.0,Sonoma Mountain,La Follette,"Tangy, juicy, fresh and fun, this vineyard-designate, a consistent star in this producer's arsenal, is densely layered, supported by an oak structure. Black plum, black cherry and raspberry cross paths to offer a spark of ripe fruit before succumbing to several shakes of Asian spice."
US,92.0,70.0,Mount Veeder,Robert Craig,"This is a very lush Cab, made in the modern style. All the elements of cult Cab are there: the soft voluptuousness, the finely ground, sweet tannins, the immensely ripe currant, blackberry and cocoa flavors, the coating of fine, smoky oak. I don't think it's an ager because of the softness and ripeness."
US,91.0,58.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down."
US,86.0,50.0,Rutherford,St. SupÃ©ry,"Thick, rich and woody, this herbal, estate-grown red shows a wealth of baked-plum flavor laced in vanilla, with richness bursting on the finish."
US,83.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Jeff Gordon,"This is a thin, unfussy wine that imparts bell pepper and asparagus in a sea of green flavor."
US,88.0,38.0,Alexander Valley,Wattle Creek,"Interesting that they call it Shiraz instead of Syrah. Either way, it's a very dry, tannic and fairly complex wine, rich in blackberry, currant, tobacco and pepper flavors. Drink this robust, astringent young wine now with roasted meats and stews."
US,91.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Hourglass,"This beautifully brings out and blends the crisp citrus side of the grape variety along with a touch of riper fruit flavor that's shaped by oak aging. It offers classic, grassy aromas, thirst-quenchingly tart flavors and very light touches of vanilla and nutmeg."
France,94.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,"Dried hayflowers and dried orange peel send a lifted scent. The palate is richer and rounder than the nose suggests, full of ample apple and pear fruit, but guided and held by fresh, clean acidity. A certain earthiness shimmers with almost tropical hints of mango. The finish is dry, briskly clean but very lingering."
US,88.0,60.0,Carneros,Robert Mondavi,"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak."
US,81.0,12.0,California,Cambridge & Sunset,"Feels pinched and harsh in the mouth, with simple, sweet blackberry Pop-Tart flavors."
US,82.0,10.0,California,Firefly Ridge,"This is a simple, rustic wine, with flavors of raspberry and cherry."
US,89.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),:Nota Bene,"Roughly half Grenache, 38% Syrah and 10% MourvÃ¨dre, this shows intriguing aromas of black fruits, citrus, pine needle and loam. In the mouth there is a somewhat disjointed impression, with raspberry fruit and coffee grounds dominating."
US,91.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,La Crema,"This is an impressive wine at the price and production level, a great go-to for multiple occasions. It delivers earthy, candied strawberry around a light, bright core, remaining soft and smooth in texture and intensity, finishing with a tease of milk chocolate."
US,85.0,75.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"Sweet in chocolate-covered cherries and crÃ¨me de cassis, but turns a bit thin on the finish, and could use greater concentration, especially at this price."
US,88.0,27.0,Paso Robles,San Antonio,"This blend of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache and MourvÃ¨dre offers a wide array of aromas to start, from cocoa and mocha to brown spice, gingerbread, dark purple fruits and potpourri. The palate shows lavender, blueberry-strawberry juice, roasted oregano and thyme."
US,95.0,38.0,Red Mountain,Seven Hills,"A top-notch vintage for this bottling, it's a blend of 39% Merlot (from the original 1976 block), 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petit Verdot and 11% Cabernet Franc. Roses, blackberries, cassis and baking spices are beautifully rendered in a wine rich in depth and detail. More bottle age will surely bring greater complexity and soften the astringent tannins."
US,90.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Sweet Cheeks,"This bright and spicy wine refreshes with palate-cleansing minerality. The crisp, fresh-cut pear and apple fruit carries hints of orange liqueur. Drink this while it's in the bloom of youth."
US,92.0,150.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"This wine is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot and 8% Merlot, coming from Seven Hills, Loess and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. Light aromas of toast, barrel tones, flowers, licorice and dark fruit are followed by earth and other savory flavors that are light but still show weight and density."
US,86.0,25.0,Washington,Frenchman's Gulch,"Sourced from the excellent Lewis Vineyard, this toasty, chewy Syrah displays black cherry fruit against a strong background of vanilla. At first it seems tart to the point of being almost sour, but as it breathes, the oak mutes some of the acid and balances it out."
France,84.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Louis Chevallier,"A red fruit flavored wine, light and packed with acidity. The wine may not have the richness of the vintage, but it does have a fine line in red cherry flavors. Drink now."
US,86.0,10.0,California,One Leaf,"The flavors of this full-bodied wine are ripe and the texture soft, so it gives a feeling of being broad and relaxed on the palate. Aromas recall cola and dark berries, and the flavors resemble stewed cherries."
France,91.0,14.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Coste Peyrouse,"This is a balanced and stylish wine, with a solid base of solid tannins and a dry core that gives strength to the blackberry fruit and acidity. There is minerality as well as a firm, austere finish. Age for 4?? years."
US,84.0,23.0,California,Bota Box,"Light aromas turn to vivid floral and fruity flavors in this semisweet and light-bodied wine. It's low in acidity and should taste quite nice with wedding cake, seriously."
US,84.0,28.0,Clear Lake,Ceago Vinegarden,"Ceago's Reserve seems a little top-heavy in oak. The caramel and woodsap coating smothers the underlying wine, which is very fine, to judge by the winery's '07 unoaked Chard."
France,84.0,13.0,Chinon,ChÃ¢teau Coudray Montpensier,"As fresh as they come, with bright strawberry flavors touched by caramel and red currant acidity. For drinking this summer."
US,86.0,21.0,Monterey,Scheid Vineyards,"Here's a dry, elegant Grenache for drinking now. It has a silky texture, with slightly rough tannins and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mocha, pepper and herbs."
Australia,92.0,75.0,Yarra Valley,Yarra Yering,"Folks who enjoy herbal complexities in their Cabernet shouldn't pass this wine up. Aromas of roasted peppers, eucalyptus and cassis verge on vegetal, but the flavors are more refined, layering rich chocolaty notes over cassis and hints of green pepper. It's only medium-bodied, but still packs in plenty of intensity, evidenced on the long, silky finish. Drink now??020."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Cacchiano,"Juicy and powerfully structured, this vibrant red boasts aromas of underbrush, game and mature plum. The palate offers cherry marinated in spirits, juicy raspberry, white pepper, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink through 2019."
US,88.0,35.0,Wahluke Slope,Januik,"This is a relatively gentle, light Cabernet Franc. It reveals a pretty, juicy blueberry flavor as well as a muted herb note. A whiff of violet and a dash of vanilla run through the finish."
US,86.0,39.0,Sonoma Valley,Charles Creek,"A bit herbal and earthy, with some green tannins, this 100% Cab was mostly grown in the Mayacamas Mountains overlooking Sonoma Valley. It's dry and soft, with suggestions of cherries, blackberries and currants."
US,88.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Hightower,"This is an intriguing wine, with the extraction and the alcohol seemingly dialed back. Somewhat light in color, it brings aromas of fresh herb, sweet spice, cedar and cherry. The flavors are elegant and cranberry tart. It doesn't come off as entirely varietal but there's plenty of enjoyment to be had, especially if paired with food."
US,93.0,140.0,Stags Leap District,Pine Ridge,"Velvety thick with black fruit and pepper notes, this wine is firm with tense, fully structured tannin?a powerful backbone that contributes complexity and concentration."
US,90.0,24.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ampelos,"Good price for a Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir this good. Shows lots of zippy acidity and is very dry, with complex layers of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola and dusty spices. Drink now."
US,87.0,36.0,Virginia,Rappahannock Cellars,"Raw pastry dough, blackberry jam and vanilla aromatics are offset by cigar box and leather notes. Compared to Rappahannock's nonreserve 2010 Cabernet Franc, this wine feels warmer due to its alcohol, which is more than 1% higher than the nonreserve bottling. The palate is chewy and muscular, with flavors of dried rose petal and espresso that surface late."
US,87.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Gia Domella,"Not for the faint-hearted, this Zin is brawny and tannic, and high alcohol gives it a fierce burn. But it's fully dry, and has strong, deep flavors of dark forest berries, leather, tobacco and peppery spices. Now??012."
US,88.0,14.0,Monterey,Maddalena,"Stakes out the dry, acidic, minerally side of Pinot Grigio's personality, with citrus fruit and spice flavors and a mouthwatering quality that's exactly what you want in inexpensive bottlings of this variety. Lovely as a cocktail sipper, or with appetizers ranging from puff pastries to bruschetta."
US,87.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Youngberg Hill Vineyards,"This is chewy and tannic, with sharp edges around cranberry fruit. It's blocky and one-dimensional, but solid and substantial. If Pinot Noir can ever be a steak wine, this is it. A touch of anise and coffee winds it down through the finish."
US,84.0,8.0,California,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,"Light bodied and lightly flavored, this wine is a good, basic meal-time beverage. It is dry, nicely tart and nearly neutral in aroma and flavor."
US,81.0,11.0,Paso Robles,Purple Cowboy,"Simple and tart, this has green mint and sour cherry-candy flavors."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Barolo,Negretti,"This opens with attractive aromas of pressed rose, woodland berry, dried herb and a whiff of baking spice. The robust palate shows sour, almost unripe cherry, clove, mocha and anisette. The warmth of evident alcohol closes the finish."
Italy,89.0,36.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Villa S. Anna,"Delicate coconut, vanilla and plum aromas mingle in the glass. The subtle palate reveals licorice, cherry extract, espresso and a hint of vanilla, held together by tightly wound tannins and fresh acidity."
Italy,84.0,38.0,Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore,CondÃ©,"Despite the care that has gone into making this wine (it sees up to 18 months of barrel aging), the results are slightly muddled and disjointed. Ripe strawberry jam is followed by toasted spice and a touch of wood resin."
US,91.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Duckhorn,"From a warm site on the valley floor, this wine is soft and velvety, approachable and sophisticated. An additional 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot provide complexity and further softness, the wine buoyant in juicy blueberry, currant and fig."
Spain,80.0,15.0,Toro,Estancia Piedra,"This is two consecutive vintages of sketchy to poor rosÃ© from this label. This one smells a bit like a swimming pool, while the flavors are of tart nectarine and pickle. Doesn't much cut it."
US,88.0,22.0,Santa Barbara County,Melville,"New oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and vanilla dominating the tropical fruit, orange and Meyer lemon flavors. It's finely constructed, with deft acidity and a stony minerality. Drink now??013."
US,92.0,42.0,Yakima Valley,DeLille,"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the aromas start out quiet, with notes of cherry, wood spice and dark fruit. The flavors are reserved and polished, showing an exquisite sense of balance and a lingering finish."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Andreola,"This sparkler shows some distant sweetness and loads of fruity softness that comes forward as peach, nectarine and honeydew melon. It is a textbook example of an off-dry Prosecco Superiore that is perfect as an aperitivo wine."
US,87.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Savannah-Chanelle,"Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy."
US,87.0,27.0,Carneros,Sonoma-Loeb,"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control."
France,88.0,22.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Belle-Vue,"Belle-Vue changed its usual blend for 2012 to emphasize the ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. That gives a fresh black currant-flavored wine that is layered with ripe tannins and acidity. Fruity, it will develop quickly, so drink from 2017."
US,85.0,24.0,Mendocino Ridge,Phillips Hill,"This light-bodied wine is a bit sweet and sugary, balanced by crisp apple flavors and a tangy touch of acidity. It's good and thirst-quenching."
US,91.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Rex Hill,"Flint and flower aromatics introduce this wine, which follows with delicate (for the vintage) flavors of apple and mineral. It was aged 12 months in a concrete egg, and finished in stainless steel."
US,91.0,55.0,Dundee Hills,WillaKenzie Estate,"This aromatic barrel selection employs multiple clones, from a winery which lays claim to farming more Pinot Noir clones than any in Oregon. Black cherry, cola and spice combine, leading into pinpoint tannins with a pleasing sweetness from the barrel aging. Drink over the next five years."
US,92.0,45.0,Green Valley,Sequana,"Just delicious, showing the promise of the 2010 vintage. The wine is ripe and intense in red cherry, cranberry and spice flavors, with a rich jacket of smoky oak. Feels like pure silk, while notable alcohol provides a boost of warmth for a chilly evening."
US,92.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Bjornstad,"Pretty much as good as Bjornstad's single-vineyard bottlings. It's opulent and creamy, with exotic tropical fruit, green apple, pear and honey flavors, elaborately oaked and spicy. Wonderful acidity gives a clean scour to all the richness."
US,85.0,50.0,Sonoma County,Viansa,"A bit too soft, which makes the exceptionally ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors stand alone and lack structure. Tasty and flashy, but the palate longs for more acids and tannins."
US,87.0,24.0,Texas High Plains,Spicewood,"Punchy raspberry and strawberry aromas mingle with darker shades of blueberry, with tarragon and anise in the background. Soft and silken on the palate, the flavors mimic the nose, supported by a gentle dusting of tannins. This is a perfect light-bodied summer red, great alongside grilled fare."
US,88.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,Brian Carter Cellars,"This is Brian Carter's SuperTuscan blend?âSangiovese-dominated with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Syrah. Stiff and unyielding when first opened, it rewards decanting with a broader expression of black, tarry fruits, black olives, coffee beans and dark chocolate."
US,88.0,10.0,Willamette Valley,ChÃ¢teau Bianca,"Spicy and dry, this is done to a wickedly tart finish; the flavors are set up beautifully to accompany food. The floral and rose petal scents of the grape are nicely rendered but not overwhelming, and the 1% RS residual sugar is almost invisible given the juicy fruit and acids."
US,92.0,65.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Kings Mountain,"The winery's annual 100% new French-oak bottling, this is rich and smoky, with heavily clove-laced blackberry and blueberry juice, dark strawberry, nutmeg and gingerbread spice on the nose. Similar flavors show on the palate, from mace to dried ginger. A bright red-cherry and cranberry character lifts the sip, as does the juniper and forest-floor finish."
France,85.0,15.0,Corse,Union de Vignerons de l'Ãle de BeautÃ©,"This light, crisp and fruity wine dances in the glass. With the acidity from Niellucciu very present, it's lively and bright, with a delicious final tang. Drink now."
US,89.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mosquito Fleet,"Sophisticated winemaking is evident here. The blending is well done, and the mix of raspberry, cherry and plum fruits reflects the Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot components. Half the barrels were French, half American oak. A little more punch in the finish would elevate the score."
US,88.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,Avennia,"Two thirds Boushey Vineyard, and one third Red Willow, this pure Sauvignon Blanc has not yet completely knit itself together. There's a solid core of clean and tangy ripe lemon, citrus and pineapple fruit. The finish is where it lacks some focus, and may benefit from another year or two of bottle age."
US,91.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,McCrea,"Dry and delicate with mixed fresh herbs, melon, green berry, spice and rock?lots of rock. It shows surprising length and develops nicely in the throat, seeming to add flesh as you taste. A really nice bottle."
US,85.0,29.0,Monticello,Michael Shaps,"Pastry notes of caramel, vanilla and mint chocolate are the lead aromas of this Cabernet Franc, but savory touches of wood smoke and thyme surface with air. Fine, tight tannins grab at the back end of the medium-bodied  palate before finishing with a sanguine-like tang."
France,89.0,30.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Roquetaillade la Grange,"The aromas are of new wood and toast as much as fruit, and this follows on the palate. It has strong burnt-toast flavors along with a full textured palate. Blackberry fruits are under this weight of wood, and need several years to emerge, although the wine will always have a strong wood component. Drink from 2017"
US,91.0,40.0,Santa Maria Valley,Storm,"Superripe in raspberries and cherries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak, this Pinot Noir is a little lacking in subtlety. But it has excellent acidity, minerality and even some firm tannins, and that structure gives it elegance. A bit brusque now, but will be fascinating to watch it develop over the next six years."
Italy,87.0,26.0,Barbera d'Alba,Fontanabianca,"This pretty vineyard-designate Barbera d'Alba delivers a fresh bouquet of floral, fruit and spice aromas. The wine is tonic and firm with a bright, crisp close."
US,90.0,30.0,Sonoma Coast,Rodney Strong,"From cool, coastal sites, this wine impresses in full-bodied layers of lavender, smoke and forest floor, the fruit distinctly plum. Generous tannic structure gives it strength and power that's countered by bright, integrated acidity."
US,87.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Dumas Station,"Reserved aromas of ripe red apple, cherry, dried herbs and spice are followed by quite ripe black fruit flavors speckled with vanilla and cocoa notes. It doesn't all come together perfectly but still provides interest."
France,87.0,15.0,Alsace,W. Gisselbrecht,"The nose beguiles, with scents of vanilla, freshly baked bread and wet stones that give way to tones of lemon and apricot on the tongue. This wine is light-bodied and crisp, a good summer sipper. Drink up over the next year, perhaps with a piece of grilled fish."
US,83.0,65.0,Northern Sonoma,Constant,"This wine is soft both in acidity and tannins, and simple and semisweet, with sugared raspberry tea and cola flavors, and isn't going anywhere."
US,83.0,15.0,Napa Valley,Aquinas,"Soft and simple, with chocolaty flavors of blackberry and cherry jam. With low acidity, the tannins provide the only opportunity for balance."
France,85.0,15.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine Foretal,"Firm tannins make this wine solid and dry. It has banana and bright cherry fruits well integrated with the acidity. The aftertaste suggests the wine could benefit from a few more months before drinking, so wait until 2017."
US,84.0,19.0,Oregon,Wine by Joe,"The white wines in the Wine By Joe portfolio are fresh, well-made and offer exceptional value. It's tougher to do with Oregon Pinot Noir. This thin, disjointed and simple wine has aggressive vegetal character and unappealing earthiness."
US,87.0,16.0,Washington,Boomtown,"A nice companion to the Boomtown Merlot, this shows similar balance and depth, albeit with an accent on tart berry fruit flavors dusted with dried herbs. There are citrusy acids and a hint of moist earth."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Toscana,Caiarossa,"Made with 90% Sangiovese, 4% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has restrained aromas recalling mature black-skinned fruit and leather. The approachable palate delivers ripe plum and cedar alongside smooth tannins."
US,85.0,22.0,Santa Barbara County,Mosby,"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine."
US,90.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Buena Vista,"This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine. The fruit tends dark and brooding, with a brambly character balanced against the crispness of acidity. The spiciness persists through the finish."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore,Giovanna Madonia,"Pipe and chewing tobacco appear at first and are followed by mature tones of prune, plum and dark spice. This masculine and brawny expression has the acidity to pair with deep pan pizza piled high with toppings."
US,94.0,63.0,Willamette Valley,Ken Wright,"A lovely hue, this is scented with crushed rose petals and raspberries. It's tart, with zippy acidity, and a terrific midpalate lift. The finish resonates with a coating of cafÃ© crÃªme."
Italy,85.0,11.0,Salento,Mondo del Vino,"Some leather, teriyaki and cured meat notes give this wine a dark first impression. Ripe cherry and raspberry jam flavors appear on the soft finish."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Seems as though this medium-sweet Viura-Malvasia blend has gotten better in recent years as the winery has dialed down the sweetness and weight. Lately, this vintage included, Satinela has been fresh, cleanly made and easygoing, with sweet pear and peach flavors and not too much weight or residual sugar. Captures the essence of medium sweet."
US,90.0,43.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ryan Cochrane,"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan."
France,92.0,38.0,Alsace,Cave de RibeauvillÃ©,"Showing signs of maturity, this is a delicious, rich and ripe wine, full of citrus, mineral and perfumed white fruits. Though rich, it is also bone dry, with tight texture and powerful acidity."
Canada,90.0,70.0,Niagara-On-The-Lake,Pillitteri,"A very pretty wine with a refined aroma profile of wild strawberry, wet stone, dried cherry and peppery spice backed by rich, candied fruit flavors that manage retain deftness."
US,84.0,13.0,California,Murphy-Goode,"Simple and sweet, with candied lemon, lime, orange and vanilla flavors. But it's crisp in balancing acidity. At this price, a good cocktail sipper."
France,93.0,22.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Boeckel,"Chalky, stony notes come to the forefront on this austere, restrained, non-dosed vintage crÃ©mant. The taut texture carries green apple and citrus tones, with a satisfying, savory soy sauce backdrop. This is poised and precise, fresh and refreshing, clean and structured?a testament to the nobility of Chardonnay."
US,85.0,39.0,Sonoma Valley,Muscardini,"This very dry Cabernet feels rugged and gritty in the mouth, with too much acidity that lends bite. The austerity is relieved by black cherry and sweet tobacco flavors. Drink up."
France,95.0,300.0,Champagne,Jacquesson et Fils,"From one of the few Chardonnay vineyards in Dizy, this is a tight wine, with a steely character, very crisp and citric. Even at nine years age, it tastes young, structured, demanding aging."
Argentina,89.0,30.0,Mendoza,Otero Ramos,"Baked loamy berry aromas come with a reedy rooty note of licorice. This feels good but jammy and a touch flat. Jammy raspberry, plum and currant flavors finish spicy and lightly herbal. Drink now."
US,88.0,45.0,Paso Robles,Hunt Cellars,"Clay and minty cola aromas give nuance to the soft, dark, perfectly ripe blueberry fruit on the nose of this wine. Fine-grained but sticky tannins and a pinch of acidity frame the sip, where dark-roast espresso, beef char and cigar smoke flavors reign."
Argentina,82.0,9.0,Mendoza,Aconga,"Red cherry and plum aromas are citric in style, while the palate is quite citrusy, too, with flavors of plum skin and pie cherry. This finishes tannic and grabby."
US,92.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Rendarrio Vineyards,"From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas. Blackberry and boysenberry also arise on the sip, with olive, pepper and pretty violet floral flavors, all framed by a solidly dry structure."
US,90.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Full Pull & Friends,"Aromas offer an assortment of high-toned black licorice, woodspice and dark-cherry notes. The rich black-fruit flavors reflect the warm vintage while staying in balance."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Dancing Bull,"This has a white pepper flavor, plus acids and green tannins that join forces to make the palate feel jagged. With its berry and currant flavors, this needs to be paired with rich meats and cheeses for balance."
Italy,91.0,20.0,Chianti Classico,Bibbiano,"This charming wine has a bright character, showing notes of juicy wild cherry, mint and eucalyptus and accents of leather and truffle. Drink now or wait a few years for tannins to tame down."
Italy,84.0,11.0,Chianti,Terre del Principe,"There's berry and rhubarb-like aromas and dried cherry flavors that have hints of tobacco, vanilla and leather. All of this sounds good, but the elements seemed to disappear too quickly in the glass. After only a few moments the wine seemed a pale shadow of the initial elements, and finished dry and a bit hollow."
US,89.0,36.0,Yakima Valley,The Walls,"The aromas are light, with notes of candle wax, herb and spice. The palate brings a light but still rounded, creamy feel that carries through the lingering finish."
Italy,89.0,54.0,Franciacorta,Bellavista,"Displaying its Chardonnay pedigree, this creamy sparkler opens with a floral fragrance of peach blossom, acacia, honey and walnut. Golden Delicious apple and citrus dominate the palate, balanced by bright acidity. It finishes on a hazelnut note."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Trento,Ferrari,"From one of Trento's leading wineries, this salmon-colored wine made from Pinot Nero and Chardonnay opens with aromas of rose, red berry and a whiff of nut paste. The palate displays more Pinot Nero, with wild cherry, strawberry and graphite flavors alongside a vibrant perlage and brisk acidity."
Argentina,89.0,20.0,Valle de Uco,Zuccardi,"Earthy notes of compost and murk blend with oak and black-fruit aromas to form the nose. While this feels a bit spiky and high in tartaric acidity, flavors of vanilla and berry fruits are good. A finish with plum-based flavors, overt oak and scratchy acidity is par for the course."
US,92.0,45.0,Santa Barbara County,Vie Winery,Scents of effervescent cherry and mint run with emergent licorice and slate on this wine that proves lithe yet flavorful on the palate. Lovely blackberry flavors and black pepper make for a very balanced bottling that doesn't rely on bombastic power to tell the Syrah story.
US,86.0,36.0,Southern Oregon,Season,"The winery calls this a Super-Tuscan blend, though the inclusion of 38% CarmenÃ¨re might have some Italian vintners scratching their heads. The rest is mostly Sangiovese, with bits of Syrah and Cabernet as well. Juicy citrus and purple berries, some pomegranate and dark chocolate can be found, along with the green bean, stemmy flavors of CarmenÃ¨re."
US,86.0,13.0,Monterey County,Hess Select,"A little oak, brisk acidity and good flavors of lemons, limes and mangoes mark this dry, stylishly creamy wine that's fine for drinking now, at a good price."
France,89.0,19.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Saint-Sernin,"A period of wood aging has rounded out the fruit in this rich wine. It has a dusty, soft structure, offering sweet juiciness to go with the toast and spice element. The final flavors are of berry acidity."
US,90.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Carlisle,"This is a good deal for wine of this quality. Shy on the nose at first, it soon opens into a bevy of thick, meaty, smooth and rugged expression, dotted in a landscape of chocolate and bacon. Grippy tannin give way to more chocolate and welcome dots of white pepper."
Spain,83.0,16.0,Alicante,Bocopa,"Grassy aromas mark the nose. This is foamy and awkward on the palte, with briny apricot, lychee and papaya flavors finish."
US,91.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Brian Carter Cellars,"This wine is a blend of Tempranillo (63%), Graciano (26%) and Garnacha. Appealing aromas of red fruit, spice, cocoa and toasty barrel accents give way to fruit and barrel flavors brightened by tart acidity and supported by lightly grainy tannins. It's an intriguing blend of these varieties that shows impeccable balance and impressive length."
US,91.0,26.0,Monterey,Joullian,"Tropical scents of guava and cherimoya with the mineral edge of concrete lead the aromatics on this Carmel Valley wine. Sharp acidity at first sip massages into softness soon afterward, upholding the nose's rocky promise as well as delivering lime-zest tang throughout."
US,95.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Cordant,"Winemaker Tyler Russell sources the fruit for this bottling from an extremely cool-climate vineyard. Tons of fresh-pressed boysenberries meet with wood ash, underripe berries, black olives, rosemary, roasted lamb and Mediterranean spices on the nose. Tart black-plum skin is layered with bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, crushed peppercorn and charred beef on the dynamic palate."
US,91.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sinclair Estate Vineyards,"Very much in line with SEV's fine 2009 Chardonnay, this is sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. Instantly round and fruity, it offers up a ripe mix of oranges and apricots, backed with juicy acidity. Then it brings in the butter, toast and nuts?a full-bodied, extremely generous wine."
Argentina,84.0,8.0,Mendoza,Conquista de Argentina,"This mildly prickly, red-fruit dominated Malbec is perfectly drinkable. The nose is drying, while the palate shows red cherries and raspberry along with some forceful buttery oak. Reasonably long on the finish."
France,87.0,20.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau de Bel,This is a ripe wine and full of fruit. It has structure as well with its firm tannins and smoky backdrop. It will broaden out well and give a rich wine from 2018.
US,87.0,26.0,Dry Creek Valley,Unti,"With ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, the fruit of this dry wine stands out, making it enjoyable despite very tough tannins that currently make it astringently sandpapery. A good effort, although the challenge for Unti is to tame those fierce tannins."
France,87.0,18.0,Cheverny,BenoÃ®t Daridan,"The magnificent chateau of Cheverny is a fitting focal point for the wines of this small appellation. This wine is light in color, young and fruity. Soft tannins and red berry fruits are rounded and easy to drink. The wine is ready to enjoy although it could age through 2017."
US,88.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of smoke, herb, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to medium-bodied, supple fruit flavors. It doesn't all seem to come together at present, with the wood seeming primary."
France,95.0,475.0,Mazoyeres-Chambertin,Domaine Perrot-Minot,"The small MazoyÃ¨res-Chambertin Grand Cru creates structured wines with plenty of texture and tannins. This is brooding, firm and very concentrated, with its fruit set way behind the dark tannins and spice note. It will take at least 10 years to start to mature."
Italy,87.0,29.0,Marche,Il Conte,"Very thick and syrupy, this is a sticky wine with thick concentration and vegetal notes of green spice, blackberry and milled peppercorn. It's dense, rich and succulent with chewy tannins on the close."
US,91.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Beauregard,"Very heady and earthy aromas of cedar, tobacco leaf, smoked cigar and the hint of ancho chile show on the nose this unique, cool-climate take on Merlot. The palate is quite woodsy with cedar and pine but also jammy with red fruit, bolstered by bitter dark chocolate and dried chile pepper."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Baccinetti,"This opens with aromas of toast, prune, scorched earth and chopped mint. The juicy palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and a hint of sweet baking spice alongside supple tannins. Straightforward and already approachable, it will offer enjoyable sipping in the near term. Drink through 2020."
US,93.0,37.0,Rockpile,Mauritson,"A fabulous Petite Sirah for serious fans of the variety. Shows typically big tannins and high alcohol, with full-bodied, concentrated mountain flavors of blackberries, currants, roasted meat and pepper. Best of all is the balance of its parts, resulting in elegance despite the power."
France,88.0,11.0,Alsace,Hubert Meyer,"This is crisp, tight, still young. Hedgerow flower aromas are sustained in the fresh character of the wine. Zesty lemon shines while the steely, tight texture is still closed and waiting to blossom. Drink from 2015."
US,89.0,27.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ott & Murphy,"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine brings aromas of dark fruit, iron and coffee. The fruit flavors are sweet and well proportioned, pulling up toward the finish."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Ca' Momi,"A bit simple, but fruity and pleasant, with pineapple, vanilla, honeysuckle, peach, apricot and spice flavors. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and GewÃ¼rztraminer."
US,91.0,40.0,Livermore Valley,Rubino Estates Winery,"This well-balanced wine tastes more nimble than the huge bottle it comes in. The wine has oak and balsam aromas, fresh raspberry and cherry flavors, full body and just-right moderate tannins for good grip on the palate. This is a great example of a high-alcohol wine that doesn't taste extreme and is very enjoyable."
US,93.0,38.0,Dry Creek Valley,Francis Coppola,"White and black pepper jump out of the glass, calling to the senses in this wine from the Wallace Creek Vineyard. A complex tangle of body and texture interweaves between an underlying elegance that belies the considerable ripeness behind this wine."
Argentina,85.0,19.0,Mendoza,Finca Agostino,"Exotic aromas of dusty blueberry, latex and campfire set up a jammy, somewhat clumsy feeling palate with big, candied flavors of baked berry blended with sweet oak and licorice. The finish tastes minty, chocolaty and oaky, with heat."
US,87.0,15.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Crest,"Light aromas of baking spice, vanilla and red fruit lead to well-balanced red-fruit and barrel flavors that taper toward the finish, with coffee flavors lingering."
US,86.0,13.0,Livermore Valley,Wente,"A fairly rich Chard whose creamy texture holds fruit-forward, smoky flavors of baked apples, grilled pineapples, vanilla, butterscotch, and dusty Asian spices. Drink now."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Lazio,Principe Pallavicini,"Made from old vines of Cesanese, this structured red offers an intriguing fragrance of violets, rose, red berry, scorched earth and a whiff of nutmeg. The bright, juicy palate delivers wild cherry, orange peel, clove and baking spice alongside supple, smooth tannins."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Etna,Cantine Russo,"A blend of 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Nerello Cappuccio, this medium-bodied red has aromas of wild berry, mocha, cake spice and a whiff of toast. The straightforward, easygoing palate offers wild cherry and star anise alongside fine-grained, rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018."
US,85.0,27.0,Virginia,Veramar,"Red currant, red plum, licorice and dried herbs are pronounced on the nose. The palate is tart and slightly medicinal in character, with charred oak and spice coming through as well."
US,91.0,39.0,Sonoma Coast,Waxwing,"From the cooler reaches of the Petaluma Gap, a sub-area of the larger Sonoma Coast that is awaiting its own appellation status, this Pinot was made with 25% whole-cluster berries, giving it a rough-hewn, earthy edginess that's appealing in the glass. Tightly wound cherry and cranberry complete the picture, with a taste of dried herb and black tea on the lengthy finish."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Alto Adige,Erste Neue,"Subtle aromas of dark berry, tilled earth and baking spice lead the nose. The ripe, juicy palate doles out mature plum, cassis, anise and black pepper alongside round, solid tannins. Drink through 2018."
Argentina,90.0,36.0,Tupungato,Riglos,"Full but fresh blackberry and plum aromas show a note of tea before turning a touch grassy. Chewy and full on the palate, this is leafy and herbal tasting, with blackberry and pepper notes. A spicy, chocolaty, lightly leafy finish seems right for Cabernet Franc; drink through 2021."
France,93.0,35.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Picque Caillou,"The estate is within the urban area of Bordeaux, an oasis of green in the busy city. It is a smooth, rich wine that has benefited from the consultancy work of the late Denis Dubourdieu. Ripe tannins and fine acidity support the black currant and plum fruits. The wine is developing well. Drink from 2020."
Argentina,88.0,15.0,Mendoza,TamarÃ­,"Dry earthy aromas of herbal raspberry and tomato are reserved in a good way. There's acidic lift to a rugged palate, while berry fruit flavors blend with spice notes prior to a tannic finish."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Navarra,Otazu,"Apple aromas come with a mild but noticeable burn. This feels dense and thick, with creaminess to the palate. Flavors of pear, melon and banana slow down and thicken up on the finish, which is round and not at all complex."
Spain,86.0,12.0,Navarra,Ochoa,"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel. But it's only Viura and Chardonnay, and it tastes fresh, floral and nice, with lime and lychee. About as easy as they come."
France,90.0,80.0,Pommard,Albert Bichot,"With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019."
US,85.0,25.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Paraiso Vineyards,"A solid, everyday Pinot that shows flavors of cherries, root beer, oranges, anise, mint and peppery spices. Feels silky and crisp in the mouth. It's a little rough, but will support a wide assortment of foods."
France,86.0,13.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau de Perligues,Light wood aging sets the scene for this crisp and herbaceous wine. Citrus fruits give a juicy character and contrast with the mineral texture coming from the stony vineyard. It's a fresh wine to drink now.
US,89.0,16.0,Central Coast,Sextant,"The nose on this estate wine emerges slowly with enough sniffing, offering white peach, white flowers and honeydew. It's a fruit salad of flavors once sipped, suggesting melons and apples tossed in citrus vinaigrette."
US,89.0,26.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Roark Wine Co.,"Fresh nectarine, wet stone, cider apple and cut grass notes show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are rounded, with Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and citrus touches, upright tannins and prominent malic acids."
France,95.0,115.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,Domaine de Chevalier,"An impeccable wine, this is so finely balanced between its rich fruits and structure. With its seamless character, it offers both fine acidity, green and white fruit and an undertow of wood aging. This is a wine for long-term aging."
France,88.0,20.0,Lussac Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau de Tabuteau,"Owned by the same family since 1850, this estate has produced a ripe Merlot-dominated wine. It is densely structured and full of black-currant fruits. The crisp fruitiness of the year shows strongly. Drink from 2018."
France,93.0,27.0,Alsace,ClÃ©ment Klur,"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and GewÃ¼rztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025."
US,83.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Prager,"Not too many Port-style wines are made from Chardonnay, as this one is. The residual sugar is 6%, but it's not a very good wine. Tastes cooked or stewed in pineapple, and the high alcohol makes for a burnt feeling."
US,88.0,12.0,California,Avalon,"Very fruity, fresh and easy to enjoy, this has the smoothness of barrel age but little overt oak flavor. It features bright red cherry and raspberry aromas, juicy berry flavors and a texture with just enough bite to be appetizing."
France,91.0,26.0,Morgon,ChÃ¢teau de Pizay,"From the famous Morgon hillside of CÃ´te de Py, this is a firm and structured wine. It shows the aging possibility of a Beaujolais, rich and full of firm tannins that come straight from the granite soil. The wine will develop well, packed with dark plum fruit that has a great shot of acidity. Drink from 2017."
France,86.0,17.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Larteau,"A ripe, full wine that has almost too much weight, it offers a very rich texture and firm tannins. The blackberry jelly fruits are dense and powered by a fruity feel. Drink from 2016."
US,84.0,25.0,Red Hills Lake County,La Famiglia,"Tasting like there's some residual sugar, this Barbera from Lake County's mountains seems off-dry, with jammy black raspberry and vanilla confection flavors. It's quite a good wine, with enough acidity to brace it, but it's not dry."
US,93.0,145.0,Oakville,Tierra Roja,"Plummy in dark chocolate, cedar and coffee, this well-structured, 100% varietal wine offers much to enjoy and admire. Exuberantly fruity, with polished, integrated tannins, it's rich and full bodied, finishing with the unexpected elegance of delicate clove and toffee notes."
US,92.0,37.0,Napa Valley,Ravenswood,"This is a lovely vineyard-designate, brawny and bold and completely floral. Brambly blackberry is met by plum and raisin as a leathery texture provides grit and brawn. Spicy black pepper and cinnamon season the finish."
France,86.0,15.0,Minervois,L'Ostal Cazes,"This blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Carignan and 20% Grenache opens with pleasant but soft scents of herbed cherry, plum and violet. The palate is light and easy, with soft tannins and juicy red-fruit flavors that finish clean and bright. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,43.0,Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze,Col Vetoraz,"Aromas of honeysuckle and exotic fruit lead the way. The aromas flow over to the rather sweet supple palate along with mature white peach, candied lemon peel and a confectionery note. A soft mousse backs up the rich flavors."
France,86.0,12.0,Touraine,Marquis de Goulaine,"With its crisp red-currant fruits and strongly herbal character, this is a ripe wine with intense acidity. It is crisply textured and concentrated. Drink now."
US,90.0,39.0,Livermore Valley,McGrail,"Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017."
France,87.0,14.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau l'Escadre,"A perfumed fruity wine, this has a light structure along with its forward red fruits. Acidity and juicy fruitiness complete this attractive, ready to drink wine."
US,85.0,29.0,Oregon,Merrill Cellars,"The mouthfeel is flat and the flavors generic, despite the reserve designation. Light cranberry and pomegranate fruits are set against strongly herbal and earthy components."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Barbaresco,Cascina Morassino,"Balsamic aromas, leather, truffle, soil and ripe berry scents take center stage. The chewy, structured palate offers succulent Morello cherry, fleshy raspberry and cake spice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A star anise note closes the finish. Drink 2018??025."
US,95.0,125.0,Spring Mountain District,Barnett,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now??017."
US,91.0,26.0,Central Coast,Coquelicot,"The nose on this bottling leans a bit sweet yet remains zesty, with ripe apples, pears, lime sorbet and lemon-lime soda. But the sip is racy and sizzling with buoyant acidity, delivering tightly wound Bosc pear and Gravenstein apple flavors doused with citrus spray."
US,94.0,48.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Elizabeth Chambers,"This young winery continues to impress. This deep, dark, concentrated wine builds upon black cherry, vivid acids, a touch of Meyer lemon, and a powerful midpalate that unveils some gently savory notes along the way. The extended, seamless finish brings a pleasing touch of baking spices."
US,93.0,47.0,Russian River Valley,Longboard,"A tremendous Syrah, so rich and tasty, it makes you wonder why more people don't drink this variety. Shows intense, explosive blackberry, currant, bacon and black pepper flavors, with a savory hint of raisins. New oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dramatic and lush, this single-vineyard Syrah will provide good drinking over the next four years."
US,87.0,26.0,Santa Barbara County,Palmina,"Steve Clifton makes this wine pop with a wet river-stone minerality on the fresh olallieberry fruit-laden nose. The palate offers spiced plums, a bit of blood and turned-earth flavors."
France,88.0,30.0,Vin Mousseux,Couly-Dutheil,"A richer version of a Saumur sparkling wine, this is soft, ripe and creamy. The dosage feels on the sweet side, although it is labeled Brut. There is just a touch of fruit skin texture to give it a firm edge, but there is also great final acidity."
Canada,93.0,35.0,Okanagan Valley,Le Vieux Pin,"A brilliant blend of 61% Viognier, 21% Roussanne and 18% Marsanne, this impresses with its proportion, tension and balance. Scents and flavors meld citrus oil and rind, fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon, and a lovely finish with highlights of English breakfast tea. Long and elegant, this is a landmark effort."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Rioja,Bodegas OntaÃ±Ã³n,"Vanilla, popcorn and baked apple aromas create a good but one-dimensional nose. In the mouth, things run tight and acidic, with a puckering, lemony feel and austere flavors of dry apple and spice. Finishes tangy and lemony."
US,86.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,This pale pink colored wine offers appealing aromas of watermelon Jolly Rancher and cherry. It drinks off dry with mouthwatering cherry flavors.
US,91.0,55.0,Red Mountain,Fidelitas,"From a vineyard sited near the winery, this is the most supple, balanced and evenly detailed of the 2007 red wines from FidÃ©litas. The lightly muscled, compact fruit flavors bring black cherry, cassis, and plum together, with a strong minerality providing subtext. A suggestion of smoke suffuses the finish."
US,91.0,45.0,Paso Robles,EOS,"If you prefer your California Chards on the minerally side instead of the flamboyant, superripe style, try this one. With its stony or metallic and citrus-inspired flavors and extreme dryness at low alcohol, it can be described as Chablisian. Hard to believe the oak is 100% new, as it doesn't taste oaky despite the streamlined profile."
US,85.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,"This is a rather light wine in both density, flavor and impact. Some dilute citrus fruit flavors are framed with the lightest hint of cracker. Drink it chilled or use it as a mixer."
US,88.0,17.0,Sonoma County,Sebastiani,"A well-priced, higher production Zin with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Malbec and Alicante Bouschet, this features plenty of ripe black and red berry fruit leveled by restrained, dusty tannins. Smooth and well crafted, it makes for a good house wine."
Spain,89.0,27.0,Toro,Cyan,"Sweet on the nose but also a little green, with minty aromas of herb mixed with blueberry. It feels typically tannic and tough, with roasted blackberry and chocolate flavors. The finish is tannic, with spicy, chocolaty flavors that last for quite a while. Drink now. USA Wine West."
France,92.0,30.0,ArdÃ¨che,Chateau Les Amoureuses,"Another tiny cuvÃ©e from Amoureuses (80 cases produced), this one blends 40% Syrah, 35% Grenache and 25% Merlot. Toasted-coconut oak scents lead the way, followed by oodles of black plums and cherries, a splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. It's full bodied and velvety textured; rich, like dessert without sugar. Drink now??025."
Argentina,89.0,30.0,Mendoza,Siesta,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced."
US,91.0,42.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Kessler-Haak,"One of Dan Kessler's many Pinot bottlings, this shows tart but deep black plum skin aromas, with boysenberry, lavender, hibiscus and a touch of candied cherry. The palate shows both red cherry ripeness and fresh pomegranate tang, with a focus on floral elements of lavender and rose, presented like a bouquet on the tongue."
US,90.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Jarvis,"A very pretty wine, dry and delicious in cherry pie filling, cocoa, spice and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are just perfect, rich and soft, providing a velvety texture to the richness. Cabernet Sauvignon constitutes 11% of the blend, but the wine still shows that Cabernet Franc, by itself or almost nearly, needs something more to give it extra oomph."
US,90.0,41.0,Santa Maria Valley,Testarossa,"Rich and creamy in pineapple, orange and lime fruit, with a sweet coating of new oak, this Chardonnay is balanced with zesty acidity. It's an opulent, flashy wine."
US,89.0,35.0,Monticello,King Family,"Tiers of aromas and flavors in this expressive wine reveal themselves like a Matryoshka doll. Wafts of dried apricot and chamomile open into tangerine peel and marmalade, then finally marzipan and ginger come forth on the nose. Concentrated flavors mimic the aromas and introduce fresh vanilla bean and hay. Racy acidity thrills, while two years in neutral French oak keeps the wine round and full-bodied. The finish is long and compelling."
US,86.0,35.0,Cayuga Lake,Treleaven,"Notes of dried fig, citrus rind and tangerines are spiked with whiffs of potpourri and spice on this richly textured, unctuously sweet iced wine made from late-harvest grapes frozen after harvest. Creamy and lush on the finish, it's brightened by a shower of orange acidity and just a hint of black-tea astringency."
Australia,84.0,17.0,Yarra Valley,Greg Norman Estates,"The lime, pear and melon aromas and flavors are garnished with just a touch of vanilla. Picks up some vegetal lima bean notes on the palate, and the acids stick out a bit on the finish. Still, it's crisp and clean?and would go down easy after a hot round of golf."
Italy,85.0,10.0,Sicilia,MandraRossa,"MandraRossa's well-priced Fiano  offers Golden Delicious apple, banana and almond skin. The wine has a candy-like quality overall, but it's also genuine and simple with an easy approach."
US,88.0,15.0,Dry Creek Valley,Quivira,"Entirely stainless-steel fermented and aged, this wine offers a tremendously fair deal. Peach and apricot form the core of this light, subtle white that has a solid backbone of acidity and is finished in a taste of lemon verbena."
US,97.0,150.0,Napa Valley,Harlan Estate,"Massive, decadent. Opens with extraordinary aromas of cedar, black currants, cherries, chocolate, sage, pepper and anise, with hints of roasted game. Feels very round, smooth but powerful. Almost sweet in red and black currants and chocolate. So refined, absolutely delicious. Beautiful, lush, complex, soft. Should age."
US,90.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sineann,"If anyone can perfectly evoke the ripe style of California Cabernet along with the structure of Washington state fruit, it's Peter Rosback of Sineann ??conveniently located in Oregon. Why this iconoclastic winemaker does not just move to Washington is hard to figure; he obviously loves the grapes and knows exactly what to do with them. This Cabernet Sauvignon, from a relatively young block at the Champoux vineyard, has some heat and chewy tannins. But it should age well, and the tightly wound herb and tobacco and stone flavors that are now constrained will ultimately come out."
US,90.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Bynum,"Exotic in orange blossom and jasmine scents, this wine presents as full bodied, brawny and rich, showing a touch of oak reduction on the palate. Within that framework, hints of lemon and grapefruit keep it feeling fresh."
US,95.0,75.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Dragonette,"There are excellent savory qualities to this bottling, with white pepper, charred lamb, soy and pine resin adding much intrigue to the black currant fruit. The umami character is strong on the sip, with beef jerky, black pepper and wild mushroom broth flavors, but there is also some tangy fruit as well as upright tannins that will keep this wine singing for years. Drink now??028."
France,85.0,70.0,Champagne,Taittinger,"A soft style, indicating a higher dosage, that produces simple fruits but also a level of bitterness. The wine is a disappointment from such a famous name."
US,91.0,125.0,Rutherford,Flora Springs,"From a tiny hillside block in Rutherford, this 100% Cab is soft in clove, black currant and olive, juicy yet restrained. It spent almost two years in 90% new French oak, but the presence of oak is subtle and the tannins well-managed, making the wine both enjoyable now and worth cellaring through 2020."
US,89.0,16.0,El Dorado,Boeger,"Crisp and bright in flavor like Pippin apples, this wine is light bodied, braced by good acidity and has a refreshing cleansing effect on the palate. With more character than many similar wines, it's worth seeking out."
US,91.0,45.0,Oregon,BlackCap,"Beginning to round out its youthful edges, the BlackCap (so named for the native Oregon mushroom, berry and bird) offers pretty pie-cherry fruit, savory herbs and silky tannins. There's still some phenolic bite to the finish, suggesting that it can continue to smooth out over the next few years."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Barbaresco,Rivetto,"Fresh red rose, blue flower, bright red berry and baking spices lead the nose on this structured wine. The palate delivers juicy red cherry, cinnamon and white pepper alongside notes of mint and balsamic herbs. It's a bit austere with bracing tannins that need time to soften. Drink after 2017."
US,90.0,55.0,Willamette Valley,Rex Hill,"The vineyard is located in the Dundee Hills AVA (not shown on the label). There's a metallic edge to the flavors, starting with the nose and continuing on through the palate. Peppery black fruits are at the core, showing a rather hard edge at the moment. This might need a bit of extra aeration or cellar time to show its best."
US,92.0,62.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Barton,"Dark and velvety on the nose, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Cabernet Franc and 10% Malbec offers a plump but balanced expression of black cherry, black pepper and dried herbs. The complex palate combines exotic plum and dried strawberry with mocha and crumbled mint flavors."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Taurasi,Pietracupa,"Aromas of blue flower, mature black fruit, underbrush and subtle oak lead the nose of this Taurasi. The palate offers solid tannins and flavors of mature plum, stewed prune and plum cake, accented by a hint of allspice."
France,93.0,224.0,Gevrey-Chambertin,Domaine Dujac,"All the proper structure of young Gevrey-Chambertin with the addition of rich, generous fruit. The core is of wood and dry fruit tannins, the fruit of rich black plum juice. At this stage, the wine is firm. Give it 5?? years to open up."
US,91.0,35.0,Southern Oregon,Abacela,"Abacela's tenth vintage of Tempranillo suggests it's time to call the ?experiment??a success. It's savory and scented with cured meats; a spicy red that marries black currant fruit to pepper and more exotic spices?curry, cumin and five spice. Tannins are tongue-scrapingly dry, but is there a better match for a thick steak?"
Italy,90.0,55.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Colutta,"Packaged in a long, elegant bottle with a wax seal, this precious Picolit dessert wine offers aromas of stone fruit, apricot, dried mint, orange zest and ginger. It shows pretty complexity and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel."
US,82.0,11.0,Yakima Valley,Hoodsport,"Opens with watery, citrusy aromas, and tastes of apples and grapefruits. Not much complexity or depth, but it's clean, with no flaws. On the soft side, and finishes with a little residual sugar."
US,88.0,36.0,Red Mountain,Tapteil Vineyard,"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this Merlot is medium bodied, and it has a mix of red fruit flavors, plus grace notes of leaf and mushroom. The finish leaves an impression of dried toast."
France,90.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Rousset-Caillau,"A smooth, ripe wine that has rich fruit and balanced wood and fruit tannins. With mint flavors and a generous blackberry flavor, the wine is firm, with fine aging potential. It is a full-bodied wine that will be ready to drink from 2019."
US,87.0,32.0,Edna Valley,Tolosa,"A bit light and tight on the nose, this shows condensed strawberries and dried beef aromas before diving into a palate of purple berries. It's an easy-drinking, well-made wine for everyday sipping, just not showing much extra pop."
US,85.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,River Rock,"This is a little raw and acidic in texture, with a trace of underripeness. But it passes the basic Pinot test, boasting a silky texture and good raspberry and cherry flavors."
France,86.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,FranÃ§ois Lurton,"A fresh, lightly honeyed blend of Gros Manseng and Sauvignon Blanc, this is a fragrant, fruity wine with a twist of lemon and herbaceous acidity. It is light, touched by yellow fruits and with an orange tang at the end."
US,89.0,24.0,Yakima Valley,Bunnell,"This wine is a blend Viognier (60%) and Roussanne. Aromas of almond butter, lees and spice are followed by a broad palate with a creamy feel. The finish lingers."
France,93.0,22.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Domaine de l'Ecu,"Like all the wines from this domaine, this comes from biodynamically produced grapes. It is part of a series of wines named after the subsoil in which the vines are planted. The wine is tense, mineral and still young. It has a flinty character along with lemon and grapefruit fruit. There is a salty tang to this wine that really needs to age. Drink from late 2017."
US,90.0,15.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Redhawk,"This is a good, rich, leesy and immediately appealing wine, with great texture and a fine mix of melon, apricot and peach flavors. For the price, it's hard to find a better Pinot Gris."
Spain,86.0,16.0,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,?nima Negra,"This funky white from the island of Mallorca is 50% Premsal and 50% Callet, and if you've never heard of those grapes you're not alone. The nose is a bit harsh and strange, while the palate is on the flat side. Flavors of ham, pithy citrus and nectarine finish jumbled. This is more of a unique oddity than great white wine."
US,83.0,20.0,Santa Clara Valley,Jason-Stephens,"Closed aromatically, this Chardonnay has a lemon-lime crispness that follows straight into vanilla and toasty oak. Young, it finishes on a sour note."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,"Sweet and jammy fruit flavors suggest canned cherry and plum. That sweetness is offset by the drying, earthy tannins and flavor of dried herb."
US,91.0,35.0,Anderson Valley,Betwixt,"This wine is particularly lively and well-balanced, with a relatively light color, bright red-cherry aromas and tangy cranberry flavors that open up to riper plum and maple accents. It's medium-bodied, moderately tannic and especially vivid in acidity."
US,87.0,18.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Foundry Vineyards,"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this brings sweet cherry flavors to the forefront, albeit with some noticeable volatility. You can taste it in the slightly vinegary finish; but that said, it's a perfectly pleasant wine with enough fruit to carry it for a couple more years."
Australia,99.0,850.0,South Australia,Penfolds,"This inky, embryonic wine deserves to be cellared until at least 2025 and should drink well for at least 25 years after that. It takes its time opening up in the glass to reveal notes of grilled meat, vanilla and plum. In the mouth, it's full bodied and firmly built, with a wall of chewy tannins surrounding a deep ripe core."
Spain,84.0,23.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Pazo de Barrantes,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled."
US,87.0,25.0,Alexander Valley,Chateau St. Jean,"Almost a repeat of the ??5, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding."
France,88.0,20.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Bibian,"This wine is dry, full of tannins that mask the fruit and give the wine an austere character that will need time to soften out. The aftertaste contines the dry theme, but with hints of a more fruity future. Drink from 2018 when the fruit will have asserted itself."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Alto Adige,Muri-Gries,"Here's a bright, fresh and aromatic wine from northern Italy that offers aromas of honeysuckle, peach blossom and grapefruit. It's compact and clean with a fresh point of citrus on the close."
US,86.0,10.0,California,Trim,"Made mostly from Mendocino County fruit, this is a really good value in a Cabernet. It's dry, tart and grippy in tannins, and savory in blackberry, blueberry, espresso and cedar flavors."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Bolla,"This offers vibrant aromas of red cherry, blackberry, leather, spice and cigar box. There are dark touches of resin and brown sugar that are followed by notes of smoked bacon and cured meat. This is dark, masculine and concentrated."
France,92.0,12.0,Madiran,ChÃ¢teau d'Aydie,"A rich wine in which the firm Tannat character dominates, giving great character, black plum flavors, a dense structure and generous tannins. All these join in a wine that's as much about elegance as power. Drink from 2017."
US,92.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Helix by Reininger,"Yummy is the first word that comes to mind, followed by sounds of lip smacking. It's a rich bundle of extracted cherry and raspberry fruit, driven deep with juicy acidity, and bound with ripe tannins. The penetration and vivid tartness are remarkable, and supremely satisfying."
France,88.0,40.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Magnan-Figeac,"From one of three estates owned by the Moreaud family in one contiguous 61-acre property, this smooth and ripe wine is all about rich black fruits. Supported by just the right amount of tannin and acidity, it is already delicious and fruity. Drink now, but better to wait until the end of 2016."
US,92.0,85.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reynvaan Family Vineyards,"Blended with 6% Marsanne, the aromas are light (considering the appellation and producer), bringing notes of herb, smoked meat, white pepper, mineral and earth. The flavors are tart and bright, creating a real sense of freshness and vibrancy."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Progettidivini,"This opens with a drying bouquet of white flower, peach, talcum powder and crushed mineral. A small percent of Pinot Bianco is added to the wine for extra smoothness and structure."
France,90.0,20.0,JuliÃ©nas,Georges Duboeuf,"This cru estate is owned by the Duboeuf family. The wine has some wood aging that adds to the rich texture while not detracting from the ripe juicy red-cherry fruit. With its tannins, the wine could age, so drink from late 2017."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Tre Donne,"Made by the three Lequio sisters, Donna Rossa Dolcetto delivers a traditional and linear style with good intensity and a fair level of complexity. There are loads of spice and fresh fruit aromas here and the wine is capped by some sour cherry flavors."
US,91.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Mira,"Rich and thick in leathery blueberry, this Syrah from the great Carneros-based Hyde Vineyard is a study in full-bodied black licorice and dark chocolate caramel. Though bigger in style, it retains acidity and balance."
US,86.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Zero One Vintners,"This wine is mostly Merlot (77%), fleshed out by Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Petit Verdot. Fresh aromas of plum, herb, bittersweet chocolate and red fruit are followed by medium-bodied, lightly sweet fruit flavors. The tannins bring some grit and it shows some heat on the finish."
US,90.0,35.0,Dry Creek Valley,Ravenswood,"Dry and rugged in tannins, this Zin displays a complex array of wild berry, tobacco, cocoa and dusty Asian spice flavors. It's a little heavy in liqueur-type softness. Calls for barbecue, grilled beef, or even dark chocolate."
France,95.0,350.0,Clos de Vougeot,ChÃ¢teau de la Tour,"Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024."
US,87.0,22.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"Rich and ripe, with tasty lime, strawberrry and yeast flavors that finish sweet and spicy. The bubbles are a bit clunky, but otherwise it's a nice brut."
Australia,87.0,11.0,South Eastern Australia,McWilliam's Hanwood Estate,"A good value in easy-to-drink Cabernet, McWilliam's 2008 is plummy and chocolaty, with soft tannins and a velvety finish. A bit simple perhaps, but definitely satisfying. Drink now."
France,88.0,26.0,Gigondas,Andrieux & Fils,"This is a very drinkable Gigondas despite being very much in the savory-spicy style. Leather, garrigue, cinnamon and clove are the dominant notes, softened by silky tannins and modest cherry fruit. Drink now??015."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Barolo,Revello Fratelli,"This opens with aromas suggesting espresso, oak and coconut while the palate shows black raspberry, dried cherry, toast, clove and licorice. Give the tightly wound tannins a few years to unwind then enjoy."
Australia,87.0,17.0,Barossa Valley,Craneford,"Boasts tremendously ripe fruit?the stated alcohol level is 15.5%?yet doesn't seem overly hot or bulky. As you might expect, the tannins are soft, while the flavors of cassis pick up hints of cola, earth and tobacco. Despite the ripeness, there's a streak of tangy acidity that holds everything together. Drink now."
US,91.0,47.0,Suisun Valley,Forlorn Hope,"This is an inky dark, broodingly tannic, bone-dry wine. Also an expensive one. Is it worth it? If you're a Petite Sirah fan, it's one of the most exciting of the genre you can buy. The flavors are a complex melange of blackberries, cherries, plums, mocha and dusty spices. This is in serious need of cellaring. Best after 2008, and for a decade afterward."
France,91.0,80.0,Champagne,Chassenay d'Arce,"It's rare to find Pinot Blanc in Champagne, let alone as a stand-alone grape. From the southern Aube vineyards, it's fruitier and softer than a Chardonnay-based wine. That makes it accessible, smooth, creamy and just ready to drink."
US,90.0,65.0,Paso Robles,Falcone,"Falcone's fourth release of this non-vintage blend solidifies its placement as a fine, complex wine to drink over the next several years. Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the softness and richness of a Paso red, with flavors of black cherry jam, chocolate, roasted coconut and black pepper."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Bolgheri,Casa di Terra,"This wine opens with aromas of forest berry, sour cherry and white almond. The finish is tangy, fruity and fresh, with bright acidity and crisp fruit."
Spain,87.0,17.0,Rioja,Casado Morales,"This Tempranillo is electric purple in color, with aromas of rubber, horse hide and grapy berry. It's round and jammy feeling, with tannic grip and jammy flavors of baked, earthy berry fruits, followed by a savory, meaty, roasted tasting finish."
US,85.0,22.0,North Fork of Long Island,Diliberto,"Layers of wood and bramble juxtapose flavors of pressed apple, pear and lemon here. While its light-bodied style and brisk acidity are refreshing, it finishes on slightly bitter tones of sap and resin. Drink now through 2019."
US,84.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Six Mile Creek,"While savory on the nose with pungent whiffs of smoke and dried herb, this full-bodied Chardonnay is surprisingly forward with ripe, sunny peach and apricot flavors. Straightforward in style yet juicy and enjoyable."
France,86.0,13.0,Vin Mousseux,Bouvet-Ladubay,"Bouvet Ladubay's rosÃ© is a soft in style with a light fruit flavor dominated by fresh raspberries. There's also a touch of tannin in the texture, resulting in a sparkling wine that is more for food than an aperitif."
US,90.0,22.0,Sonoma County-Monterey County-Santa Barbara County,Meiomi,"An unabashedly rich and luscious wine, this combines ripe and fresh fruit flavors with luxurious spicy, buttery accents and an almost thick texture. With a subtext as savory as Udon broth it's practically a meal in a bottle. Call it full-bodied, full-flavored, ultrasmooth and impressive."
US,87.0,32.0,Santa Barbara County,Addamo,"Superripe in blackberry, red plum, cherry, mocha, fig and caramel flavors, this wine certainly scores high on the deliciousness factor. It could use greater structural depth and complexity but is good overall."
Italy,96.0,70.0,Barolo,Schiavenza,"Underbrush, saddle leather, dark berry and culinary spice aromas slowly unfold in the glass. Succulent and full bodied, the firmly structured palate delivers raspberry compote, ripe Marasca cherry, baking spice and pipe tobacco framed in youthfully assertive but noble tannins and bright acidity. A savory mineral note lingers on the finish. This is one for the long haul. Drink 2025??053."
US,86.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Novy,"A 100% Viognier that's heady in ripe pit fruit, mostly sweet peach, and accented in nutty, floral aromas. It's full-bodied and  robust, with tannins that are soft and juicy."
US,89.0,85.0,Sonoma Coast,Del Dotto,"A rich effort, this offers ripe pear, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Interesting notes of mushrooms and dried fruits are beginning to emerge, although that might indicate the wine's limited ageability. Drink over the next 1?? years."
Italy,85.0,55.0,Venezia Giulia,Jermann,"This barrique-aged Chardonnay tastes a bit too much of barrique, with toasty, cinnamon and vanilla flavors dominating the underlying melon and peach fruit. It's sexy wood, but it's just too prominent; tone down the makeup and let this beauty's natural good looks shine through."
US,88.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear."
US,85.0,26.0,Central Coast,Kendall-Jackson,"Root beer and slate show on the very restrained nose of this wine that combines fruit from Monterey County (66%) and Santa Barbara Counry (34%). The palate is light and slightly metallic, with iron as well as eucalyptus and shreds of cranberry and raspberry fruit."
US,86.0,20.0,Paso Robles,San Simeon,"The aromas on this wine are a bit weak, showing hints of licorice and a touch of blueberry. The palate offers dark red to purple fruit, with a touch of more bitter coffee grinds. The tannins are squeaky in texture."
France,89.0,15.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau ClÃ©ment Saint-Jean,"Dark and extracted, this has firm, dry tannins. It's hard edged, but the potential of the black currant fruit is apparent. Give this structured wine at least five years for the rich fruit to surface."
Italy,86.0,9.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Farnese,"This is a terrific wine to pair with pizza or a heaping plate of spaghetti and meat sauce. Informal, bright and fruity, this Montepulciano d'Abruzzo delivers clean blackberry aromas and an easy but sufficiently extracted finish."
US,94.0,65.0,Napa Valley,M. Cosentino,"Forward aromas of ripe cherries and deep vanillin oak meld nicely. Black plum, sweet cherry and coffee flavors, with cedar accents. The very full, supple mouthfeel is captivating. Shows fine length, spicy dry tannins and the stuffing to last. Hold four or more years, as it will keep for ages."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Salento,Masseria Altemura,"Smoky cola and plum flavors feature some intriguingly briary notes, but also veer toward prune and cooked fruit. Tannins are soft, but the wine is surprisingly tart on the finish. With its crisp acidity, expect it to pair well with tomato-based sauces."
France,84.0,11.0,Pays d'Oc,Villa des Anges,"An easy and bright selection, this offers direct aromas and flavors of red currant, underripe strawberry and a touch of banana. The palate is light, with low-intensity flavors and a short, clean finish."
US,87.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Twisted Paso,"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Syrah and 20% Zinfandel is a little simple at first on the nose, with loamy soil and tart elderberry aromas eventually apparent. It's quite dry on the sip, with dried oregano and marjoram, and then come flavors of black fruit, graphite and black pepper."
US,93.0,50.0,Applegate Valley,Cowhorn,"These biodynamic grapes, fermented with native yeasts, spent three months in 40% new French oak. It's built like a precision watch, ticking off complete and balanced varietal flavors of citrus rind and juice, with light touches of fresh herb, lemon verbena and a delicate hint of vanilla."
US,88.0,38.0,Oakville,Swanson,"This isn't a wine to age. It's soft and appealing in its charms, offering drink-me-now cherries, red currants, herbs and sandalwood. The winemaker blended it with a little Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Verdot, which gives it structural and flavor complexities."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,Gardel,"Starts out with some heaviness and aromas of fresh cement and lacquer. With airing it improves, revealing a high-acid, fresh palate with raspberry, saline and herbal flavors. Roasted and firm on the finish, with a bit of excess heat."
US,88.0,32.0,Sonoma County,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"Earthy and leathery, this medium-bodied, ripe varietal wine dabbles in vanilla, blueberry and coffee cake aromas and flavors, finishing with a welcome softness."
Spain,90.0,28.0,Toro,Elias Mora,"Heady cherry and berry aromas are forwardly potent. This young, grippy Toro is tannic and taut on the palate. Gritty blackberry and burnt, toasty flavors finish rough, with grabby, pronounced tannins. Drink from 2017??023."
France,89.0,50.0,Santenay,ChÃ¢teau de Santenay,"While there is little white wine in Santenay, the vines for this wine come from a small parcel near the chÃ¢teau. It is soft and rounded, smooth and creamy. With white stone-fruit flavors lifted by light acidity, it is ready to drink now."
US,87.0,15.0,Santa Barbara County,Toccata,"A nice bite of acidity gives this fruity Pinot Grigio a clean finish. It's marked by savory flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruits and orange honey."
US,88.0,24.0,Livermore Valley,Longevity,"This wine is substantial enough for rich fish dishes and other entrees. It smells and tastes like almonds and apricots and has a nicely viscous texture. Full-bodied, it is complex, sophisticated, dry and has a lingering finish."
Italy,90.0,60.0,Barbaresco,Cascina Morassino,"Menthol, new leather, blue flower and sage aromas lead this wine's nose, along with a whiff of toast. Taut and savory, it offers crunchy red berry, star anise, ground clove and a hint of tobacco on the palate. Youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity lend structure."
US,94.0,62.0,Anderson Valley,Saintsbury,"This new vineyard-designate from Saintsbury has a classic profile. Spicy, woodsy, cherrylike aromas lead to layered raspberry, cinnamon and cherry flavors, with the firm texture of fine-grained tanins and good acidity. It offers a lightly tart and lingering finish. Great balance and complexity come together beautifully here."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Sicilia,Feudo Principi di Butera,"Here's a Sicilian Cabernet Sauvignon that delivers well-balanced aromas of spice, black fruit and earth. There's less emphasis on density and thickness and more on elegance and softness. The wine feels smooth and silky and offers some sweetness."
US,90.0,20.0,Lodi,Uvaggio,"If only more California Barbera could be like this. Opening with a pretty, yet rich fruit nose of dark cherry and plum, the structured wine has been tamed into a soft, chocolate-brushed finish with just the perfect amount of acidity. The vines have been in the ground since the 1880s. Winemaker Jim Moore adds just a thimble's worth (3%) of Nebbiolo too, before letting it all age in oak."
US,95.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Spottswoode,"This wine employs 73% Spottswoode Estate Vineyard fruit, but also ventures to other sites, including Young Inglewood, Oakville Ranch and Darms Lane. Dusty cedar, blackberry and pencil shavings dot a structured, classically stylized landscape, additionally seasoned in black pepper and clove. It has length for miles; enjoy best 2023 through 2033."
Italy,92.0,60.0,Toscana,Poggio Scalette,"Thick, dark concentration sets the tone, but elegance and harmony are achieved thanks to delicate mineral and balsam notes that add buoyancy and personality. This is a wine that speaks volumes about its Tuscan territory and you can almost taste that sun-drenched, chalky minerality sucked up through the vines' roots."
US,93.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Robert Biale,"This perennial favorite lives up to its word-of-mouth goodness, offering fistfuls of blueberry and huckleberry with a juicy length and throughput of acidity. Soft and strong, it's supple, floral and memorable in its deliciousness."
Italy,88.0,48.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,La Dama,"Opening with aromas of plum, leather, chocolate and oak, this bold wine is dense and extracted. The palate delivers prune, dried cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, grilled sage and black pepper. There's not enough fruit richness to support the wood tannins that leave an astringent finish."
US,88.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mazzocco,"Mazzocco's Zins are dependably superripe and high in alcohol. This '07 is a big, strong wine, offering flavors of blackberry and blueberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast and sprinkled with anisette. It's delicious and heady."
US,90.0,15.0,Red Mountain,Kiona,"This wine has become a signature variety for this winery, and this vintage shows why. It brings aromas of cranberry and cherry that lead to ripe polished dark-fruit flavors. It's near irresistible and an exceptional value."
US,86.0,58.0,Marin County,Dutton-Goldfield,"Not fully ripe, this has a flavor of green tomato jelly alongside notes of cherry and cola. It shows the delicate texture and crisp acidity you expect from this coastal vineyard, but don't try to age this wine. Drink it now."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Virgin,"Grapy and lusty, this is a barbecue-style wine for easy drinking. It floods the mouth with freshly crushed berries, plums and milk chocolate. Good value for an everyday, big red wine."
US,84.0,18.0,Sonoma County,Sonoma CuvÃ©e,"Here's a simple, softly tannic Pinot Noir to drink now for its fruitiness. Raspberry, cola and oak flavors are wrapped into a silky palate that finishes dry and spicy."
France,90.0,30.0,CÃ´tes de Bergerac,ChÃ¢teau BÃ©lingard,"From selected parcels of the BÃ©lingard vineyard, this is a firm and rich wine, with excellent concentration. The tannins are firm, dusty, broken by ripe plums and sweet acidity. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the polish of the wine. Age for another year."
Spain,92.0,26.0,Jerez,GonzÃ¡lez Byass,"Smoky campfire aromas come with notes of maple and molasses. This friendly, well-balanced Cream tastes of chocolate, figs and dates. The finish also tastes chocolaty, while vanilla and caramel notes make it all the more lovable."
France,91.0,30.0,Maury,Mas Amiel,"Aged in glass demijohns for one year and oak tuns for nine, this is a mature selection that's ready to drink now, though it can certainly keep for many more years to come. A beautiful rancio characteristic leads, with aromas of walnut shell, orange oil and earthy spice fill the bouquet. Skin-driven fruit flavors of cherry and plum dominate the gripping palate, while the complex finish reveals accents of black tea, licorice root and baking spice."
US,93.0,60.0,Santa Maria Valley,Flying Goat Cellars,"Christmas-like aromas of juniper, pine and forest floor hit the nose hard on this bottling from the historic vineyard, all leveled by fresh squeezed pomegranate juice, wild sweet mint and pencil shavings. A woody character reminiscent of uncured sandalwood powers the palate, which also shows cranberry juice and pipe tobacco in the background."
Italy,85.0,60.0,Val di Cornia Suvereto,Volpaiole,"This vintage of Volpaiole's (Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) shows a fresh or unripe note of green pepper and rosemary. Ultimately, there is more dimension here compared to 2006."
France,90.0,24.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Meyer-FonnÃ©,"Green and yellow apple notes play on the nose. They also fizz frothily on the fresh easy palate?almost weightless and totally dry. There are slightly bitter edges to the dry finish which are not unpleasant. With its litheness, this comes across as very refreshing and wonderfully pure."
US,92.0,80.0,Temecula Valley,Monte De Oro,"This bottling's deeply layered nose shows black plum, blackberry, vanilla and licorice aromas. The impressive palate starts with rich baked-blueberry flavors before clove and dried ginger spices arrive to provide depth. The tannins are firm but not in the way."
US,84.0,22.0,Carneros,Buena Vista,"A bit heavy for a rosÃ©, without quite the liveliness you want. It's a very fruity wine, with forward raspberry, vanilla, cocoa and spice flavors."
US,88.0,13.0,Arroyo Seco,Jekel,"A clean, brisk Chardonnay made from this small, cool part of Monterey County's Salinas Valley. Shows its region's bright acidity, and also its long hangtime flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, limes and minerals. Nothing fancy or showy, just a really nice Chard at a fair price."
France,84.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau des Tourtes,"Toasted almond aromas follow through to give this wine a creamy, nutty character. There's vanilla, soft acidity and a final thrust of acidity."
France,85.0,30.0,MÃ¢con-Chardonnay,Collovray et Terrier,"Very tangy in texture, it has spice from wood aging and a crisply fresh character. It is bright and light, and very lemony at the end."
US,93.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gramercy,"This is modeled on southern RhÃ´ne blends?a fairly straightforward mix of 85% Syrah and 15% Grenache. Grainy and smoky, with a slight charred aspect, this focused effort displays deep pomegranate fruit, soaked in soy, balsamic and other umami notes."
US,84.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Maddalena,"This soft, simple Cabernet will go just fine with everyday fare. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with proper varietal flavors of blackberries, currants and smoky oak."
US,94.0,135.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, along with 20% Malbec, all from the producer's estate. A mix of coconut and cherry-berry cobbler entice aromatically, seasoned in dried herb and black peppercorn. Dry, dusty tannins make their presence felt, the wine all in all tart, generous and lively, finishing in a slow drag of tobacco."
US,90.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Aromas of huckleberry, herbs and spice are fresh and focused. The fruit flavors are concentrated, with a supple feel and soft tannins. It displays a good sense of balance."
France,88.0,22.0,Gigondas,Louis Bernard,"This attractively priced Gigondas is a solid example, boasting traditional notes of leather and spiced meat. It's supple and slightly warm, with modest cherry fruit coated with a dusting of dry red earth. Clove and metallic notes on the finish suggest early consumption is the prudent option."
Australia,96.0,820.0,Eden Valley,Henschke,"Is this the Yin to Grange's Yang? The wines are completely different, yet almost always destined to be discussed together. The 2010 HoG is aromatic and bright, with raspberry and cranberry fruit notes, hints of mint and a pinch of peppery spice. It's full-bodied, but with elegant, supple tannins that ease gently into a long, crisp finish. Drink now??030."
US,92.0,38.0,Dundee Hills,Sokol Blosser,"The least-expensive designate is also one of Sokol Blosser's best in 2012. After opening with a whiff of funk supported with a flinty hint of clay, it moves into a complex palate with both grip and definition. The acid component brings flavors of sweet citrus and orange peel, while the overall structure and pretty red fruits suggest that this is a wine to cellar. Drink now through 2024."
France,90.0,20.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Joseph Mellot,"A single estate run by Joseph Mellot, this produces an impressive ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, at this stage youthful with exuberant white fruits and grapefruit, and an obvious need to age for 1?? years."
Italy,94.0,60.0,Sicilia,Duca di Salaparuta,"Scents of ripe dark-skinned fruit, leather, carob, black culinary spice and Mediterranean herbs meld in the glass. The polished, structured palate includes juicy blackberry, ripe black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and exotic spice alongside velvety tannins that lend a smooth, almost creamy texture. This seamlessly combines full flavor, power and elegance."
US,89.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Davenport Cellars,"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the rest SÃ©millon, this attractive white wine has an appealing snap to the fruit and an underlying acidity that sets it up in lively fashion. It's a food wine through and through, lightly toasty, with green berries and apples providing the clean fruit flavors. A fine value."
Spain,83.0,15.0,ValdepeÃ±as,ViÃ±a Albali,"This is cedary and dry smelling, with more spice than fruit aromas. It feels crisp, tight and acidic, with flavors of raspberry, red plum and forced spice coming from the heavy oak. Dry, oaky and spicy on the finish."
US,91.0,60.0,Dundee Hills,Vista Hills,"Produced at White Rose winery, this estate bottling is compact and spicy, framing its raspberry and red plum fruit with aromatic herbs. Tannins are stiff and granular, stretching out in a finish streaked with cacao, espresso and mineral."
US,87.0,34.0,Santa Clara Valley,Jason-Stephens,"Juicy in red and blue fruit, this wine is soft in texture and mannered tannins with a burst of leather on the finish. From estate-grown grapes, it'll go well with a rib roast or more casual burgers."
US,90.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Transcendence,"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon."
US,92.0,55.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Thomas Fogarty,"This is dry, silky and enormously complex, with flavors of raspberry, cherry, cola, new oak and spice that satisfy through the long finish. The mountain vineyard concentrated the fruit, yielding savory power. It's a beautiful Pinot Noir to drink now with steaks or lamb chops."
France,91.0,37.0,Saint-Joseph,Les Vins de Vienne,"The least expensive Saint-Joseph from LVV is this attractively tarry, smoky offering. It offers exciting complexity, marrying herbal, savory notes of black olive, smoke and wood ash with just enough blackberry and raspberry fruit while remaining medium bodied and almost delicate on the palate. Drink now??018."
France,91.0,55.0,Aloxe-Corton,ChÃ¢teau de Santenay,"Old vines planted in a small parcel at the base of the Corton hill give this ripe and rich wine. Full of jammy fruit, it has structure as well as strawberry and red-cherry flavors, packed with juiciness that comes from the acidity. This wine has a good future. Drink from 2020."
Italy,90.0,60.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Corte Rugolin,"Aromas recall nail polish remover, black cherry marinated in spirits and exotic spice. The thick palate delivers prune, mocha, dark chocolate and coffee bean alongside velvety tannins. It has a long finish and closes on a bitter, nutty note."
US,86.0,14.0,California,Caricature,"Jammy and maple-syrup aromas and full, broad and ripe fruit flavors make this a mouthfilling wine. It has a touch of sweetness with moderate tannins for balance, and a lingering, spicy-sweet note on the finish."
US,85.0,25.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Coyote Canyon,"The aromas smell disjointed, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla and maple syrup. The palate is quite sweet and ripe, with abundant baking-spice accents."
Argentina,89.0,19.0,Salta,Alta Vista,"Tropical fruit aromas come with notes of bath soap and white-flower blossom. This is easygoing and healthy on the palate, with just enough snappy acidity. Flavors of lime and green banana run long on the finish, which shows a touch of the variety's patented oily bitterness. Drink immediately."
US,86.0,49.0,Alexander Valley,Inspiri,"A bit sharp in the mouth, with a cut of tartness that age is unlikely to soften. Otherwise, this blend of mostly Merlot, with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, is polished and dry, with blackberry and black currant flavors."
Argentina,85.0,12.0,Mendoza,San Felipe,"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness."
US,94.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Baked bread, pine forest and strawberry rise out of the glass in this relatively light yet complex and layered wine, spicy in cinnamon and black tea. It shows the powerful grace of good winemaking, showcasing the appellation's beauty and brawn from a warm, even year."
US,87.0,29.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"This is a bright, brisk wine that's chock full of crisp red-plum flavors and a sweet cherry-blossom perfume that lingers from start to finish. Brisk acidity and loads of fresh, green herbal notes meld nicely with soft, but mouthfilling tannins."
France,86.0,15.0,Coteaux Bourguignons,Vignerons des Pierres DorÃ©es,"From the area known as Pierres DorÃ©es because of the gold-colored stone used in buildings, this wine is soft and fruity. It carries a touch of tannin along with red-cherry crispness. The wine is ready to drink."
Italy,92.0,90.0,Toscana,Tenuta Villa Trasqua,"From a 300-acre property in Castellina in Chianti, Trasolo (100% Merlot) is a top-shelf wine with rich opulence and sophistication. Deep layers of cherry, blackberry, spice and leather are folded tight together and the wine is smooth and enduring on the close."
US,87.0,45.0,Alexander Valley,Geyser Peak,"Nice and dry, a full-bodied red wine whose dusty tannins and dried herb notes testify to its Alexander Valley terroir. Not a blockbuster, but rich enough in cherries and blackberries to satisfy. Now??013."
Spain,80.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Mureda,"Chunky, wayward aromas are vague at best. This has no structural integrity, while waxy green-apple flavors come with bitterness and a flabby, oily finish. Barely passable."
US,80.0,22.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Villa Toscano,"Sweet with a burnt aftertaste, this wine cannot be highly recommended."
US,91.0,30.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gainey,"A solid Pinot Noir for its price, this offers all the expected flavors and strikes a balance between richness and freshness. Wild cherry, anise, sagebrush and slate aromas lead into a palate that packs ripe red fruit upfront, followed by tangy elderberry, plum skin, hibiscus and rose. A touch of elderflower adds depth."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Alto Adige,Girlan,"A zesty wine, its fragrances suggest stone fruit, cut grass, pineapple and a mineral note. The bright, lively palate delivers yellow peach, papaya and citrus alongside a steely mineral note and crisp acidity."
US,88.0,24.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"The nose on this bottling is quite reductive at first, with cut grass and damp herb aromas mixing up with dried seaweed and light lemon peel. There is a tart green-grass flavor to the palate, but also a slightly riper Anjou pear component, with a salty freshness emerging toward the finish."
France,87.0,16.0,Gaillac,L'Enclos des Braves,"Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins. It gives a wine that could benefit from aging while also being ready to drink now. Give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until 2016."
US,89.0,35.0,Carmel Valley,Galante,"There's lots of vitality to this Cab, which was blended with Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec. It's complex on the palate with a spectrum of flavors ranging from blackberries and cherries to herbs and mushrooms. It's silky in texture and thoroughly dry in style. Drink now??015."
Italy,87.0,32.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Col di Lamo,"Bright and easygoing, this opens with pretty scents of blue flower, woodland berry and a hint of earth. The simple, rather slender palate offers fresh strawberry and a white pepper note alongside zesty acidity and limber tannins."
France,88.0,50.0,Champagne,Dom Caudron,"Based in the Marne Valley, this producer is a specialist in Pinot Meunier?here, it's 90% of the blend. The orange-pink wine is full of red fruits balanced with attractive acidity. A light tannic edge gives the wine a final bite."
US,90.0,28.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Riverhaven,"Excellent varietal character, along with the lightly funky aromas associated with the vineyard's location in the Rocks (a sub-section of the Walla Walla Valley AVA), elevate this first release from Riverhaven Cellars. Along with blackberry fruit come cinnamon, mocha, coffee grounds and clean earth, well integrated into a rich and textural wine with good length and body."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Barolo,Mario Marengo,"This opens with black, inky intensity and generous aromas of ripe fruit, raspberry, plum, moist earth and pipe tobacco. The mouthfeel is earthy and gritty with astringent tannins on the finish. Hold this for 10??5 years."
US,92.0,30.0,Alexander Valley,Lancaster,"Flinty and austere, this is an elegant white wine crafted from 100% Musque clone, dancing in pear and grapefruit. The layered texture impressively stands out, riding the wave between creamy and lemony crisp with precision, opening the door for the wine to finish refreshingly."
Spain,84.0,130.0,Rioja,Telmo RodrÃ­guez,"From a mediocre vintage, it seems as though the winery poured on the fully toasted oak to cover up marginal fruit. This smells like burnt meat and rubber, tastes charred and baked, and finishes blackened and overly toasty, with a choppy feel and hard tannins."
US,84.0,19.0,Russian River Valley,Fanucchi,"Smells honeyed and tastes like one of those fruity bottled sodas. It's a riot of peaches, pears and vanilla cream, with a honey-sweet finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,XYZin,"Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it."
France,88.0,30.0,Chablis,Domaine Christian Moreau PÃ¨re et Fils,"From vineyards on the cooler south bank of the Serein, this wine is crisp and tightly coiled despite the warmth of the 2015 vintage. It's built on a backbone of sturdy minerality, fleshed out with crisp, citrus fruit, and will be ready to drink from late 2017."
US,85.0,30.0,Amador County,Renwood,"If this wine had greater acidity for crispness, it would be near perfect, but as it stands, it's too soft. Too bad, because the flavors, of blackberries, cassis, chocolate, anise, mint and smoky vanilla, are totally delicious. The flabbiness is cause for concern."
France,90.0,20.0,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,"While this is pink fizz, its intent is serious and showcases the structure of Pinot Noir. The palate is dry and displays some pleasant bitterness around the edges, accentuating both dryness and austerity. This will work better at the table?say with salmon sashimi?rather than as an apÃ©ritif. This is a serious wine, so explore its hidden charms."
Italy,88.0,27.0,Venezia Giulia,Plozner,"Plozner's Malpelo boasts a very pretty copper color with pink and amber highlights and aromas of grapefruit, pear and peach. Pinot Grigio has a dark skin color so this wine represents the way the variety was made before it earned fame as a white wine."
US,90.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),DeLille,"Sauvignon Blanc makes up three-quarters of this blend with the balance SÃ©millon. The aromas offer notes of herb, toast, nut oil and star fruit. The elegantly styled flavors of kiwi and spice are creamy in feel with a lingering finish."
US,86.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mazzocco,"With more than 16% alcohol, this Zin has a hot mouthfeel, even for Dry Creek Zinfandel. Still, it's dry and smooth, with savory flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, red and black currants, bacon and pepper. It's a good example of its type, and of Mazzocco's house style."
US,91.0,22.0,Willamette Valley,Ponzi,"This delightful rosÃ© bursts open with ripe watermelon and strawberry scents and flavors. Highlights suggest candied rose petals, and the flavors continue into cherry soda and hints of pink peppercorn. It's a big bold fruity simply fabulous bottle."
US,84.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Kokomo,"The alcohol is refreshingly moderate on this blush wine, which has appealing flavors of oranges, limes and tropical fruits, brightened with soft acidity. It's almost as sweet as a dessert wine, with a sugary finish."
Argentina,86.0,17.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Piattelli,"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years."
Italy,89.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Canalicchio Franco Pacenti,"Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance."
US,93.0,69.0,Napa Valley,Redmon,"Lots of depth and complexity in this single-vineyard Cabernet. It's dramatic for the layers of fruit, veering toward red berries, cherries and cocoa, and for the intense tannin structure. Feels vital and important and, above all, ageable. Give it a good six years in the cellar."
US,89.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"Aromas of gun smoke, blue fruit and herbs are followed by palate-coating cherry and chocolate flavors. The finish is impressive."
US,89.0,54.0,Sonoma Valley,Muscardini,"Smoothly voluptuous, this is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon with 20% Zinfandel, 10% Syrah and 5% Merlot. Leather, red fruit, cigar and syrup combine to full-bodied effect, ending in a thickness of structure and power."
Spain,96.0,82.0,Rioja,RemÃ­rez de Ganuza,"Concentrated to the hilt, with molten black fruit, coconut and mint aromas. The palate is driven, tannic, pure and features dynamite flavors of black fruit, bitter chocolate and spice cake. So beautiful and big, but also showing elegance and restraint. Drinkable now but will age well for another seven years or more."
US,90.0,38.0,Finger Lakes,Sheldrake Point,"This is a luscious boldly extracted Cabernet Sauvignon full of fleshy ripe blackberry and plum flavors. It's also a nuanced wine, shaded by wisps of smoke and bramble, and calibrated with zesty mouthwatering acidity. The finish is marked by lingering spice and ripe rigid tannins."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Val di Neto,Librandi,Aromas of green apple and Bartlett pear lead the nose on this attractive blend of 90% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon. The creamy palate offers juicy white peach and tangerine brightened by fresh acidity.
US,87.0,10.0,California,Glass Mountain,"From Markham, this medium-weight effort adds a touch of mint and a creamy, lactic note to blackberry and blueberry fruit. The finish is long, highlighting waves of supersoft tannins and juicy berries. ?J.C."
Spain,83.0,12.0,La Mancha,MontgÃ³,"Pineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Isola dei Nuraghi,Argiolas,"This blend of Nasco and Vermentino from Sardinia leads with heady floral aromas of honeysuckle and spring flowers. The palate delivers rich white peach, melon and tangerine peel. Crisp, refreshing acidity reins in the lush flavors, lending a polished feel."
US,87.0,28.0,Paso Robles,Russian Ridge,"Made in a soft, fruity style, this darkly colored wine brims with complex flavors of blackberries, red licorice, grilled prosciutto, coffee, black pepper and sandalwood. Drink with steaks, chops and stews."
US,86.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Atwater,"Slightly dusty, herbal notes distract from pleasant peach and strawberry flavors in this dry rosÃ© made from Pinot Noir along with a splash of Chardonnay. It's delicate in concentration but refreshing on the palate."
Italy,87.0,39.0,Toscana,Olivi,"A fifty-fifty blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this densely concentrated wine has aromas that suggest underbrush, wet leaves, black berries and prune. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry, raisin, black pepper, espresso, bitter dark chocolate and a sugary vanilla note alongside solid tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Used Automobile Parts,"The question is whether or not this wine will age, for it sure is tannic. Burns from entry to exit, and it's not the alcohol, which is modest. It's a very ripe, fruity Bordeaux blend, brimming with blackberry, cherry, licorice and cola flavors, and is flat-out delicious, except for those astringent tannins. Give it until sometime in 2008, and it should drink well for an additional six years."
France,85.0,35.0,Vin de France,Henri Milan,"A wine with only natural sulfur, it feels lean, with piercing acidity and firm tannins. It is young and all the elements should fall into place, but with the fruit's stalky character the wine will always be dry."
US,85.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Rutz,"Oak stars in this wine, to its detriment. Underneath all that wood is a crisply elegant Chardonnay with ripe pear, peach and papaya flavors. But the oak plasters it with a ton of caramel and butterscotch that tastes excessive."
US,90.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Madorom,"With rich, ripe black and red cherry, mocha, cinnamon and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into a smooth, silky texture, this Merlot is a good followup to the winery's 2008 vintage. Drink it soon with a nice char-broiled steak."
Argentina,83.0,19.0,Patagonia,Familia Schroeder,"Stemmy and lightly green on the nose, with raspberry and plum filling in the blanks. The palate is a bit hollow and empty, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Not bad but it does shows stemminess and raspy qualities."
US,85.0,14.0,Sonoma Valley,Mission Hardware,"This Merlot-Zinfandel blend is very dry, full-bodied and rustic, with blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors that have bitter tobacco notes on the finish. Good with everyday fare."
France,87.0,25.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Pierre de Montignac,"A gently perfumed wine, it has ripe, juicy black-fruit flavors and a backing of tannins. It's balanced with the dry core surrounded by rich fruitiness and a burst of final acidity. It could be drunk now, but will be better from 2016."
France,84.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Producteurs Plaimont,"Light, crisp and fresh, this is the epitome of summer rosÃ© apÃ©ritifs. It comes from a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, bright and lively with just a hint of the typical caramel flavor of a Merlot rosÃ©. Drink now."
France,86.0,25.0,Bourgogne,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux,"Light tannins and attractive red-berry fruits give this wine its instant appeal. It is soft, fruity, with a juicy, crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
US,87.0,15.0,Oregon,Valley View,"Lots of ripe apple and tropical fruits, lots of butterscotch and caramel flavors, but not too heavy. Good balance, good acids, a very appealing, forward style which isn't too oaky or heavy for food."
Argentina,86.0,18.0,Mendoza,La Posta,"Crisp cherry and plum aromas are gritty. This Malbec shows wiry acidity but the palate is still a touch soupy. Salty plum and oak spice flavors include notes of clove and pepper. As a whole, this is oaky and fairly heavy."
US,92.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Charles Smith,"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines."
Argentina,87.0,17.0,Mendoza,Domiciano de Barrancas,"Sweet black plum, licorice and anise aromas are soft yet nice. The palate, however, is more clacky, with jammy, reduced flavors of syrupy berry and sappy tannins. Jammy and saturated on the finish as well; tons of berry and size, but not perfectly balanced."
US,86.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,Wind Rose,"Blended with 15% Barbera, this is an aromatically intriguing wine with notes of rose water, sour cherry, and dried flowers. It's tart with brawny, firm tannins and cranberry-like acidity. Serve it at the dinner table to see it at its best."
Italy,90.0,49.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fanti,"Aromas of underbrush, ripe plum, chopped herb, dark spice and espresso meld together with a balsamic note. The firmly structured palate offers dried cherry, prune, coffee and clove alongside tightly knit close-grained tannins that leave a grippy finish. You'll also notice the warmth of evident alcohol on the close."
US,90.0,26.0,Willamette Valley,Territorial,"Here is a well-priced example of the outstanding 2014 Oregon Pinots. Black cherry and pomegranate fruits make for a juicy fresh fruit-driven palate. There's a touch of cola and caffÃ¨ latte as well. It's seen 20% new French oak, to good effect."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Mazzei,"This Chianti Classico Riserva is a balanced and intense wine with beautiful aromas of dark fruit, sweet spice, chocolate fudge, espresso bean and pipe tobacco. That bright Sangiovese freshness pops in on the finish."
US,92.0,25.0,Anderson Valley,Handley,"This is a beautiful wine to look at for the coppery-gold color and the fierce explosion of fine bubbles. Smells luscious, with subtle raspberry, lime, bread and lees aromas. This is the best rosÃ© Handley has ever produced: amazingly rich, long and full-bodied, with the creamy smoothness of Champagne."
US,87.0,25.0,Edna Valley,Wolff,"The new clone on the block finally makes it onto the front label. Soft and silky, this wine has cherry-berry flavors with an earthy streak of tobacco and sage. There are some firm tannins that kick in on the finish, which suggest six months of aging."
US,87.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Kiamie,"A successful blend of Roussanne and Viognier that impresses for its complex swirl of fruits and spices, and maintains a clean, healthy balance. The peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors are enlivened with very crisp acidity that makes the wine finish clean and savory."
US,87.0,85.0,Chalk Hill,Chalk Hill,"Tasting sweet and hot, this sure is ripe. It has extracted flavors of jammy blackberry, cherry and cola. Drink now."
US,89.0,22.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"A lingering vein of dark char, spice and toast acts as a counterpoint to this wine's ripe, black-fruited character. The palate is rich and densely concentrated, kept taut by a frame of bold tannins. It's pleasant now but should develop smoky, savory complexities through 2023."
US,87.0,45.0,Anderson Valley,Jim Ball,"This is a solid Pinot, ripe in raspberries and cherries, with fine coastal acidity and firm tannins. It has a silky mouthfeel the way Pinot Noir should."
US,90.0,75.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Robert O. Smasne,"A raisiny and ultraripe Bordeaux-style blend, two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. It has apparently been given a lot of time in heavily-toasted barrels, and the layers of smoke, espresso, cinnamon and tobacco dominate. A wine for those who like the blockbuster, oaky style."
US,88.0,47.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Demetria,"Cola and soft red raspberry scents show on the nose of this blend of 58% Grenache, 25% MourvÃ¨dre, 17% Syrah. It's easy-drinking and simple, with red fruit, white pepper and asphalt hints. A great, light, quaffable red for a warm day."
US,82.0,15.0,Fiddletown,Damas,"Inexpensive, this Zin is quite ripe and quite oaky, a big mouthful of wine ready to enjoy now."
Argentina,89.0,12.0,Valle de Uco,FranÃ§ois Lurton,"Dusty peach and nectarine aromas are subtle and draw you toward a balanced palate with modest weight and natural-feeling acidity. Peach, melon and quince flavors finish firm and elegant. This wine has a French character to it."
US,88.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"All the fruit for this wine comes from Bacchus Vineyard. Aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle and apricot lead to medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors that linger."
US,92.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Ãcluse,"Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling. It's quite soft on the palate, with black plum and hoisin sauce flavors accenting its core of dried purple fruit, black pepper and bacon fat. The finish offers a touch of maple syrup."
Argentina,87.0,23.0,Mendoza,Tikal,"Inky in color, with exotic, gaseous and balsamic aromas of black fruits and iodine, this biodynamic Malbec-Syrah blend is funky, jumpy, tartatic and jumbled on the palate. Stew, somewhat sour and earthy berry flavors finish scratchy but with length and energy."
US,90.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Robert Biale,"This wine has a quiet entry and soft lilt of cinnamon and black pepper spice. A grip of strong-willed tannin envelops a firm concentration of red berry, leather pouch and mountain sage."
US,95.0,60.0,Sonoma Coast,Hirsch,"Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015."
France,88.0,24.0,Alsace,Domaine Saint-RÃ©my,"Gentle notes of creaminess and ripe pears signal a soft, creamy wine with lots of texture and body. The rounded body carries some weight and is edged with a bitter marzipan note. All this is countered by fresh acidity, more creamy, nutty notes and a vanilla finish."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Franciacorta,Ronco Calino,"Elegant and creamy, with pretty highlights of peach, melon and toasted bread, this beautiful Italian sparkler makes a perfect opener for a long and sophisticated meal. Foamy effervescence gives the wine depth and persistency."
Australia,84.0,18.0,Margaret River,Xanadu,"Leafy and herbal on the nose, but the flavors are clean, favoring cassis over the green stuff. Light-bodied, with modest tannins, this would pair well with chops or burgers."
US,86.0,15.0,Ancient Lakes,Jones of Washington,"The aromas of herbs, pink grapefruit and guava don't seem entirely knitted together on this young wine. It's dry and fleshy in feel but doesn't have the concentration to bring it all together."
US,90.0,45.0,Mendocino,Lula,"Spicy, oaky and rich in flavor and texture, this wine tastes of vanilla, butter and ripe red cherries upon first sip, feels soft and easy on the palate. As it opens, more fruit and oaky spice flavors emerge, while firm tannins give it grip."
France,89.0,25.0,Chorey-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Joseph Drouhin,"From its situation on the plain outside Beaune, Chorey is often overlooked. A wine like this, ripe and smooth, full of red fruit, offers a deliciously juicy drink and represents a great value in red Burgundy. Drink now, or keep for two years."
US,89.0,24.0,North Fork of Long Island,Paumanok,"Exuberant aromas of white blossoms and ripe stonefruit settle substantially in the glass, revealing a rich yet layered palate that marries sweet cream and butter notes with lemon pith, smoke and striking acidity. Full and opulent, but elegant and balanced. Drink now."
US,86.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Ventosa,"While quite savory on the nose, wafting of pressed apples and dill, the palate of this semisweet Riesling evokes sweeter tones of honey and grapefruit. It's a bit candied and confectionery in style, but finishes on a bracing citrus note."
US,85.0,8.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"The plum, herb and spice aromas are elusive. The cherry flavors are light but come straight down the fairway. One wants more concentration, but it delivers easy-drinking pleasure."
US,86.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"This is off-dry, roughly 2% residual sugar, and it nicely balances the sugar and the acids, using the floral and spicy character of the grape to fill out the middle. It's a pretty wine, fruity with peach, melon and grapefruit."
US,94.0,45.0,Oregon,Domaine J. Meuret,"The second release of this Oregon Pinot project from Walla Walla's Jon Meuret (Maison Bleue) is irresistible. A three-clone blend from a top Columbia Gorge vineyard, it's explosively aromatic, with a strong whiff of pipe tobacco that Meuret believes is a vineyard marker. Those powerful aromatics push into a dense core of strawberry-cherry fruit, enhanced by oak notes. Delicious now, this has the structure and power to cellar well. Drink now through 2028."
France,91.0,30.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,Chateau La Tour Carnet,"The ancient vineyard of Tour Carnet, first planted in the 15th century, is into a renaissance. This wine, which showed too many tannins when in barrel, is now coming to life. The balance, the acidity and the seductive perfumes promise plenty. So does the structure, just hinting at bitterness, a function of its youthfulness. Keep for 5?? years."
US,92.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),K Vintners,"The fruit comes from the cool climate Den Hoed vineyard. It was barrel fermented in neutral French oak Burgundy barrels, yielding a racy, razor-sharp, spicy, detailed, delicious wine. Lovely fruit is highlighted with peppery notes, running the gamut from cucumber on through to tropical flavors. Ripe, full, lingering."
US,95.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best."
Italy,91.0,38.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Gabbiano,"Baked plum, Asian spice, vanilla and menthol aromas carry the nose. The elegantly structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated French oak alongside fine-grained tannins that lend firm, polished support. A coffee note marks the finish."
US,88.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Hightower,"This well-crafted red wine is supple and smooth. It opens with scents of violets and berries, fills in with round, lush berry and cherry fruit flavors, then applies a wash of milk chocolate to the tannins."
Italy,90.0,38.0,Barbaresco,Musso,"Rose, violet, baking spice and red berry aromas come together on this graceful wine. The bright, subtle palate offers crushed raspberry, red cherry and white pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. A star anise note signals the close."
Spain,88.0,19.0,Rioja,Marques de Tomares,"Falls into the dark and roasted category, with aromas of leather, black fruits and toast. The palate is saturated and full, with dark, roasted black fruit, molasses and spice flavors. Warm on the finish almost to the point of being hot, but not quite. A very solid wine overall."
US,92.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Raymond,"This is the darkest, biggest, richest of Raymond's 2007 Cabernets. It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong. Designed for the cellar, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 10??2 years."
US,85.0,23.0,North Fork of Long Island,Pellegrini Vineyards,"With hints of barnyard and graphite accenting lush notes of blackberries, cassis and ceder, this distinctly Old World-style Cabernet is fascinatingly complex, yet undeniably simple in style. It's austere on the palate with layers of fine, yet penetrating tannins and a finish that's just a tad astringent."
France,86.0,20.0,CrÃ©mant de Limoux,Sieur d'Arques,"Delicate notes of wood-grilled apples, walnut skin and lightly toasted brioche take center stage on this sparkler. Balanced and creamy in the mouth, with a nice streak of ruby red grapefruit pith unfolding on the clean finish."
Italy,95.0,60.0,Bolgheri Superiore,Tenuta Argentiera,In terms of overall quality this is the best yet from this sea-facing estate in coastal Tuscany. The blend sees Cabernet Sauvignon enhanced by Merlot and Cabernet Franc and the overall effect is one of impressive intensity and sophistication. The finish is velvety rich and smooth.
US,92.0,37.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Fess Parker,"Fresh aromas of salty lemon cream, wet slate and riverstones, as well as a touch of slightly sour yogurt, show on the nose of this bottling from the vineyard named after Fess Parker's daughter, who now runs much of the company. The lively palate combines squeezes of citrus with a creamy mouthfeel that offers hints of nuts and orangesicle. It's a very cohesive wine."
Australia,92.0,35.0,Rutherglen,Stanton & Killeen,"Dark amber in color, this example of classic Muscat is wonderfully balanced between the freshness of youth and the power and complexity of age. Raisin, malt and Guinness stout-like notes meet vibrant orange-zest and honey characters in a sweet, harmonious whole."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Catalunya,Torres,"A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry. The body is medium in weight and intensity, with pure but basic cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Like all other parts of the wine, the finish is easy and clean, with carry-over flavors of berry fruit."
US,86.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"This RhÃ´ne-style white blend has a floral highlight that leads into tart white fruit, jicama, celery and melon flavors. A light grass-like note is also apparent, and the palate could use some more concentration."
US,84.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Billsboro,"This wine has a lush nose?vanilla, spice?but its flavor is refreshing and crisp. Waves of spice and citrus are well balanced and elegant. A simple but food-friendly sip."
US,91.0,32.0,Sierra Foothills,La Folia Winery,"Wonderful, spicy oak aromas and ripe flavors give this eye-opening, full-bodied wine a lot to like. It has hints of new leather, cedar and tobacco along with opulent plum-like fruit and a lavish layer of fine tannins to support all the richness. This is the third 90-plus showing in the last four vintages."
France,90.0,32.0,Gers,Domaine de Gensac,"A blend of white Bordeaux and local Gers grapes, this is a smooth, medium sweet wine. With three years of aging, it has become mature, rich in smoky flavors as well as dried apricot and bitter oranges. Acidity keeps everything in line. It's ready to drink."
US,90.0,48.0,McMinnville,Winderlea,"Planted in 1988, this vineyard 's fruit captures the unique minerality found in this AVA. It leaves an impression of sucking on rock?not a bad thing in a wine. The black-cherry fruit grips the palate with real power and some density, with potent herbal highlights as well. Drink this now through the mid-2020s."
Spain,83.0,13.0,Navarra,Zorzal,"Stalky aromas of compost-laden berry fruits lack clarity and freshness. This feels chunky on the palate, with herbal, salty flavors of earthy berry fruits."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Alto Adige,Andriano,"You really can't beat the purity and liveliness of this luminous Chardonnay. This is a pure expression of the grape in its essence. The nose shows little sign of winery intervention and the mouthfeel is creamy and rich in a very understated, elegant way."
US,86.0,24.0,Lodi,Fenestra,"A wine with a soft mouthfeel and clean finish, this takes time to open up. Once it does, the flavors are a swirl of sweet strawberry and roses."
Spain,88.0,19.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Aljibes,"Leafy herbal saucy aromas of plum and currant come with hints of tobacco and cafÃ© mocha. This blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo has a Bordeaux-like flavor profile complete with leafy plum and herbal spice notes. On the finish, this holds onto its herbal character."
France,89.0,24.0,Luberon,ChÃ¢teau Val Joanis,"This pale, copper-tinged rosÃ© boasts aromas of melon, citrus and stone fruit. It's medium in weight, with a silky feel on the palate and harmonious blend of fruit that finishes crisp. Drink now."
US,86.0,16.0,California,Korbel,"This is a nice, dry sparkling wine, rich in citrus, apple, yeasty brioche and spice flavors. The bubbles are a little ragged, giving it a scoury mouthfeel. But for the price, it's a fine bubbly."
US,88.0,32.0,Sonoma Coast,Portalupi,"Cherry liqueur akin to kirsch rises aromatically, along with a lavender perfume. Light and high-strung, this is a tightly wound wine, punched in acidity and savory tea. The finish displays bold swathes of oak."
US,91.0,22.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Koehler,"Pale pink in color, this wine offers nice touches of bubblegum and watermelon, with lively white pepper for a complex twist. Clean and lovely lines of pink strawberry, rocky minerality and more of that intriguing pepper spice continue on the palate that leaves the mouth watering. It's a great pink."
US,92.0,36.0,California,Prospect 772,"This starts with a smoky aroma, like charred steak over the grill. Then highly concentrated fruit flavors zoom across the tongue, along with very firm tannins and powerful, ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors backed by a mouth-coating texture. It's an unusually focused and structured wine."
France,88.0,33.0,Fixin,Derey FrÃ¨res,"This finely balanced, juicy wine is full of red-fruit aromas and brisk acidity. Juicy and bright with strawberry flavors and refreshing acidity, it's a value wine with great potential. Drink from 2015."
US,92.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"Scents of cinnamon, peppery herbs and Asian spices. Lovely, detailed and deep, this blends sharply etched red and purple fruits with seams of vanilla and cut tobacco. Flavors follow, with medium acidity and leafy tannins. Nicely balanced, spiced, varietal and persistent."
US,87.0,26.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Spicy with cola and black tea, this Livermore Zin has an earthy touch amid its ripe raspberry and oak. It would pair well with the usual suspects of barbecue and other grilled meats."
France,91.0,40.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau Meyney,"The second wine of ChÃ¢teau Meyney comes from one of the top estates of the appellation. From selected parcels and barrels of wine, this shows the same sense of structure as the top wine, while the fruitiness is developing more quickly. The black currant and plum-juice flavors are already bursting from the tannins. Drink from 2017."
US,90.0,20.0,Sonoma Coast,Joseph Carr,"This crisp and balanced wine offers lemon, guava and papaya, tropical without being cloying. With enough viscous creaminess to keep it medium in weight, it's soft and herbal, with measured acidity and a golden color. It finishes lean and savory."
US,84.0,20.0,Carmel Valley,Joullian,"A quite remarkable mauve-pink in color, this offers faint cherry aromas. It's nearly sweet on the palate, with strawberries and hard red berry candy flavors."
US,93.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dunham,"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat."
US,90.0,35.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ampelos,"Made from 100% estate grapes, this wine is shy in aroma but happily light and bright on the palate. It's delicate yet framed by firm tannins, showing blueberry and toasty oak flavors and nuanced acidity."
US,92.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Babcock,"Extremely tight, clean and minerally aromas of chalk, citrus pith and lemongrass make for a very crisp and fresh nose on this white wine bottling of the typically red Grenache grape. The palate is just as zesty, with apple skin, green papaya and underripe mango flavors, showing flashes of tropicality while remaining light and tight."
US,89.0,62.0,Red Mountain,Sparkman,"Klipsun Vineyard provides all of the Cabernet for this wine, with a splash of Petit Verdot (6%) coming from Olsen. Aromas of sweet herb, spice, wet copper penny and cherry lead to a full-bodied palate that shows a fine sense of balance. This vineyard's often substantial tannins are well tamed."
US,83.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Tyee Wine Cellars,"Thin tasting, like apple cider, with high acidity and a slight scent of animal."
US,86.0,18.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"Rich, ripe and oaky, with crisp acidity and notes of pineapple jam and buttered toast. Tasty and flashy, but is marked with a slightly vegetal flavor."
US,90.0,24.0,Russian River Valley,Ledson,"Has that pure appellation fruit taste of ripe green apples and sweet pears, framed in crisp acids. Feels bright and delicious in the mouth, accented with oak notes of vanilla and smoke. A creamy texture lends allure. This rich, hedonistic wine instantly appeals to the senses. Editors' Choice."
US,87.0,30.0,Applegate Valley,Valley View,"Sweet, grapey fruit, plum and cherry, enhanced with peppery spice. The tannins are a bit ashy, but well integrated; with not too much oak. Overall, a balanced and elegant approach."
Spain,89.0,45.0,Arribes del Duero,MarquÃ©s de la Concordia,"The bouquet is dosed with resiny oak and vanilla aromas, but there are herbal notes, leather and red fruit scents as well. It feels good but slightly sticky, with flavors of vanilla, coconut, tomato, red plum and herb. This feels good on the finish, with tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors. Drink now through 2015."
Italy,86.0,10.0,Terre Siciliane,Tenute Orestiadi,"This informal red opens with muted aromas of spiced blueberry and mature blackberry. The simple, easy-drinking palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry and a hint of clove alongside soft, fleeting tannins. Drink now."
US,84.0,16.0,Calaveras County,Chatom Vineyards,"A light golden SB from Calaveras County with tons of tropical aromas, predominantly pineapple, that follow into the taste, which veers disproportionately sweet, with not enough acidity to balance it out."
US,87.0,85.0,Dundee Hills,Archery Summit,"The Red Hills Estate bottling sends a spicy note sailing out of the glass, with a pleasing follow-up of red currant, cherry, cinnamon and vanilla. Medium-bodied and displaying a core of tart fruit, this tails off into a tannic finish that needs a bit more polish."
US,88.0,29.0,Russian River Valley,Marimar Estate,"This is the producer's annual unoaked version of the variety, from its own estate, the grapes fermented entirely in stainless steel. Kept in tank until bottling, it's a fresh taste of spring, also showing green olive, quince and tropical mango, with plenty of juicy acidity."
US,90.0,40.0,Virginia,Barboursville Vineyards,"This Cabernet Sauvignon is subtle and restrained on first sniff, but only takes a few swirls to unlock its expressive aromas of blackberry, cassis, brown spice and undergrowth. Medium to full bodied, the palate bears seamless acidity and refined tannins. The finish shows some warmth, but mocha notes linger, creating balance."
Italy,85.0,16.0,Piave,Bellenda,"This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Caparzo,"This wine offers a full, bright bouquet that is packed with notes of cherry, chocolate, exotic spice, leather, rum cake and a touch of cinnamon. The palate shows smooth, fine tannins and a long, fruit-driven finish."
US,89.0,18.0,Rogue Valley,Valley View,"An appealing wine with notes of orange peel, citrus and red fruit. It's medium-bodied with lively citrus flavors that display a soft feel."
US,87.0,19.0,California,Kendall-Jackson,"A very nice Pinot Noir that's dry and silky, with satisfying cherry, cola, oak and spice flavors. Not one to age, but fine for drinking now, and easily as good as many Pinots costing more."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Mendoza,Alfredo Roca,"Dilute yet raisiny aromas struggle to stir interest. This wine feels wide and flat on the palate, with no real focal point. Chunky, slightly bitter flavors of apple skins and wood spice finish with a blast of oaky clove."
US,92.0,37.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"Acidity and minerality lend this Chardonnay a distinctive personality. The cool vintage has given it a certain lean appeal, but that's not to minimize the tropical fruit and sweet oak that give it richness. It's sleek, stylish and moderate in alcohol."
US,86.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,Macindoe,"Surprisingly mature in both color and flavor development, this mixes a flavor of rhubarb pie with brown sugar accents. Soft and approachable in style this should be consumed soon."
US,91.0,40.0,California,Miraflores,"Dark gold, almost chartreuse, this blend of SÃ©millon and Sauvignon Blanc has cider-like aromas at first and a slight effervescence. Balanced, it's interesting, a heady taste of apple and pear and almond that finishes clear and tight. It's a fine choice for fall and wintertime desserts but also as an apÃ©ritif."
Italy,95.0,62.0,Toscana,Felsina,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, it opens with fragrances that recall spicy black berries and Mediterranean herbs. The velvety palate delivers power and finesse along with fleshy black cherry, licorice and a graphite note. Wine Warehouse, Polaner Selections."
France,88.0,69.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau du Domaine de l'Eglise,"There is a good structure here, plenty to support the fresh fruits and red-berry flavors. This wine is full of fresh acidity with fruit and tannins in balance. It's going to develop well, always full of fruit and attractive acidity. Drink from 2018."
US,84.0,12.0,Mendocino County,Castle Rock,"A bit rough in texture and light in body, but offers a nice, silky texture and some ripe flavors of cherries, cola and spices."
France,90.0,30.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Pierre AndrÃ©,"Rich as well as structured, it's ripe and already delicious. Berry and cherry fruits are nicely surrounded by both acidity and tannins. Full in the mouth, it's going to be an estimable wine. Drink from 2017."
US,87.0,44.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Flying Goat Cellars,"Feels a bit heavy-handed, with forward, ripe flavors of cherries, root beer, currants, cedar and Asian spices. Could be going through an awkward phase. Made entirely from Dijon clone 667."
US,84.0,14.0,Napa Valley,Dominican Oaks,"Minty and green, with pronounced gooseberry and feline scent aromas and flavors. This bone-dry, acidic wine needs rich food for balance, like goat cheese."
US,92.0,52.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Siduri,"Adam Lee takes hold of one of the appellation's iconic vineyards and delivers clean, fresh aromas of mushrooms, raspberries, mocha and graphite. The palate shows soy, shiitake and more raspberry, an excellent study of the grape done in the Siduri style."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Luciana Cordioli,This is a light and informal Ripasso with plenty of sweet spice followed by bright blueberry and raspberry. There's a touch of sweetness in the mouth and vanilla bean flavors appear on the close.
US,92.0,48.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Waxwing,"Dark, tangy black-plum skin and tart boysenberry meet with purple flowers and rosemary on the nose of this bottling, which promises plenty of life in the cellar. The palate is lightly bodied but firmly structured, with tannic depth upholding the dark purple fruits and subtle black spice. These flavors will concentrate and intensify with time. Drink 2018??025."
France,95.0,200.0,LatriciÃ¨res-Chambertin,Alex Gambal,"Power and concentration exude from this wine. Very structured, very firm, it has solid tannins backed up by powerful black, juicy fruits. Blackberry flavors are still developing in this seriously ageworthy wine. Drink from 2020."
US,91.0,130.0,Napa Valley,Nickel & Nickel,"Named for nickel's number on the periodic table, this hillside vineyard site is located across Lake Hennessey on the eastern edge of the valley. Entirely varietal, it offers juicy layers highlighted in cedar, mountain sage and mellowed chocolate. The oak and tannin are well integrated and deeply embedded, providing support and structure."
US,94.0,55.0,Calistoga,Kenefick Ranch,"Young, intense and briary, with summer herb notes of anise framing ripe, spicy blackberries. Oak adds a rich, deft touch of sweet char. The tannins are considerable and brooding, giving this dry young wine an astringent tightness. Shows all the hallmarks of ageability. 45% Merlot, 43% Petit Verdot 7% Cabernet Franc, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon."
France,88.0,40.0,Champagne,Lombard et Cie,"Half and half Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this elegant wine comes from Premier Cru vineyards. It's soft and creamy, indicating a high dosage. That is balanced by the crisp fruit and bright acidity that gives the wine a lift. It is a fresh wine, probably best drunk young and fruity."
Italy,87.0,55.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Scagliola,"This leads with vanilla, ripe black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas. The firm palate delivers tobacco, licorice and black cherry jam flavors alongside chewy tannins. It finishes on an astringent note. Drink through 2019."
US,93.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),J. Bookwalter,"In an effort to further differentiate the Foreshadow Merlot from the Foreshadow Cabernet, winemaker John Bookwalter has kept each out of the other's blend. This is a riveting, complex, supersized wine, with alcohol over 15% and plenty of intriguing barrel flavors. The black cherry-berry fruit is swathed in spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee, complex and well-crafted."
US,90.0,46.0,Oakville,Venge,"Feels plush and important as soon as you taste it, not only for the ripe cherry, red currant, cola and spice flavors, but for the structure, which is dry and elegant. However, it's a very young wine, not ready to drink, although that won't stop many people from popping the cork now. Give it through the summer of 2009."
US,87.0,18.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"Shows the classic Kunde signature of pure, intense Merlot, at a good price. Soft and ripe with cherries, licorice and mocha, it's a gentle, easy wine to drink now."
US,86.0,14.0,Sonoma County,L de Lyeth,"Tough and gritty in the mouth, this has sandpapery, astringent tannins. While the fruit is ripe in blackberries, those tannins dominate. Barbecue will cut right through them."
US,90.0,48.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sineann,"Tarry and potent, with inky tannins, this single-vineyard Petit Verdot has an array of Amarone-like, superripe, spice-laced fruit. There is a whiff of leather as well. Drink up soon."
US,86.0,35.0,Los Carneros,Herencia,"Unctuous and made in a robust style, this wine offers a taste of caramel apple and hazelnut, with the illusion of sweetened oak amid a persistent finish."
US,86.0,14.0,California,Korbel,"Like the label says, this Pinot Noir-based blend of multiple varieties is sugary sweet, with raspberry, vanilla and toast flavors. It's a refreshing and easy to drink."
US,88.0,28.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Andrew Rich,"The aromas seem surprisingly subdued for the variety and style, with notes of flower, herb and spice. It drinks sweet but doesn't quite have the acid to back it up."
US,88.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Illahe,"This new vintage was barrel fermented, which fleshes out the flavors and brings some tropical notes along with the tart flavors of fresh pear. Young, sleek and showing a pleasing, wet stone minerality, this is styled for near-term enjoyment, perhaps with fresh halibut, swordfish or white salmon."
US,85.0,15.0,Central Coast,Mountain View,"Decent, everyday Pinot, with good varietal character, if not especially complex. The wine is dry, silky and crisp, with modest cherry and cola flavors."
US,90.0,22.0,Willamette Valley,Black Magnolia,"This has the pretty slightly candied flavors of a black-raspberry lifesaver, but with the extra dimensions of flavor that well-crafted wines provide. The acids are ample and the tannins light, but somehow this rather delicate wine carries gracefully on through a lingering layered finish. Nicely done, in a lovely package, and a fine value."
US,90.0,35.0,Umpqua Valley,Abacela,"The winery's 13th release of its flagship Tempranillo has notes of red fruit, savory spices and chocolaty oak accents (95% French, 20% new). The fruit flavors are soft with a velvety texture, surrounded by tightly coiled tannins and tart acidity."
Spain,86.0,27.0,Bierzo,Godelia,"To date, Godelia has done better with its MencÃ­a than Godello. This wine smells like pine, wheat and match stick, all aromas related to underripe fruit. A stalky, corny flavor profile lacks ripeness, a theme that's replayed on the finish."
US,89.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Paul Dolan,"Raspberry and blackberry aromas and ultraripe, opulent, jammy flavors fill the big, soft frame of this full-bodied wine. It has fruit in spades, milk chocolate and raspberry notes that linger on the finish, relatively light tannins and a touch of richness."
France,87.0,20.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Simard,"Juicy and fruity with acidity and black currant fruits, this wine comes from a vineyard on slopes at the entrance to Saint-Ãmilion. It's bright and fresh with lively, easy fruits and soft tannins. Drink from 2017."
US,87.0,41.0,Solano County,Putah Creek,"Simultaneously sweet and smoky aromas from the use of new oak mark this full-bodied wine. The fruit flavors resemble blackberry, the texture is broad and grippy with tannins and the finish is powerful with more oak sensations."
Spain,85.0,17.0,Valdeorras,Alan de Val,"Stalky, lightly medicinal aromas of berry fruits are a touch horsey. This feels chunky and a little lazy, with salty red-plum and currant flavors that finish long, lightly briny and herbal."
Italy,86.0,28.0,Sicilia,Mirabile,"Here's an interesting Sicilian expression of the French grape Tannat with black, inky aromas of soda, balsam, spice, mesquite and smoked ham. The wine closes with bright acidity and mouth-puckering astringency."
US,85.0,42.0,Santa Barbara County,Inocencio,"Heavy for a Pinot Noir, it's almost unrecognizable. While it is a nice, rustic red wine, dry and spicy, with lots of berry fruit, it's just not particularly Pinot-esque."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Frascati Superiore,Principe Pallavicini,"This lively white features aromas of tropical fruit, citrus and white flower.s The bright, round palate doles out fresh peach, juicy pineapple and crisp apple alongside zesty acidity."
France,95.0,150.0,Champagne,Bollinger,"Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine. It has great ripe swathes of peach and pineapple flavors, rounded by toast. While 2000 is not a vintage for aging, this opulent Champagne may be the exception."
US,88.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Siot,"Fresh-pressed blackberry aromas leap out of the glass of this wine, along with asphalt and a touch of purple flowers. The palate is a study of density and thickness, with black plums, coffee and espresso showing most out of the deep, black flavors."
France,89.0,33.0,Champagne,Pommery,"Fresh and lively in the nose, with proper toasty accents. Fairly full and complex flavors of honey, bread and minerals. Yeasty on the tail end, with lemon notes keeping it going. As a whole, it?s a nice, well-made quality Champagne."
Spain,90.0,17.0,Rioja,Burgo Viejo,"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel. Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise."
Italy,85.0,25.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Poggio Alloro,"Fermented and aged in new barriques, this deeply golden-colored wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, vanilla bean and oak-driven spices that carry over to the palate. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak and racy acidity, giving it a lean character."
US,89.0,32.0,Yorkville Highlands,Bink,"While thick and dark, this brawny Syrah is elegantly structured, firm, and aged enough to be a wise choice with food. It tastes of wild blackberry?just picked?dripping off the vines."
France,87.0,23.0,Alsace,Domaine Pfister,"A delicately fruity, fresh wine, this is very refreshing with its crisp acidity and citrus flavors. It's linear in focus with a lively, light aftertaste. It's ready to drink."
Italy,86.0,11.0,Sicilia,Caruso & Minini,"Yellow flower and natural rubber come forward first and are followed by peach, apricot, pear and delicate mineral nuances. There's a creamy, warm quality to the mouthfeel, but this bright Inzolia ends clean and fresh."
Italy,85.0,13.0,Falerio,Le Corti dei Farfensi,"Made from the native Pecorino grape, this has pretty floral aromas that mingle with bright sensations of tropical fruit and citrus. It's simple but well constructed and enjoyable."
US,93.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Kaleidos,"This blend of 64% Syrah, 26% Grenache and 10% MourvÃ¨dre is unabashedly rich and lush, with cassis, vanilla, baked pastry, white chocolate, brown sugar and caramelized pork fat on the nose. Fudge, caramel and vanilla show powerfully on the sip, which will pair with a juicy steak or simply wow everyone at the table, even toward the end of a long night."
France,95.0,80.0,Champagne,Louis Roederer,"Beautifully crisp and fresh, this is a young, tightly textured wine that is already so refreshing. Its red fruit character is just a part of the mineral and tannin texture and the pure line of fragrant acidity. Very pale in color, this sophisticated wine could do with some aging. Drink from 2018."
France,90.0,19.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"A lovely ethereal lift of lemon balm hovers over ripe peach notes on the nose. The dry palate brings in lots of lemon freshness as well as tangy grapefruit. The finish is spicy, clean and utterly refreshing."
Australia,89.0,25.0,Margaret River,Howard Park,"Its pale-gold color gives this rich, oaky style away. Lemon, green papaya, mint, nuts and wet stone all mingle with tongue-tingling acidity. The palate is on the lean and mean side at the moment, and the oak sticks out too, but there's a redeeming smokey, mineral finish and the hope that all will settle with time. Drink now??025."
US,90.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Burgess,"From a high perch on Howell Mountain, this producer has blended 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 8% Petit Verdot?making for a darkly colored, robust wine. Thick, chalky tannins envelop plum, cassis and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2020."
US,87.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Kendall-Jackson,"This has polished blackberry and black currant flavors, touched with oak. It shows real elegance and class."
France,88.0,35.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Doudet Naudin,"This has a strong steely, mineral character. It offers plenty of citrus and green plum but, at this young stage, the wine is more about crisp texture. The aftertaste hints at the future, ripe and warm. Drink from 2017."
France,84.0,19.0,Vin de Savoie,Les Rocailles,"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016."
France,88.0,16.0,Ile de BeautÃ©,Domaine Poli,"This wine is poised, balancing crisp acidity with ripe red fruit. That tension gives it a great lift, brightening its tight texture and background richness. Drink now."
US,93.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Whitehall Lane,"Aloof now, this Cab holds you at a distance with its provocative tannins. But it's a very fine wine that shows real Napa pedigree. Balanced and harmonious, it features complex flavors of blackberries, cassis and cedar wood that turn sweet on the finish. Should be at its best between 2010 and 2013 and then slowly fade away."
US,84.0,14.0,Santa Ynez Valley,EOS,"Vague apple, pear and lime pith aromas show on the subdued nose of this bottling. The palate is pleasant, with dried apple, lime peel and grass flavors, but it's somewhat lacking in energy."
US,83.0,27.0,New Mexico,VivÃ¡c Winery,"Spiced meats, cherry and pepper give this plucky red a food-friendly edge. On the palate, it's spicy and slightly tart, with cranberry, blueberry and crushed herbs. Earthy and dry, the wine will pair well with spiced meat and pastas."
Australia,87.0,10.0,South Australia,Oxford Landing,"Despite its modest alcohol level, this doesn't come across as lean or undernourished. Instead, it delivers a fair bit of weight (is there some residual sugar?), green fruit flavors of apples, figs and limes, and a lime-zest finish. Drink now."
US,89.0,46.0,Red Mountain,The Walls,"This wine is half Grenache, with the balance MourvÃ¨dre (31%), Syrah (14%) and Counoise. Lighter in color, it brings aromas of cranberry, cherry, spice, smoked meat and herb. The tart cranberry flavors are full bodied, showing a sense of purity and balance, pulling up a bit on the finish."
US,88.0,38.0,Monterey County,House Family Vineyards,"Sour citrus aromas meet with dried honeysuckle and tuberose scents on the nose of this bottling. The palate is peppery and zesty with lime and lemon peel, plus touches of lemograss and white pepper, traversing the greener side of the Chardonnay spectrum."
US,94.0,52.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Melville,"In a grand tasting of new Pinot Noirs from the appellation, this bottle stood out, even among its renowned peers. Spectacularly complex, it offers a wealth of cherries, currants, orange zest, plum, fig, tea, clove and cinnamon flavors that, for all their power, never lose a sense of elegance and purity. Practically a food group of its own, this is a great California Pinot Noir."
US,84.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Great Sage,"This somewhat flat, green and tannic wine is reduced and sour in tone, with medium body and broad acidity."
US,93.0,85.0,Santa Maria Valley,Challen,"This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Zenato,"Aromas of black currant, blue flower, tilled soil, menthol and cedar take center stage. The dense palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, vanilla, nutmeg and a confectionery note. Velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2022."
France,87.0,32.0,Chablis,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Light and fruity, this is an attractive, rounded wine. With its bright acidity, touch of minerality and orange-peel flavor, it is open and ready to drink."
France,92.0,38.0,Sancerre,Domaine Vacheron,"Highly reputed for its red wines, Vacheron continues to display its skills with this latest vintage. The wine is rich and full with a combination of bright red fruits and a firm, integrated structure. It is a fresh wine now and one that should age. Drink from 2018."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Sicilia,Cusumano,"Pinot Nero in Sicily either works or it doesn't. This one does. The wine shows aromas of wild berry, peppermint, chopped mint, white cherry and red rose."
US,84.0,17.0,Sonoma County,Chloe,"Aged in both French and American oak, this is a tropical and oaky expression of the grape, round and slightly sweetened atop a silkiness of smooth butter."
US,85.0,38.0,Dry Creek Valley,Saini,"Made in a soft, sweet style, this Zin has raspberry and cherry pie flavors. It's classic Dry Creek Zin in its own way, with a hearty rusticity that calls for barbecue, roasted chicken, pasta with lots of marinara sauce and cheese."
US,86.0,7.0,California,Three Thieves,"Deep in color, big in flavor and full bodied, this is a rustic, straightforward wine. It smells like very ripe blackberry and black cherry, tastes dense and feels full, tannic and firm-textured."
US,91.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Bynum,"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety."
US,89.0,39.0,Ribbon Ridge,Chehalem,"Packaged in a plain, stylish bottle with the RR logo prominently displayed, this reserve-level cuvÃ©e brings concentrated flavors of citrus, apple, peach and pear, along with highlights of wet paper, fresh herb and lemongrass. Despite 12 g/L of residual sugar, the finish tilts a bit sour."
US,83.0,12.0,Monterey County,Castle Rock,"Simple, with cherry jam, mint and cola flavors. Crisp coastal acidity makes it mouthwatering."
US,90.0,60.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Torii Mor,"Aggressively herbal, dark and slatey, this arresting Pinot Noir is distinctive and powerful; it won't appeal to everyone, but those who like it will appreciate its uniqueness. There is an impression of clay and a hardness to the fruit, but it's compact enough to suggest a reasonably long life ahead."
US,92.0,40.0,Yakima Valley,Doyenne,"This opens with deep, dense dark-fruit goodness. It's a massive wine that bursts with blackberry, black cherry and cassis. After that opening explosion of ripe fruit, it seems to float through the mouth, like riding in a big-finned Cadillac from the 1950s. Consume this one within 2?? years."
US,88.0,20.0,Red Mountain,Hightower,"This is all estate-grown from the original (2004) planting. Tannins are smooth and the wine has a pleasing chocolate streak upon entry. Peppery and herbal highlights come into play through the finish, which firms up nicely."
US,85.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Lucas & Lewellen,"Shows ripe, forward raspberry and cherry jam flavors, wrapped in a silky texture brightened by crisp acidity. Feels a bit rugged, though, with a green sharpness throughout. Drink up."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Soave Classico,Cantina di Monteforte,"This pretty white wine would pair perfectly with salads, fresh water fish or grilled tuna. Stone fruit and honeydew melon give it a clean and lively mouthfeel."
US,95.0,65.0,Sonoma Coast,Ramey,"Not many producers get fruit from this magical vineyard, sought after for being cool, coastal and meticulously farmed. This wine speaks to all that, offering sublime Meyer lemon, pear and golden honey around a balanced soul and wild ginger-infused intensity."
Spain,92.0,28.0,EmpordÃ ,Perelada,"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025."
US,84.0,13.0,California,Girl Go Lightly,"The alcohol is a low 11% by volume, but the cost is lots of residual sugar. Shows very sweet, simple tropical fruit, peach and honey flavors."
US,84.0,36.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Grochau,"This wine seems to be a casualty of the cold vintage, with thin fruit and overall earthy flavors. A whiff of barnyard is evident as well."
US,90.0,55.0,Paso Robles,LXV,"Plump and inviting black cherry fruit melds with char, soy and purple flower aromas on the nose of this atypical blend of 38% Syrah, 31% Cabernet Franc and 31% Merlot. The wine is cohesive on the palate, with persistent tannins and smoke, coffee, red fruit and dried herb flavors."
US,90.0,44.0,Dundee Hills,Vista Hills,"Vista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Toscana,Michele Satta,"Light garnet in color, this wine has a subtle bouquet that is redolent of blue flower, almond paste, tobacco and even citrus. The palate feels tight and crisp."
Italy,96.0,199.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Biondi Santi,"Underbrush, ripe berry, new leather and Mediterranean herb aromas slowly take shape in the glass. Showing youthful tension, the vibrant palate delivers red cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and pipe tobacco notes framed by bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. It already shows great balance and finesse but is still young and tight. Drink 2022??035."
Italy,91.0,35.0,Chianti Classico,Castellare di Castellina,"This savory blend of 95% Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo leads with earthy aromas of freshly tilled soil, underbrush, black berries and plum. The vibrant, structured palate offers sour cherry layered with white pepper, thyme and sage balanced by fresh acidity and a solidly tannic backbone. Hold to develop complexity. Drink 2015??020."
US,87.0,20.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Storm,"This Sauvignon Blanc has so much acidity, it's almost sparkling. While not unpleasant, this has to be regarded as a fault, which detracts from the score. Aside from that, the citrus, tropical fruit, honey and gooseberry flavors are delicious."
US,90.0,44.0,Santa Barbara County,Epiphany,"Concentrated violet aromas mix with dark blackberry and even blueberry fruit in this blend of 46% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah, yet it remains quite fresh on the nose. The palate shows hibiscus, more aromatic blueberry elements and touches of cassis and vanilla."
Italy,90.0,89.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Avignonesi,"Ripe plum, coconut, vanilla and French oak aromas lead the nose. Youthfully assertive and austere, the palate offers toasted oak, licorice and espresso notes, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that grip the finish. That structure should mellow and integrate with a few more years of bottle age."
US,93.0,49.0,Anderson Valley,MacPhail,"Extraordinarily rich, this Pinot Noir dazzles with extracted cherries and raspberries, with exotic mulberry additions that have a spicy, feral, meaty quality. Top Anderson Valley vineyards often show this wild note, so welcome in an era when ripe fruit is easy to achieve. On a par with MacPhail's great 2007 Frattey Shams bottling, and the good news for consumers is that they've lowered the price considerably. Drink now??016."
France,87.0,25.0,Chablis,Etienne Boileau,"Showing the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a soft rounded wine. It has attractive acidity to lift the ripe yellow fruit and add a shot of citrus. The wine needs another few months to settle in, so wait until summer 2017."
France,89.0,31.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Haut Beyzac,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, which reveals great structure to go with its black berry fruits. American Daren Miller, married to a Bordeaux native, has been involved in the restoration of this property in the MÃ©doc, producing a classic wine, that pays great respect to its origins."
US,85.0,11.0,California,Beaulieu Vineyard,"Here's a Pinot with some varietal character, namely silky tannins, soft acids, and flavors of cherries and cola. Goes the extra mile with some additional depth of flavor and pretty oak, but it's awfully hard to get a good Pinot at this price."
US,86.0,20.0,Red Mountain,Finn Hill,"This wine is light cherry-red in color, showing some bricking. Strawberry, bubble gum and orange-peel aromas are followed by off-dry flavors with a broad feel."
US,88.0,65.0,Carneros-Napa Valley,Robert Mondavi,"Cherry compote and a flair of kirsch preside over well-tended acidity in this full-bodied wine. Earthy lavender and herb give the wine an ethereal character atop solid, velvety texture and a big oak finish."
US,92.0,35.0,Sonoma County,Sebastiani,"Made mostly with Bordeaux varieties based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with a dash of Syrah, this is a fine wine. It's dry, full-bodied and packed with blackberry, cassis, bacon and spice flavors, leading to a long, impressive finish. Give it a decant and enjoy as it warms in the glass."
France,90.0,19.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Charmail,"Unusually for the MÃ©doc, this wine has a significant percentage (14.5%) of Cabernet Franc as well as 12.5% Petit Verdot. These two grapes give the wine its perfume and its dark color. They add to the rich tannins and juicy black currants that pack the wine. Drink this fine wine from 2020."
US,92.0,30.0,Sierra Foothills,La Folia Winery,"A buzz is building around Calaveras County-based La Folia, and this lovely wine shows why. Opening with a subtle oaky aroma, it evolves to offer a lightness of color and texture, enveloped by delicious highlights of cherry and cranberry fruit. Well integrated and well structured, this Sangiovese ends with a long and satisfying finish of violet-inflected plum."
Australia,90.0,50.0,Clarendon,Joseph,"From a top subsection of McLaren Vale, this well-crafted Shiraz features a nice balance of sweet and savory notes. Ripe blackberry and plum flavors are matched by nuances of cedar, spice and meat. This creamy-textured Shiraz seems to be already approaching maturity; drink it now through 2012."
US,87.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Kuleto Estate,"This Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, in roughly equal proportions, is soft and sweet in black currants, dark chocolate, beef jerky and new oak flavors, wrapped into strong but pliable tannins. Drink now."
US,85.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"Some light Graham cracker aromas come up quickly, but in the mouth the wine all but disappears. Watery and thin, it shows little promise of further improvement."
France,93.0,135.0,Champagne,Ruinart,"The wine has a toasty character showing that it has considerable bottle age. The fruit has moved into the realm of secondary flavors with almonds, fresh bread and spice flavors. It is a delicious wine for those who like more mature Champagnes."
US,88.0,26.0,Temecula Valley,Robert Renzoni,"This is a fruity, tropical rendition of grape, showing guava, papaya, coconut and apple aromas on the nose. The palate packs loads of floral character, with more tropical fruit and bubblegum-like flavors that feel ripe but not sweet."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Sicilia,Cottanera,"Barbazzale, from a winery located on the charred, mineral-rich slopes of Mount Etna, is a beautifully pristine expression of Inzolia with distinct aromas of stone fruit, white stone and dried chamomile flower."
Argentina,89.0,80.0,Mendoza,Cheval des Andes,"A touch saucy on the nose, with tomato and herbal aromas infiltrating baked berry fruit scents. Feels fresh and clacky, with less extract and body than in the past but also more elegance. Tastes snappy and mildly herbal, with a juicy, slightly lean finish. Food friendly; drink now through 2013."
US,88.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Keenan,"Keenan has a good track record with Merlot, and here's a lovely one. It's softly approachable despite firm tannins, with flavors of cherries, blackberries and cola, and an earthy note that suggests mushroom risotto."
France,86.0,30.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Latour-Martillac,"This wine is dry, dominated by the new-wood flavors and toasty character that hide any fruit. The lean structure will probably remain. The property is owned by the Kressmann family."
US,92.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Harmony Cellars,"The impressive nose on this blend offers aromas of tobacco, beef jerky, oregano, thyme, chocolate, coffee and dark earth against a blueberry-liqueur backbone. A bumping acidity unleashes flavors of plum and purple flowers on the palate, which also shows espresso and blackberry tang, carrying deep into the finish."
Italy,89.0,10.0,Sicilia,Stemmari,"Alluring aromas of citrus, white flower and a whiff of tropical fruit come together on this. The racy palate offers lemon zest, mango, sage, saline and an almond note alongside vibrant acidity."
France,94.0,286.0,Champagne,Ruinart,"From a great Champagne vintage, this rich, full-bodied wine is just beginning to develop secondary flavors, toast and walnuts. The red fruits are fading into the background, while keeping the acidity in place. It is ripe, well balanced and has a delicious, long aftertaste. It is ready to drink."
US,92.0,35.0,North Fork of Long Island,Anthony Nappa,"Blackberry and raspberry flavors are ripe and juicy yet invigoratingly crisp in this elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Subdued spice and perfumed violet notes enhance bold berry flavors on the midpalate. A well-integrated package with finely textured tannins, it's ready to drink now but should improve through 2025."
Italy,91.0,95.0,Barolo,Parusso,"Exotic spice, vanilla, dark-skinned fruit and French oak aromas lift out of the glass. The palate shows toasted oak, coconut, espresso raspberry and cherry alongside tight close-grained tannins that grip the austere finish. It's still on its oak so give it time to come around. Drink after 2023."
France,89.0,40.0,Auxey-Duresses,Henri de Villamont,"This demonstrates a good balance between minerality and ripe pineapple and apricot fruits. With a twist of lemon and an herb accent, it has both crispness and richness."
France,86.0,10.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Barton & Guestier,"The blend of Sauvignon Blanc and SÃ©millon has produced an attractive, fruity wine that's young and fresh. Light and bright, with delicious final acidity, its structure suggests it could age; drink from the end of 2015."
France,91.0,60.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Laur,"Very young, this is currently all about juicy black fruits and accompanying tannins. It should develop well to give a richly structured wine that has both fruits and a dark, mineral character, hinting at wood aging. Drink from 2018."
US,87.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Basel Cellars,"Already a full five-years-old, this cool vintage wine brings aromas of freshly brewed coffee, baking spice, vanilla, green herb and tobacco. The flavors are light and elegant, showing a pretty styling but the concentration doesn't always seem fully there."
Italy,88.0,28.0,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,Speri,"Speri's Ripasso has an added layer of spice, vanilla and other oak-generated aromas that distinguish it. There's a juicy core of fruit there too: black cherry, plums and white raisin. Drink this wine with meat-filled ravioli or wild mushrooms."
US,91.0,55.0,Sonoma Coast,Migration,"This richly concentrated wine surprises in its uplifting acidity on the back of the palate. Light, bright and full of Gravenstein apple goodness, it is well structured and refreshingly unfussy."
US,93.0,80.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"Silky and voluptuous, Gowan Creek is Goldeneye's larger production Anderson Valley Pinot Noir. Still a barrel selection of its best lots, the wine is made from fruit that's heavily scrutinized before fermentation. A powerful Pinot that retains the acidity and earthiness of the variety, with streaks of ripe fruit throughout."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Rioja,ViÃ±a Salceda,"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,ValdellÃ¶vo,"White flowers, green apple, pear, lime and mineral notes come together on this linear, lightly sparkling wine. Refermenting in the bottle on its yeasts gives it a slightly cloudy appearance and a fine sediment at the bottom. It has a dry, almost austere finish."
US,84.0,22.0,Monterey County,Hearst Ranch,"Made in the modern style with buttered toast, buttered popcorn, butterscotch and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps provide balance."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Castello Romitorio,"From one of the most beautiful wine properties in Tuscany (owned by artist Sandro Chia and managed by his son Filippo), this gorgeous Brunello shows elegance, pedigree and quality fruit. Blackberry and bright cherry are backed by warmer tones of tobacco and cigar box. There's ageworthy structure and freshness too."
Australia,82.0,20.0,Pemberton,Salitage,"Seems prematurely aged, with slight bricking already apparent at the rim and leafy, tomatoey aromas and flavors. Not bad, just old before its time."
US,86.0,18.0,Napa Valley,Whitehall Lane,"This is a softly gentle wine, with a drop of SÃ©millon contributing an oily, cashew earthiness to Sauvignon's citrus and tropical fruit flavors."
US,87.0,18.0,Dry Creek Valley,Truett Hurst,"Meaty, dry and balanced yet big, this is a substantial mouthful of RosÃ©. Made from Dry Creek Zinfandel with 12% Syrah, it's brooding in dark berry and peach fruit and can be paired much as a full-bodied red wine would be."
Italy,84.0,16.0,Moscato d'Asti,Castello del Poggio,"Fragrant and tight with a pretty aromatic ensemble of peach, honey and flowers, this is a perfect match to fruit tarts and ice cream. The wine is soft and creamy in the mouth with delicate effervescence and lingering sweetness."
France,86.0,16.0,Beaujolais,Domaine de la PrÃ©bende,"This crisp wine brings out good flavor depth from the cherry and red-berry fruits. It is concentrated for a simple Beaujolais, ripe and fruity, Drink now."
Italy,90.0,38.0,Barolo,Podere Ruggeri Corsini,"This opens with aromas of camphor, dried herb and red berry while the firm palate shows black licorice, peppercorn, sour cherry and a hint of tobacco. A backbone of assertive tannins provides structure. Drink after 2020."
US,87.0,60.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Babcock,"Was it the chilly vintage that made this wine so elusive? Tasted in the spring, it was oaky and jammy with raspberries and cherries, with the astringent tannins of green herb tea. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere, but it does have dryness and vital acidity in its favor."
Argentina,85.0,15.0,NeuquÃ©n,Alpataco,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come."
France,93.0,80.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau Lynch-Moussas,"One of the chateaus owned by nÃ©gociant Borie-Manoux, Lynch-Moussas has produced a fine, stylish 2010, which is firmly based on Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is rich and ripe, dominated by a blackberry note and underpinned by tannins. This is a chateau to watch."
Italy,89.0,50.0,Barolo,Dosio,"Aromas of wild berry, menthol, baking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. On the tightly wound palate, bracing tannins support raw cherry, anise, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside firm acidity."
US,92.0,26.0,El Dorado,Boeger,"Lively, spicy and warm, this full-bodied wine wraps firm tannins around flavors like mulled berries and preserved cherries, though it's also surprisingly fresh and vibrant. After baking spices, mellow fruit comes through on the palate, while the firm texture really keeps it going on the finish."
US,87.0,28.0,North Coast,Stargazer Barn,"Very focused and vibrant, this wine has plenty of good acidity that lends a crisp mouthfeel, along with fresh and buoyant flavors of red cherry and cranberry that are nicely concentrated. Moderate tannins add to the grippy texture, and will make this wine work well with rich foods."
Italy,88.0,37.0,Toscana,Ambrogio e Giovanni Folonari,"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of toast and whiffs of banana and mango. The aromas carry on to the palate along with a creamy hint of butter."
US,84.0,14.0,Russian River Valley,Angeline,"The price is right, but the wine is ordinary. It's a modest little Pinot Noir, silky and dry, with suggestions of cherries, tangerine peel and cola."
US,88.0,41.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Northstar,"Coming from two of the state's finest vineyards?Cold Creek and Klipsun?this cool-vintage, 100% varietal wine shows an unusual Washington Cabernet profile of blueberry and plum along with herbs and a kiss of vanilla. It's soft and supple in feel with elegant coffee and blue fruit flavors."
US,86.0,25.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Methven Family Vineyards,"In general, Eola Hills Pinots lean more to the peppery and herbal side of the line, compared with pricier AVAs in Yamhill county. This well-made wine shows good color and concentration, and it's ripe enough that the herbaceousness is a feature, if not entirely an asset. There's a nice lift to the midpalate, which leaves a residual impression that finishes a bit vinegary, as the wine winds down into flavors of black olive and herb."
Spain,90.0,22.0,Rioja,Solar de Castro,"Aromas of minerally pencil lead and smoky plum and berry are positive albeit oaky. This is tight and grabby in feel, with firm tannins. Plum and berry flavors offer more than enough oaky support, while the finish is dominated by wood-spice notes and bulky tannins. Drink through 2021."
Italy,91.0,30.0,Alto Adige,Tiefenbrunner,"This opens with aromas of chamomile flower, crushed tomato vine and cut grass. The vibrant elegant palate delivers white peach, grapefruit, chopped herb and lemon zest alongside racy acidity."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Bolgheri,Giorgio Meletti Cavallari,"This wine is not as bulky or dense as others from Bolgheri and boasts a more austere, yet elegant nose. But there's character and depth here thanks to its chewy tannins and long cherry finish."
France,94.0,90.0,ChÃ¢teau-Chalon,Domaine Berthet-Bondet,"The ChÃ¢teau-Chalon appellation can only make vin jaune and this exceptional example shows why this type of wine is unique. Balanced acids and fragrant fruitiness underpin the yeast, almond flavors and freshness. It is ready to drink in all its glory but will age for many, many years."
Italy,89.0,12.0,Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro,Zanasi,"This wine's fragrant blue flower and red berry aromas lift out of the glass. On the savory palate, ground clove accents raspberry jam and wild cherry notes, all hemmed in with refined tannins."
US,89.0,40.0,Dundee Hills,Purple Hands,"This feels a little thin at first sip, but it's balanced and shows tart cherry fruit that has attained a modest level of ripeness. It has a pleasing softness in the mouth, opening into a mix of plum and red cherry, with some phenolic bite."
US,86.0,10.0,California,Dark Horse,A streak of vanilla winds through the almost-sweet fruit flavors of this medium-bodied and soft-textured wine. Ripe cherry aromas and strawberry jam flavors come with very little tannin and low acidity.
US,88.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),GÃ¥rd,"Aromas of spice, apricot, and Creamsicle are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors, showing some warmth on the finish."
US,87.0,26.0,Bennett Valley,Frostwatch,"Crushed peppercorn aromas mark this dry, full-bodied Zin, along with all sorts of other racy spices. The alcohol is moderate, and the flavors kick in midpalate, suggesting berries, currants, tobacco, leather and coffee. A very nice example of a balanced, Sonoma Zinfandel with classic elegance."
US,87.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,Rumpus,"A fine AlbariÃ±o, this is brisk in acidity, moderate in alcohol and clean on the finish. Shows flavors of citrus fruits and minerals, with rich notes of pears. Great to drink now."
US,84.0,32.0,Paso Robles,Proulx,"This bottling starts with a pretty nose of peach, melon and nectarine. It's more about the crisp, refreshing mouthfeel than anything, and would partner well with lightly seasoned shellfish or soft cheese."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,Le Bertille,"Made from a blend of Sangiovese, Colorino, Canaiolo and Ciliegiolo, this vibrant Rosso has sensations of black plum, ripe sour cherry, baking spices and Mediterranean herbs. The palate delivers brisk acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy it soon with substantial first courses like pasta topped with meat sauce or four-cheese gnocchi."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Casarena,"Floral berry and plum aromas are also saucy and oaky, and thus discordant. A wobbly tannic palate with green herbal oaky blueberry flavors tastes grassy on the finish. If you know Casarena's wines, this fits the mold."
Italy,91.0,30.0,Alto Adige,Gump Markus Prackwieser,"Enticing aromas of Alpine wildflower, rennet apple and a whiff of aromatic herb unfold on this sleek, radiant white. The vibrant, elegant palate offers creamy Anjou pear, white peach and lemon-lime energized by a mineral vein and firm acidity."
US,86.0,25.0,Napa Valley,St. SupÃ©ry,"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mÃ©lange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish."
France,90.0,50.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau EugÃ©nie,"Densely structured and full of dusty tannins as well as perfumed black fruits, this wine is named after Russian Tsar Peter the Great. With its crisp acidity and powerful dry core, it needs to age, so drink from 2019."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Cicchitti,"Dark, gummy and full of heavily applied green oak, this wine has a candied, murky, resiny persona. And that's too bad, because it has potential; yet the tannins, wood resin, mesquite and beefy black fruit are all too dominant and thus it never settles or shows much harmony."
France,91.0,18.0,Muscadet CÃ´tes de Grandlieu,Domaine de l'AujardiÃ¨re,"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the SÃ¨vre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this. This wine is ripe, with hints of toast and vanilla as well as fresh and crisp apple acidity. It's a full-bodied, rounded wine that is just ready to drink and will be better from 2016."
US,87.0,22.0,Paso Robles,Martin & Weyrich,"Bright, brash fruit sets this off on the right note, with raspberries and strawberries and even a little watermelon in the mix. Fruit defines the middle, and extends through to the full, ripe finish."
US,87.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,Merriam,"This simple wine has juicy blueberry and baked cherry flavors at its core, a lushness on the palate that is supported by firm tannins and oak."
US,89.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Broken Earth,"Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level."
Italy,87.0,60.0,Barolo,Stroppiana,"This opens with subdued aromas of dark berry, scorched earth, grilled porcini and a whiff of leather. The palate offers sour cherry, sage and a hint of cured meat alongside raspy tannins that give it a grainy finish."
US,82.0,35.0,South Coast,Orfila,"A tannic blend of Montepulciano, Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is closed in the nose and dense in texture."
France,93.0,100.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"A wine with great sweet fruits along with smoky, firm tannins. It is certainly structured, and the black jelly fruits are already delicious. Weight partners with acidity, creating a combination of freshness and richness at the end. Drink from 2018."
US,87.0,46.0,Mendocino County,J. Jacaman,"Made from a mountain vineyard close to the ocean, in an area that doesn't yet have its own appellation, this dry, crisp Pinot resembles a warmer Russian River bottling. It's ripe in jammy cherry and currant flavors that finish firmly tannic."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Campania,Villa Matilde,"Bright and crisp, this Aglianico-based rosato shows the soft, feminine side of this hearty red grape. Notes of wild berry and raspberry are followed by touches of almond skin and pink grapefruit."
US,88.0,50.0,Carneros,Kazmer & Blaise,"Oak stands out, making smoky caramel and butterscotch the dominant flavors in this Chardonnay. Below that are fruity flavors of pineapples, green apple jam and peach preserves, finished with awesome Asian spices. Just 90 cases produced."
France,86.0,23.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine Carrette,"This soft, ripe wine is still developing its rich white fruitiness. For now, it's poised between acidity and a mineral structure. The creamier aspect of this wine is still to come, so keep until 2016."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Terre Nere di Campigli - Vallone,"Dark fruit, prune, cured meat, tobacco and leather are followed by accents of strawberry or blackberry jelly. There's a ripe quality to the fruit here that is followed by spicy oak and thick concentration. The presentation is easy and soft."
France,85.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau l'Orangerie,"All tangy fruit, this simple wine is light, with citrus and crisp pear flavors. A touch of honey adds a soft side while keeping its zesty fruit right in place. Drink now."
France,84.0,20.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"Fairly deep in color for a sparkling rosÃ©, Sparr's Brut RosÃ© offers bold, berry-like aromas with hints of spring flowers and a plump, slightly corpulent feel in the mouth. The flavors are a bit rustic, with hints of underbrush and scorched earth."
US,90.0,42.0,Sonoma Valley,Ram's Gate,"Fruit is sourced from Bismark Vineyard in the Moon Mountain District. Compared with the winery's Winemaker's CuvÃ©e, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon (83%) with a larger percentage of Malbec (17%). It spends the same amount of time?two years?in French oak, but slightly less of it is new. The flavors are more approachable, still dark, massive and spicy, the taste of oak slightly sweet."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Collio,Primosic,"Aromas of pressed white flower, stone fruit and chopped herb lead the nose. On the vibrant palate, crisp acidity brightens creamy white peach, passion fruit, sage and mineral."
US,90.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture."
France,87.0,42.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaines Ott,"A pale salmon colored rosÃ©, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers scents of honeydew, red berries, peach and crushed stones and flavors to match. The only quibble is that it finishes a little abruptly. This is very good, but consumers should be on the lookout for the fresher 2007."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Soave,La Cappuccina,"Aromas of honeysuckle and orchard fruit lead the nose. The fruity palate doles out white peach, green apple and a hint of white almond alongside lively acidity. A mineral note signals the close."
US,86.0,50.0,Napa Valley,World's End,"Dry, tannic and bursting in dusty red fruit, this is a majority varietal with 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Brawny and broodingly full bodied, it finishes leathery and smoky."
US,87.0,30.0,Yorkville Highlands,Yorkville Cellars,"Grown primarily in Chile these days, CarmenÃ¨re can be akin to Merlot, though this version has the herbal qualities of a Cab Franc and is otherwise quite oaky."
US,90.0,40.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"From the producer's family estate, this reserve white is golden in color and appropriately rich in crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and butterscotch, yet balanced and firm. Creamy, it offers flavors and aromas of lush melon and orange, finishing with sumptuous vanilla."
US,85.0,18.0,Yorkville Highlands,Yorkville Cellars,"From a Mendocino producer who defends this appellation as Bordeaux country, a rather rough wine, compared to its southerly neighbors from Napa and Sonoma. Blackberry fruit barely ripened, and there are green, stalky flavors in this dry, fairly tannic wine."
US,87.0,13.0,Sonoma County,Chateau St. Jean,"A pleasant wine, with mild melon, mineral, citrus, peach and herb flavors. Light textured, medium bodied and quite refreshing. Clean on the finish."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Mirassou,"Lots of Anjou pear and Fuji apple flavors enrich this medium-bodied and refreshing wine. It has a light straw color and open flavors of ripe fruit and citrus. The texture is very smooth, and the finish has a touch of ripe-fruit sweetness."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Pe're Alessandro,"Easy, bright and sweet smelling, this vibrant Dolcetto offers an informal drinking match to home-cooked pasta and light meat dishes. The wine is soft and plush with firm structure."
Italy,92.0,43.0,Barolo,Paolo Scavino,"Dark-skinned berry, baking spice and floral aromas float from the glass while the taut palate delivers crushed raspberry, licorice and chopped herb. Firm refined tannins provide the backbone. Drink 2020??027."
US,87.0,50.0,Spring Mountain District,Vineyard 7&8,"The winery has been doing a great job with their Chard lately. It's a mountain wine and shows typical concentration, with very pure, ripe flavors of peaches, pears and pineapples. It's right up there at the threshold of too oaky and sweet, though it stops just short."
Italy,95.0,120.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Lazzeretti,"Inviting aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, new leather, pressed blue flower, mint, cake spice and a balsamic note meld together on this delicious, impressive red. The velvety full-bodied palate provides layers of succulent wild cherry, crushed raspberry, truffle, licorice and cinnamon. Firm, polished tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018??025."
US,92.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Mi SueÃ±o,"Here's a fine, young Cabernet, rich in pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, cassis and sweet toasted oak notes. Already throwing some sediment, it should glide effortlessly through the next eight years, gaining bottle interest."
US,86.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Pali,"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now."
US,92.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Riverbench,"Hay yellow in color, with a wispy shade of pink in the core, this bubbly shows aromas of lemon chiffon, sourdough toast, white peach and a touch of quinine on the nose. Lemon peel and curd show strongly on the palate, laid across a salted cracker flavor?quite delicious and refreshing at once."
France,87.0,18.0,Cheverny,BenoÃ®t Daridan,"Made from Pinot Noir, this fresh and light rosÃ© is packed with red berries and lively acidity. It is perfumed, dry and very fruity. Drink now."
Canada,92.0,77.0,Niagara Peninsula,Inniskillin,"Harvested at 40.16 Brix and retaining a whopping 255 g/L residual sugar, this wine shows a complex medley of notes ranging from fresh baked apple pie to apricot and cinnamon. It's thick and rich in feel with stone fruit and dried orange rind flavors persisting through the long-drawn-out finish."
US,93.0,70.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Cattleya,"Baked blackberry, vanilla, caramel and tar on the nose make for a very inviting entry into this rich Syrah from Bibiana GonzÃ¡lez Rave, whose father-in-law, Gary Pisoni, co-developed this vineyard. A firm structure to the sip gives backbone to the lush flavors of dark berry, purple flowers, smoky campfire, maple and bacon fat."
US,89.0,42.0,Wahluke Slope,Dusted Valley,"This wine's matchstick, dark fruit, vanilla, herb and spice aromas are brooding. It's full and rich on the palate, with dark fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
US,91.0,17.0,Napa Valley,Broman,"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling."
US,85.0,34.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pezzi King,"Densely layered in overwrought notions of brown sugar and vanilla, this wine has a flatness and a discernible sweetness to the overripe black-fruit core."
France,91.0,72.0,Champagne,Louis Roederer,"A finely structured, delicate, elegant wine, this has a pure white fruit and mineral character that lies easily on the palate. The aftertaste is soft but there is still a steely edge to the wine, which promises long aging. Give it at least 5 years."
US,92.0,44.0,Russian River Valley,Freeman,"A lovely Pinot Noir that shows fine Russian River character. Made from some good vineyards, including Keefer Ranch, it shows an elegant deliciousness of cherry and raspberry jam, cola and pomegranate flavors, touched with new oak. Silky and dry, this polished wine is good to drink now, and will hold for 6?? years."
France,89.0,45.0,Chablis,Domaine Ellevin,"Still young with attractive fresh fruits, this wine needs to age. With its bright acidity and white fruits, it's just beginning to hint at the mineral structure behind. Drink from 2018."
US,90.0,40.0,McMinnville,Panther Creek,"Dusty and toasty, with plenty of spice and just a hint of composty barnyard, this biodynamically farmed fruit brings in subtle notes of dried leaf and herb. Cranberry fruit flavors roll into fine-grained tannins and a medium-long finish."
US,90.0,32.0,Russian River Valley,Jigar,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, crisp and silky, for drinking now. It emphasizes ripe cherry, raspberry, cola and dusty exotic spice flavors that finish dry and fascinating."
US,86.0,32.0,Mendocino County,Artevino,"Rich in pineapple custard, pear and mineral flavors, this Chard offers lots of direct pleasure. Drink now with crab cakes, roast salmon, or squash risotto."
US,91.0,20.0,Ancient Lakes,Efeste,"This thoroughly delicious, acid-driven wine opens with aromas of passion fruit, oyster shell, herbs, wet stone and citrus. The flavors are sleek yet generous with electric, mouthwatering acidity. It demands oysters alongside it."
Australia,82.0,23.0,Barossa Valley,Yunbar,"How can a Barossa Shiraz be so green? Its flavors are herbal to the point of being close to cabbage or green bean, with just enough high-toned cherry fruit to be acceptable. ?J.C."
France,90.0,28.0,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,"Orange peel notes on the nose of this wine lead to a rounded, soft and fruity palate of juicy peaches and nectarines. A pleasant soft bitterness frames the fruit, giving texture and structure to the palate. The pithy finish is off dry, but beautifully balanced."
US,89.0,13.0,California,ChÃ¢teau Souverain,"It's a treat to find a well-priced Merlot that has some gutsy tannin and dark fruit to go along with its sweeter flavors and mild texture. This wine has concentrated black cherry, clove and oak spice flavors, with a firm structure and lingering finish."
US,82.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Dominican Oaks,"Soft and dull, with simple blackberry Lifesaver candy flavors that let the heat from alcohol show through."
US,88.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Basel Cellars,"Aromas of vanilla, spice box, toast and jammy red fruit are followed by quite elegant fruit flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up."
France,93.0,99.0,Meursault,Domaine Buisson Battault,"Very toasty aromas mark this wine. While the toast is present on the palate, it also offers plenty of fruit flavors, conveying apricot and white peach along with a citrus edge that brings out the freshness. Drink this wine from 2022."
US,84.0,19.0,Napa Valley,Napa Cellars,"A generic expression of the variety with some notions of ripe plum, dark cherry and black pepper, this straightforward wine is ready to drink now. It takes on full tannic strength on the finish."
US,84.0,65.0,Virginia,The Williamsburg Winery,"A beautiful dark plum color and elegant aromas of cherry, allspice and pepper lead this Virginia Merlot. Rich and savory notes and a bright fruit character are appealing but need time to age and integrate. Overall, a solid red for the cellar."
France,92.0,21.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,ChÃ¢teau Vignelaure,"This is a vibrantly rich wine that is brimming with delicious red fruit notes and bright acidity. Full and concentrated, it has weight without being heavy. It is a finely made wine, with a crisp finish."
US,90.0,14.0,El Dorado,Perry Creek,"It captures the Sierra Foothills balance of power and seems to have everything in the right proportions, including the price. Deep, nearly opaque garnet in color, it offers cedar and clove aromas that lead to rich fruit flavors like blackberry and boysenberry, firm tannins and full body."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Rosso del Veronese,Aldegheri,"Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent."
US,92.0,39.0,Calaveras County,Prospect 772,"Lavishly, densely ripe and fruity, this big, juicy wine has everything in spades, from the nearly black color to the jammy, dessert-like aromas to the saturated blackberry and black fig flavors to a full, opulent body and richly tannic texture. It sure packs a lot of power into each sip."
US,83.0,13.0,California,Chime,"The color is unusually light and brick-red, and this wine as a whole is rather light. Aromas are quite vivid and sharp, like smoke, herbs and rhubarb. The flavor is complex before it turns lean and sharp on the finish."
Italy,90.0,29.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Avignonesi,"Aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and a whiff of dark baking spice unfold in the glass while wild cherry, black raspberry, ground pepper and star anise drive the palate. Framed in firm, fine-grained tannins, this is a classic Tuscan red. Drink through 2020."
US,85.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Cardwell Hill,"The impression is that some of the fruit may have teetered on the edge of overripe, as the wine has a grainy, sugary mouthfeel. It's not overtly sweet, just granular, and the pear fruit flavors are lightly honeyed. It's best to drink this by late 2016."
France,90.0,27.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,ChÃ¢teau PÃ©gau,"Sourced from 50+ year-old vines in the commune of Sorgues, this aromatic blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% MourvÃ¨dre boasts hints of rosemary, bay leaf and clove. It's reasonably full bodied, with a long, drying finish that demands another year or two in the cellar or (preferably) some rare beef or lamb."
Spain,87.0,22.0,Rioja,Bodegas San Prudencio,"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things."
Italy,88.0,65.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Salcheto,"This has subdued toast, coconut, incense aromas, while the palate shows grilled herb, licorice and dried cherry flavors. Assertive, close-grained tannins leave an astringent finish."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze,Marsuret,"Delicate honeysuckle and white stone fruit aromas lead the way on this silky sparkler. The semisweet palate offers ripe white peach, green apple and candied citrus peel alongside a silky mousse."
US,93.0,48.0,Ribbon Ridge,Domaine Divio,"Smooth as silk and soft as butter, this glides across the palate in a smoky, sexy and seductive manner. Butter and berry, black cherry and a finishing flourish of chocolate nibs, capped with espresso, give this a complete start-to-finish set of flavors. Drink now and over the next decade."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Prosecco,La Marca,"Widely available, this easy Prosecco offers fresh aromas of citrus, stone fruit and honey. It's elegantly packaged with a light blue label that would look gorgeous at a lunchtime table set by the pool."
Argentina,91.0,70.0,Uco Valley,Monteviejo,"At first this seems over the top (it's 15.8%). But give the wine time and you'll find the ultimate presentation of ripeness, richness and depth. The flavors are thick and black, with chunky black plum, prune, syrup and more. But it's also healthy and not flabby, with balance and a sense of being. Excellent if you like monster reds."
US,85.0,32.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Basel Cellars,"This 100% varietal wine displays aromas of leather, barnyard, cherry cordial and raisinated fruit. Flavors are sweet and full, seeming a bit dried out and advanced beyond their years."
US,94.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"Merryvale's Profile remains a star year after year. The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power. With a smooth, complex tannin structure, it's rich in currants, blackberries and cedar, but is too young to open now. Should hit its stride around 2010 and continue to develop for some years after. Tasted twice, with consistent results."
US,90.0,100.0,Napa Valley,Ziata,"Blueberry, currant and smoky oak mark this wine, which provides additional highlights of black pepper and cedar. Generous in tannin and structure, this is the first vintage of this Karen Cakebread-made wine. It combines fruit from four vineyards across the valley, from Coombsville to Calistoga, including Shafer in Stags Leap. Drink now through 2022."
US,91.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,Failla,"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom."
Italy,94.0,28.0,Barbaresco,Adriano Marco & Vittorio,"This Barbaresco offers quintessential Nebbiolo aromas of red rose, leather and berry along with succulent cherry and raspberry flavors layered with spice, sage and Alpine herbs. It's wonderfully balanced, with bracing but fine tannins and fresh acidity, and will develop additional complexity with more bottle age."
US,86.0,24.0,Antelope Valley of the California High Desert,Coruce,"From 2,800 feet in one of the newer American appellations, this high-desert bottling offers plush and ripe lemon cream, pineapple and guava notes on the nose, with a slight chamomile complexity in the background. The flavors are intriguing, with Rainbow Stripe bubblegum, cotton candy and apple-strudel elements."
US,87.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Hendry,"This is huge, brawny Zin, given some parameters through its 15 months in oak, the vast majority of which was French and new. Behind the power lies a slight elegance, with a taste of tar and bittersweet chocolate that lingers on."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Collio,Livon,"Here's a standard, well-made Pinot Grigio that shows bright aromas of citrus, apple, pear and honey. It is defined by a sharp, crisp vein of acidity on the finish."
Spain,86.0,28.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Aljibes,"This smells gritty and herbal on first take, with roasted, leafy aromas. The herb and red fruit flavors are a bit spotty, remaining herbal and mildly green on the finish, with snappy acidity."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Somontano,Bodega Otto BestuÃ©,"This Tempranillo-Cabernet blend begins with scratchy, earthy aromas of moss, leather and herbal red fruits. It's alert and lively in the mouth, with strawberry, plum, raspberry and citrusy flavors. The finish hollows out and shows good length and a light structure."
Argentina,85.0,7.0,Mendoza,La Vuelta,"Dusty and subdued on the nose, but still friendly and varietally correct, with lychee and melon aromas. The palate is chunky, maybe a touch flatter than ideal, with citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes in regular fashion, with a pinch of bitterness and white pepper."
Italy,93.0,85.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Amantis,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of wild berry, blue flower, underbrush and a whiff of new leather emerge on this full-bodied red. The structured elegant palate delivers juicy morello cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled herb, licorice, pipe tobacco and baking spice framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018??028."
France,89.0,35.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Poupille,"This wine, from selected vineyards owned by the Carrille family, is rich and now mature. Its tannins are merging with the secondary flavors of the fruit as it softens and develops a spice and tobacco character. Drink this wine now."
US,88.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"This has been barrel-fermented and aged, yet it retains more than a hint of the grape's natural herbaceousness. Sharp-edged and assertive, it might pass for a Quincy from the Loire Valley."
US,87.0,15.0,Napa Valley,Villa Mt. Eden,"This bottling can be variable, but the '05 vintage helped craft a balanced, likeable Cab that shows true Napa quality at an everyday price. Dry and richly tannic, the wine shows herb-infused black currant, black tea and cedar flavors. Drink now through 2011."
France,91.0,75.0,Champagne,Dom Caudron,"Fermented in wood and with longer-than-usual aging on the lees, this wine shows ripe maturity. It is balanced, dry and crisp with apple and citrus flavors plus almonds and spice that show its satisfying age. Drink this fine bottling from this Pinot Meunier specialist now."
France,88.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Hecht & Bannier,"The Rolle grape (known as Vermentino in nearby Corsica) has the ability to produce rich wine, as it did here. The acidity is still there balanced with the ripe yellow fruits, generous texture and spicy southern warmth. This is a wine for food, ready to drink now."
Italy,90.0,55.0,Bramaterra,Le Pianelle,"A blend of Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina, this opens with aromas of aromatic herb, wild berry, menthol and a floral note. The firm, vibrant palate offers tar, sour cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside youthfully austere, fine-grained tannins. This needs time to soften up and fully develop. Drink 2019??027."
Argentina,89.0,20.0,Mendoza,Alta Vista,"Dark, minty and fiery on first take, this folds in aromas of licorice and oaky lemon peel along with spicy berry fruit. Firm and tightly built, this is spicy, peppery and chocolaty on a canvas of berry and cassis. Powerful, toasty and a touch hot on the finish."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Bolgheri,Viticcio,"Vermentino makes a great companion to sushi, Mediterranean fish dishes, light pasta salad or chicken salad. There's a zesty touch of fresh sage or rosemary on the nose followed by peach, citrus and melon aromas."
US,85.0,20.0,Lodi,Michael David,"A powerful Cabernet rich in black fruit, cinnamon and a backbone of mild tannin, Freakshow is robust and grippy, the finish showy in vanilla and smoky oak."
Italy,85.0,13.0,Friuli Grave,Plozner,"Smells lemony, making you brace for a lean mouthful of tart fruit. But the flavors are riper, offering pear as well as citrus, and the finish actually ends up slightly soft."
US,87.0,14.0,Central Coast,EOS,"This wine shows good Chardonnay character, from the creamy texture to the notes of buttered toast, vanilla, lemons and limes."
US,81.0,14.0,Russian River Valley,Michael Pozzan,"Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple."
Italy,90.0,37.0,Alto Adige,Abbazia di Novacella,"Made entirely with Moscato Rosa, this boasts heady scents of rose petal, wild strawberry and a hint of lavender. The silky palate delivers raspberry jam, candied orange zest and a hint of cake spice. Refreshing acidity nicely offsets the sweetness."
Spain,87.0,25.0,Cava,Segura Viudas,"Dusty aromas of apple and mild yeast form the bouquet on this traditional Cava. In the mouth, it's frothy and foamy on contact, while the flavors veer from peppery and dry to apple and citrus. This finishes nice and peppery, with proper dryness for a brut sparkler."
US,89.0,41.0,Chalone,Testarossa,"Acidity and mushroom and earth notes combine to mute the fresh fruits in this Chardonnay. It's rich in apricots, oranges and peaches, enhanced by oak, but has a dry, austere tug that suggests brief cellaring. Drink after 2016."
France,85.0,19.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau la Croix Margautot,"There seems to be too much wood here which is smothering the fruit. Given that, the wine does have weight and as the wood softens, the juicy fruit flavors should come through. Wait to drink until 2016. But it will always be austere."
US,86.0,19.0,Dry Creek Valley,Geyser Peak,"Even before you smell it, you can tell this is a sweetie from the old-gold color and thick texture. Aromas of vanilla custard and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, apricot preserves, orange-blossom honey and vanilla. Flavors are extravagantly fruity and sweet, with a honeyed aftertaste that lingers. It could use a bit more acidity to balance out all that sugar."
Spain,86.0,17.0,Rioja,RamÃ³n Bilbao,"Scratchy, herbal aromas settle on tar, asphalt, tart red fruits and leather. The palate on this cutting Rioja is pushy and full of bold acidity, while oak and herbal berry flavors finish minty and spicy, with a ringing, acid-driven feel."
Italy,91.0,18.0,Lugana,Tenuta Roveglia,"This savory white opens with refined fragrances of citrus blossom and orchard fruit. The juicy palate offers white peach, tart green apple, mouthwatering citrus and a note of Mediterranean herb. It's nicely balanced, with crisp acidity."
US,93.0,48.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"This is a dynamic wine, showing Key lime, yellow apples, oak smoke, butter, tangerine pith, macadamia nut and sea salt on the nose. The palate is streamlined with lime pith, lemon rind and seared pineapple flavors."
Spain,93.0,120.0,Priorat,Clos Berenguer del Molar,"Initial aromas of damp earth and coffee grounds are a bit misleading because this tastes almost entirely of ripe, slightly baked black fruits. This is a massive Cabernet-based wine with severely scratchy tannins. On the finish, rugged leftover tannins are like gravel, while this is saturated in a familiar Priorat way. Drink from 2019??027."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Castel del Monte,Santa Lucia,"There are raw, bright qualities of cherry liqueur and raspberry syrup that open the nose. It shows solid and polished tannins."
US,89.0,39.0,Los Carneros,V. Sattui,Reduced and extracted aromas burn off over time to unveil a full-bodied expression of juicy red fruit and cedar that opens in the glass. It finishes in tea and leather.
US,92.0,30.0,Red Mountain,Obelisco Estate,"Estate-grown, spicy and fresh, this exciting wine from a new Red Mountain producer shows outstanding potential. Carefully crafted by the winemaking team of Pete Hedges and Sarah Goedhart, it's stylish, European, sleek and polished. The fruit is spicy and bright, the barrel accents just right, the tannins smooth and supple, and the length surprising. A fine effort."
US,91.0,34.0,Paso Robles,Michael Rose Cellars,"Bright and vivacious black and red berries meet with dill, mint and white sage on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard, with a touch of sweet pine wood as well. Dried purple flowers are prominent on the sip, where touches of asphalt, charcoal and beef in a blackberry sauce are boosted by peppery spice."
France,88.0,33.0,Pernand-Vergelesses,Patriarche PÃ¨re et Fils,"The cool character of this under-rated appellation is apparent in this red-currant-dominated wine. With a fresh streak of acidity, the wood and spice flavors are contained and balanced. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
US,90.0,16.0,Carneros,RouteStock,"This is a dry, full-bodied deal of a wine, offering melon, papaya and zesty acidity around plenty of breadth and depth. Textured and luxurious, it finishes in ginger and Asian pear."
US,86.0,14.0,California,Three Pines,"This delicious, sweet and fruit-driven wine smells like pineapple and honey. It tastes full bodied, very ripe and unctuous, and has a long, lingering finish. It will be great with salty cheeses and toasted nuts."
US,88.0,100.0,McMinnville,Hyland,"This opens with pretty cherry fruit flavors, underscored with a touch of mineral and mocha. But there it ends, feeling one dimensional and fading fast in the finish. Three bottles tasted with similar results."
US,84.0,15.0,Russian River Valley,Healdsburg Ranches,"Oaky-sweet and simple, with jammy pineapple, tropical fruit and honey flavors. The best thing is brisk acidity and a clean finish."
US,86.0,19.0,Napa Valley,Black Stallion,"This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe."
US,93.0,28.0,Santa Maria Valley,Ojai,"A beautiful Chardonnay, dry, silky and modest in alcohol. It's rich in oak-inspired tropical fruit, peach and Meyer lemon fruit flavors, girded with a tangy minerality. Will be great with a mushroom risotto or something lobster based."
US,87.0,20.0,Monterey,Talbott,"Sweetly fruity and brisk in acidity, this Chardonnay shows savory pineapple, orange and mango flavors that taste like an upscale fruit-juice drink. Oak gives it a toasty, buttery note, while the alcohol brings warmth and full-bodiedness."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Puglia,Antica Enotria,"Organic farmer and winemaker Raffaele Di Tuccio delivers an easy 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano that bears simple aromas of cherry and wet earth. It shows a fresh, compact finish that would work nicely with tomato sauce and grated Parmigiano."
US,85.0,14.0,California,Pomelo,"A rounded mouthfeel and plenty of fruit flavors, like apple and honeydew, make this medium-bodied wine user-friendly. The acidity is soft, and the flavors drop off quickly on the finish."
US,89.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Maldonado,"This is a big, bold wine with a wild, slightly earthy and herbal character in the otherwise ripe blackberry and spicy pepper aromas and flavors. The texture is quite thick with tannins, and the body is full. It comes from the windy and cool Jameson Canyon corner of Napa Valley."
US,89.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"Hailing from 11 different vineyards located across the Columbia Valley, this appealing, 100% varietal wine provides aromas of toasty spices, dried herbs, cocoa and jammy dark fruit. The cranberry, coffee and blackberry flavors are sweet and focused, backed by chewy, lightly dry tannins that need time to soften."
US,89.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Cosentino,"This Cab-driven Meritage offers a heavy presence of tobacco leaf on the nose and palate, as well as cedar, both built around smooth, refined tannins. Then well-integrated blackberry, tar and black cherry take over, with the finish awash in dried herbs."
US,93.0,30.0,Dundee Hills,Aubichon Cellars,"Distinctive, artisanal and sourced from a spectacular site, this was fermented in oak and barrel aged. The hock bottle indicates the Alsatian style, and the wine inside is both powerful and  sturdy, with supple, generous flavors of stone fruits running into light tropicality."
France,85.0,12.0,Vin de Pays d'Oc,Douce Nature,This winery's investment in organic viticulture seems to have paid off. Fresh apple mixes with cotton candy on the nose while more serious notes of apricot and pear take over in the mouth. Vanilla and caramel linger on the zingy finish.
France,87.0,20.0,Fronsac,ChÃ¢teau Tessendey,"This blend of hand-picked 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc is still tough with dark tannins and a black plum-skin texture. It has a lean side, with a severe character that seems likely to remain part of the wine. Drink from 2016. The d'Arfeuille family is now in its fifth century on Bordeaux's Right Bank."
US,95.0,70.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"With fine acidity, grippy tannins and a tangy minerality, this Pinot offers complex flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, Dr. Pepper and spice that are laced with notes of dried herbs and white pepper. Turns dramatic on the midpalate, where the weight sinks in. Delicious now, this should develop over the next 6?? years."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Lost Angel,"Pizza, burgers, tacos and similar everyday fare will go well with this Merlot. It's smooth in cherries, currants and cola."
US,85.0,17.0,Virginia,Gray Ghost,"This Vidal Blanc has intriguing aromas of honeysuckle, peach and powdered ginger. On the palate it is reminiscent of a sugar cookie. This is an easy-drinking wine, light in body and complexity."
France,88.0,32.0,Mercurey,Domaines Devillard,"This blend from several vineyards is a soft, rounded wine. It has a good balance between acidity and ripe white and yellow fruits, shot through with acidity. A touch of toast adds spice to the mix. Drink from 2019."
France,90.0,20.0,FaugÃ¨res,Mas GabinÃ¨le,"A blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 20% Carignan and 10% MourvÃ¨dre aged in French oak for 12 months, this wine exhibits great depth of flavors against a tight structure. Notes of garrigue herbs and peppery spice infuse the blackberry and rich plum fruit core. Sweet oak flavors linger on the long finish along with firm but fine tannins. Drink now??016."
France,86.0,25.0,Chignin,Domaine les Cantates,"A hint of earthiness and tannins add complexity to this fruity, bright wine full of red berry flavors. It's fragrant, delicious and refreshingly juicy, but not for aging."
US,85.0,10.0,California,Gnarly Head,"This light-bodied wine has honeydew melon and cucumber aromas, subtle fruit flavors and a smooth soft texture. It's easy to sip and is low in acidity."
Italy,86.0,18.0,Prosecco,Ca' dei Zago,"This small winery and family-run bed-and-breakfast takes an artisanal approach to winemaking with this sparkler, which offers a yellow fruit flavor, with accents of spice and bitter almond."
US,88.0,28.0,Arroyo Seco,Ventana,"Violets, lilacs, black pepper, blackberry paste and hot asphalt show on the nose of this 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah blend from the appellation in the heart of Monterey County. The palate is ripe and juicy with boysenberry and blackberry fruits, wrapped up in a tannic asphalt structure."
US,84.0,23.0,Sonoma County,Paradise Ridge,"This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness."
Italy,85.0,22.0,Irpinia,Agricola Bellaria,"Aromas of pressed acacia flower, nut and smoke lead the nose. The lively, lean palate doles out unripe Bartlett pear, yellow apple skin and a flinty mineral note alongside zesty acidity."
US,93.0,60.0,Willamette Valley,Shea,"Block 23 is all Pommard clone. At first the drying, tea-flavored tannins push the fruit down, but over many hours the wine expands with generous flavors of cherry fruit leather, candied orange peel, and polished tannins."
US,91.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Pali,"Shows the clean, citrus acid juiciness and silky texture of the appellation and is totally dry. But you'll find ripe cherry, currant, pomegranate, peppermint tea, mineral and smoky oak flavors that finish complex and satisfying. Brilliant and versatile at the table."
Spain,89.0,20.0,Cigales,Museum,"Ripe berry aromas are a bit raisiny, with vanilla and balsam wood notes. This Tempranillo feels blocky, saturated and tannic. Flavors of raisin, prune, blackberry and wood spice are full and bullish, while a boundary-pushing finish maintains a palpable raisiny quality. Drink through 2020."
US,85.0,7.0,California,CK Mondavi,"Very focused and pure fruit aromas and flavors give this medium-bodied wine a tasty and straightforward personality. The texture is relaxed due to soft acidity and tannins, and everything tastes fresh and clean."
Argentina,86.0,12.0,Mendoza,Septima,"Spicy and dry on the nose, with subdued, earthy aromas that suggest some hotness. The palate is a bit fiery and aggressive, with red berry and cassis flavors. Warm and spicy on the finish; edgy but good overall."
France,90.0,65.0,Chablis,Domaine Charly Nicolle,"With its upfront, ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine is immediately attractive. Behind the fruitiness, there is a firm, structured character of minerality and a steely edge, which makes this a Chardonnay to age for 3?? years."
Argentina,87.0,20.0,San Juan,Graffigna,"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice."
US,86.0,40.0,Sonoma County,CaptÃ»re,"Tastes sweeter and fruitier than the 2009, which was dry, so if you like orange marmalade, pineapple tart and vanilla cookie sugariness in your Sauvignon Blancs, it's for you."
US,90.0,23.0,Sonoma County,Ferrari-Carano,"There are lots of buttered toast and popcorn flavors in this Chardonnay, but the underlying tropical fruits and pears are strong enough to stand up to them. It's a decadent wine to drink with richly sauced shellfish dishes."
US,83.0,10.0,Russian River Valley,Cameron Hughes,"Will satisfy Chardophiles with its oaky, creamy flavors and notes of pineapples, lemons and limes. Finishes dry and crisp in acidity."
US,92.0,55.0,Sonoma Coast,Davies,"Feral and wild, Spring Hill Vineyard lies in the Petaluma Gap where it is regularly enveloped in fog and cooling coastal winds. The result here is a soft, slightly stemmy, earthy wine with balanced layers of cherry, raspberry and vanilla."
Italy,86.0,12.0,Barbera d'Asti,Araldica,"Albera is a very well-valued Barbera d'Asti with chalky aromas of talc powder and schoolroom blackboard backed by cherries, blueberries and black fruit. Those polished mineral notes makes this is very interesting and unique expression of this native Italian grape."
Italy,88.0,24.0,Toscana,Olivi,"Predominantly Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of wet soil, black fruit, toast and baking spices. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry and prune accented with black pepper, tobacco and a hint of mocha alongside solid tannins. It's reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy now."
Italy,93.0,28.0,Barbera d'Asti,Braida di Giacomo Bologna,"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, forest berry and Alpine herb take center stage in this elegant and structured red. The vibrant palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and tobacco hints alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Impeccably balanced and delicious, it also offers incredible value. Drink through 2029."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Monastero,"Intense floral aromas that initially recall air freshener then burn off to reveal more subdued sensations of blue flower on this blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of cedar, white pepper and espresso alongside firm, drying tannins."
US,91.0,35.0,Humboldt County,Joseph Jewell,"Joseph Jewell's 2014s from remote Humboldt County are dazzling. The color off this wine is on the light side, and so are the raspberry, tea leaf and cinnamon flavors, but they make for a pleasant, harmonious combination. Medium body, vibrant acidity and firm but light tannins add to its appetizing character."
Italy,82.0,16.0,Colli Bolognesi,Gaggioli,"Thin and streamlined, this fresh sparkler offers mild aromas of peach and white flower. The wine is very simple and basic with a touch of sweetness on the close."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Nine Hats,"Nine Hats is a recently-introduced second wine from Long Shadows. Clearly this is great juice, though it is, inevitably, a bit of a mishmash blend. Tannins are a little rough, but as a $25 red this has plenty of high-priced flavor."
US,87.0,26.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Manzoni,"A big wine, ripe and explosive in fruit. Maybe too fruity, almost a bomb. Raspberries and cherries, sweetened with oak, dominate. Could use greater subtlety and restraint, not to mention grounding earthiness."
US,86.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Robert Hall,"Quite ripe in style, this wine packs a bevy of white flower aromas, from jasmine to tuberose, as well as fleshy yellow pears. There is solid sizzle in the glass once sipped, but the honeysuckle prominence, ripe peach and powerful orange-blossom flavors dominate."
US,84.0,45.0,Lake Michigan Shore,Mackinaw Trail,"Despite this being aged in new Russian oak, this Chardonnay is light bodied and oddly floral. Wild flower tones ride over underripe peach, with leesy undertones."
France,94.0,225.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau BÃ©lair-Monange,"This is a perfumed and generous wine with great tannins and a strong minerality. This is the first year that wines from the former ChÃ¢teau Magdelaine were also included in BÃ©lair as the two estates were amalgamated. It's dense, complex, balanced in character yet still with fruitiness of the vintage. Drink from 2024."
US,86.0,20.0,Paso Robles,EOS,"Fans of stickies may find pleasure in this bottling, but it is tremendously sweet and oily. Candied honeydew and kiwi scents meet with sweet juniper and pine on the nose. On the palate, it tastes squarely of golden honey. It's soft, unctuous and thick in consistency."
Italy,88.0,24.0,Toscana,Tenuta Sette Cieli,"Aromas of blueberry, baking spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot. The firm palate offers black plum, raspberry and black pepper alongside smooth tannins. It finishes on a note of mouth-puckering sour cherry."
France,89.0,54.0,Saint-Joseph,Delas FrÃ¨res,"A bit stern and tannic, but this tightly wound mix of black olives and espresso should come around by 2012 or shortly thereafter. It's chewy in texture, but finishes with decent fruit, so give it the benefit of the doubt."
Italy,91.0,33.0,Lugana,Selva Capuzza,"Fragrant and fresh, this vibrant wine offers alluring scents field flower and white stone fruit scents. The creamy palate delivers white peach, honeydew melon and citrus flavors, brightened with crisp acidity."
Argentina,89.0,34.0,Agrelo,Lamadrid,"Saturated on the nose, this has aromas of pencil lead, coconut, vanilla and black fruit. It feels tannic, with pulsing acidity pushing raisin, prune, black plum, licorice and graphite flavors. The finish is oaky, resiny and chocolaty tasting."
US,91.0,25.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Coyote Canyon,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache and MourvÃ¨dre, it's an immediately appealing wine with notes of coffee, black olive, blueberry and smoked meat. There's a pleasing texture and richness running from head to tail with coffee and chocolate flavors that linger on the finish."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Fiano di Avellino,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Aromas of hazelnut nut, smoke and dried chamomile flower slowly come together. On the racy palate, a mineral vein underscores yellow apple, lime and dried sage while a bitter almond note wraps up the finish."
Argentina,84.0,18.0,Mendoza,Lagarde,"Not very fragrant, in fact it's barely a step above water in its neutrality. The palate is clean and solid, with sweet flavors of candied mango and melon. Plump and on the mild and bland side overall."
US,84.0,13.0,Sonoma Coast,Cline,"Light in color, this affordable white is floral on the nose, with just a touch of reduction and heady smoky oak. Simply executed, it offers generous flavors of apple, pear and peach."
France,88.0,17.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau EugÃ©nie,"Here is a ripe wine from a fine vintage in Cahors. With touches of spice as well as rich black-currant fruits, the wine is all about its fruitiness and acidity?ably assisted by tannins. The aftertaste just keeps the fruit coming."
US,84.0,13.0,Napa Valley,Napa Creek,"So sweet in pineapples and oranges despite a crisp spine of acidity, it quickly palls, making it hard to take a second sip. But lots of Chardophiles will like it."
US,94.0,100.0,Sonoma Mountain,Paul Hobbs,"Made in the popular modern style, this is a particular success. It shows ultraconcentrated orange, apricot, green apple and peach flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture, and a strong coating of oak brings layers of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla. This richness would be excessive without the minerality and acidity that Sonoma Mountain brings. Don't drink this too cold."
US,89.0,36.0,Mendocino County,Artezin,"Zin specialist Artezin gets into the Petite Sirah game with this enormously ripe, fruity wine. Shows a modern, cult interpretation of the variety, with blackberry jam, licorice, candied violet, mocha and pepper spice flavors wrapped into huge, but very finely ground, tannins."
France,91.0,72.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Domaine Vincent Girardin,"This is a very mineral driven wine?the ripe fruit is cut with acidity, green fruits and herbs. Textured and ripe, its freshness is a counterpoint to the full fruit flavors."
France,91.0,75.0,Minervois La Liviniere,GÃ©rard Bertrand,"The heady and concentrated bouquet of this wine leads with forward scents of blackberry liquor, black plum, bramble, cocoa nib and crushed violet. Medium weight and creamy on the palate, the texture is like crushed velvet and the flavors recall black-fruit preserves, mulled blackberries, black tea and licorice root. Drink now??018."
US,98.0,140.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Charles Smith,"An Amaro-like mix of bitters and herbs; this is exceptionally dense and dark. The fruit is a grace note; the big flavors come from herb, earth, rock, barrel and more. Licorice, baking spices, smoke, black cherry, Bourbon barrel, and on it goes. Huge and dense and seemingly endless."
US,82.0,11.0,California,Spin the Bottle,"Good red wine in a light, herbaceous style. Tastes fresh and clean as if it was made with good quality standards. Lacks much Cabernet character, however, but adds sufficient cherry and berry flavors to make it complete."
US,89.0,36.0,Willamette Valley,Erath,"Very soft and smooth?like a Michel Rolland version of a Pinot Noir. The berry/cherry flavors are velvety and clean, the tannins supple, the palate seamless. The tang to the finish, showing some unintegrated acids, is the only jarring note."
US,92.0,49.0,Sonoma Coast,MacPhail,"Fans of ripe, sweet fruit will love this Pinot. It's huge in juicy raspberry and cherry, with spicy hints of Dr. Pepper and red licorice. It will be fun to see how the wine evolves over the next 6?? years."
Spain,92.0,50.0,Rioja,Casado Morales,"This is textbook Rioja gran reserva from a ripe, generous year. Aromas of cassis and prune blend with toasty, creamy oak. Fresh acidity is a lifesaver, because the tannins and oak level are up there. Flavors of tobacco, currant, vanilla and red plum end with a reprise of crisp acids and oak. This will last another 20 years before any fading comes into play."
US,94.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Sojourn,"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from a number of hillside and valley floor vineyards, including Beckstoffer Georges III, this still-developing wine is delicately layered in soft-grained tannins, a dusty, graphite spark around the mellow red fruit and anise. With a lingering finish, it ends with a touch of dust. Cellar through 2020."
US,89.0,14.0,Mendocino,Husch,"A tangy grapefruit flavor and refreshing acidity make this a good before-dinner quaff and an apt pairing with seafood. Herbaceous and citrus aromas carry through to the flavors, medium body and good balance."
US,92.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Ken Wright,"The 2008 Pinots from Ken Wright display their individual terroirs quite succinctly, with little evidence of the (roughly) 30% new oak they receive. The Abbott Claim has a bit more of a chocolaty flavor, with full, spicy cherry fruit at its core. In fact there is so much fruit, spicy and candied, that it is a bit like fruitcake, in a good way."
France,83.0,11.0,Bergerac,Yvon Mau,"Simple, clean, fresh, raspberry-flavored wine, with light acidity. There is an edge of apple and caramel, the aftertaste just off dry."
France,85.0,9.0,Vin de Pays d'Oc,Delas FrÃ¨res,"Ripe black plum and berry dominate the nose and mouth on this Merlot, with appropriate accents of coffee granules and black pepper to spice things up. Lightweight but round with a medium-length finish."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Bierzo,Cuatro Pasos,"Gritty leathery plum aromas are intense but also low on ripeness and charm. Par for 2013, which was quite cool and rainy, this wine feels racy, with abrasive tannins. Short standard black plum and berry flavors finish with controlled toasty oak notes."
France,86.0,40.0,Champagne,DumÃ©nil,"This soft wine shows a relatively high dosage, giving a ripe strawberry-fruit character. The acidity and fruit are gentle, hinting at a tannic edge from red wine in the blend."
US,89.0,42.0,Dundee Hills,Panther Creek,"Perhaps the most forward and appealing wine in the lineup, the Vista Hills Pinot Noir brings round flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, hints at pepper and herb, then finished up with lots more chocolate. Though not as detailed as some of the other Panther Creek single-vineyard offerings, it has pleasure written all over it."
France,89.0,18.0,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,"Lovely pure notes of red crunchy cherry dominate the nose. They are also present on the slender, almost slight, palate that is completely dry but full of the charm of the fruit. Ample freshness brightens the entire wine which is well-suited to being chilled. It's a friendly easy charming red."
US,84.0,15.0,Lodi,Shenanigans,"Starts off fine, with rich blackberry and black currant aromas and flavors. But once you take a sip, the wine turns sharp and unbalanced. Still, it's a perfectly decent sipper for everyday fare."
Argentina,87.0,19.0,Uco Valley,Salentein,"Honest Pinot Noir aromas of spicy, leafy cherry and plum are good but common. This feels just about right, albeit a touch full and creamy. Flavors of cola, cherry and chocolate are ripe, moderately oaked and finish creamy, with flavors of vanilla, savory spices and rooty sweetness."
US,85.0,22.0,Monticello,Jefferson Vineyards,"High-pitched, medium-intense notes of toasted wheat, black cherry, maduro and sweaty leather define the nose and palate. This is a medium-bodied wine, and it offers powdery tannins and juicy acids that support the flavors. Cherry and cocoa notes linger on the finish."
France,88.0,25.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"Rather closed on the nose, this shows plump, sweet pear fruit countered by sprightly, spiky, lemony acidity. This is lively and fruity and easy to drink; enjoy while flavors are at their peak."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de la Concordia,"Smoky aromas of tree bark and tobacco blend with dried, earthy cherry and plum scents. This feels a bit raw and pulling, while dried cherry, plum and baking-spice flavors finish good but a touch hot and scratchy. Drink now."
US,86.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Wild Horse,"This drinkable Pinot does have a tannic toughness. On the palate, there are good notes of cherry and cola, but hints of green unripeness compromise its future. Give it a good decant and drink now."
France,85.0,17.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Tanesse,"Crisply fruity, herbaceous and citric, with lemon zest and fine pineapple. The wine's acidity should soften in a year."
US,85.0,17.0,Sonoma Coast,Cline,"Excessive acidity gives this wine a sour bite, while the flavors, of cherries and cranberries, are tart. Significant new oak helps to provide spicy richness. Drink now."
US,88.0,22.0,Applegate Valley,Cowhorn,"At just 12.6% alcohol, this might seem underripe for warm climate varieties, but it tastes perfectly full and nicely balanced. It's tart and lemony, to be sure, and in fact makes a fine accompaniment to fresh-shucked oysters."
Italy,93.0,20.0,Montefalco Rosso,Milziade Antano,"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this bold wine conveys earthy aromas of blackberry, leather, tilled soil and a balsamic note. The ripe, creamy palate delivers juicy black plum, cassis, savory herb and baking spice balanced by smooth, velvety tannins. The lingering finish closes on a note of ground black pepper."
US,90.0,34.0,Yakima Valley,Full Pull & Friends,"Raspberry, licorice and dark-fruit aromas lead to plump, fleshy fruit flavors. It's an unabashedly warm-vintage wine that brings a lot of drinking pleasure."
Italy,92.0,42.0,Alto Adige Terlano,Cantina Terlano,"Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, this wine opens with multifaceted aromas of ripe orchard fruit, candied citrus zest, pressed flower and mineral tones. The focused, elegant palate offers ripe apple, pear, tangy nectarine, lemon drop and flint. While enjoyable now, this will drink well through 2023."
Argentina,86.0,12.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Earthy and a bit foresty on the nose, with a leather accent to the berry aromas. Full and reasonably sound across the palate, which offers baked berry and coffee flavors in front of a modest, leathery finish."
France,85.0,13.0,Bordeaux,Exem,"The wine is soft with a toasty spicy character. That balances with the ripe berry fruits that are just on the stalky side of smooth. Drink this wine, with its fruity 70% Merlot, now."
US,91.0,35.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Eternal,"Vibrant aromas of white flowers, ripe peach, fresh herb, cocoa butter and hard candy lead to nuanced, well-balanced fruit flavors that show just a touch of lees influence. It offers an exquisite sense of balance and depth along with an extended finish."
US,84.0,24.0,Monterey County,Cru,"Not much going on beyond lots of oak and crisp, Central Coast acidity. You'll find watered down orange and tropical fruits."
Spain,85.0,30.0,Priorat,Marco Abella,"From the starting gun, this is a raisiny, candied wine with complexity issues. The palate is tannic and not the least bit varied; basically it just sits there. Flavors of raisin and red licorice finish sweet, medicinal and with a note of green peppercorn. This is flavorful but blocky and strange."
US,94.0,125.0,Stags Leap District,Pine Ridge,"From a steep, densely planted estate vineyard, this is a lilting regional example of well-integrated oak in support of black raspberry, licorice and chalky clove. Silky tannins mark it most, providing a balance to the fruit and a pronounced, entirely delectable bite of black pepper on the finish."
France,88.0,30.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Dopff & Irion,"A mature, serious wine, showing toasty flavors that are rounding out the fruit. A definite food wine, its richness tempered with a bite of acidity and delicious final crispness."
France,89.0,22.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Greysac,"On the austere side, with a firm and dry tannic structure, this represents the classic style of Bordeaux. It has black currant fruit and a mineral edge, with a severe structure that demands to be aged."
Italy,94.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Castello di Neive,"Structured and loaded with finesse, this stunning red opens with scents of perfumed berry, rose petal, baking spice and a balsamic note. The focused palate delivers juicy black cherry, ground pepper, anise and tobacco alongside firm but refined tannins. It has great length, closing on a mineral note. Drink 2018??028."
Italy,83.0,19.0,Puglia,Cefalicchio,"A garnet color and amber highlights mark the appearance of this biodynamic wine. It presents slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch and apple, backed by raspberry and strawberry tones."
US,89.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Standing Stone,"Bristles of lemon-lime acidity lend energy and vibe to this unusually refreshing GewÃ¼rztraminer. Perfumed with ripe tropical fruit and voluptuous on the palate, it maintains varietal typicity, but has an irresistible zest that's worth seeking out."
US,87.0,22.0,Chehalem Mountains,Anam Cara,"At 12g/L residual sugar, this just barely qualifies as dry. Fruit flavors suggest lemon curd and green pineapple, and there's an interesting savory note. But flatness across the palate keeps the score from going higher."
US,93.0,49.0,Eola-Amity Hills,MacPhail,"A highly-regarded California producer of Pinot Noir dips its toe into the Oregon waters with this inaugural vintage from the Roserock Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA. It's impressive, elegant and sensual, with the subtle complexity for which the grape is famous. Rose petals, red fruits, light spices, a compelling texture and mouthfeel, and overall elegance all point to a wine with a decade or more of life ahead."
US,90.0,40.0,Atlas Peak,Hawkstone,"Merits its high score by virtue of the concentrated black currant flavors that are so intense and pure, they're the essence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Yet the wine is also very tannic, with a lockdown astringency that leaves the mouth all puckery after you swallow. Give it 5?? years in a good cellar."
Australia,91.0,17.0,South Australia,Yalumba,"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017."
France,88.0,45.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Clos de L'Oratoire des Papes,"Modest pear, pineapple and lemon oil scents mark the nose, while the palate suggests marshmallow, pear and melon. This is full bodied and slightly honeyed in style, with a long, plush finish redolent of ripe citrus. Drink now."
US,86.0,15.0,Seneca Lake,Four Degrees of Riesling,"Smoke and mineral notes lend a prominent savory tone to this wine, contrasting a palate that's sunny and sweet with pressed apple and pear flavors. It's straightforward in style, but refreshing with bright lemon acidity and a lasting iced-tea sweetness."
US,87.0,54.0,Napa Valley,Snowden,"Super-dark in color, this extracted wine offers a reductive note on the nose, followed by a rustic tinge of hay and brick. Intensely flavored and oaked, it finishes unexpectedly herbal and dry."
Italy,85.0,18.0,San Marino,Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino,"Here is a fresh and vibrant Biancale-based wine (with a small percentage of Chardonnay for structure and smoothness) that offers aromas of citrus, peach and green fruit. Try it with appetizers or finger foods."
US,88.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"Full-bodied ripeness and creamy oak combine for a forceful white wine, rich and textured, made from a selection of two vineyard sites, including Bow Tie, a vineyard-designate. Toasty spice adds complexity before the wine finishes in caramel."
US,87.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Basalt,Forward fruit flavors of blackberry and plum slide quickly through the mid-palate and on into a soft finish. A faint wash of leather and earth wraps it up.
France,86.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau de Cranne,"Bright and fruity, this wine has all the richness of whites in this vintage. It has yellow fruits, citrus and a warm, rounded texture. There is just a touch of herbal acidity at the end to keep it fresh."
France,85.0,23.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Charles Sparr,"Pure Pinot Noir has produced a full, fruity sparkling wine. It is lightly crisp, fresh with wild strawberries and acidity. The aftertaste, soft and rounded, has a satisfying creamy character."
Spain,88.0,37.0,Terra Alta,EdetÃ ria,"Waxy, minerally aromas include whiffs of butterscotch, peach pit and dusty apple. This is big and heavy on the palate, with just enough malic acid to keep it upright. Briny flavors of mustard and pickle finish with weight and the variety's patented lanolin character."
Spain,87.0,17.0,Cava,Vallformosa,"Apple and orange aromas are light and slightly toasted. The palate is easygoing. Flavors of orange and nectarine are fresh and appropriate for Cava. The finish is solid, fresh and alert."
Italy,84.0,32.0,Beneventano,De Lucia,"Thin and low in aromatic impact, this luminous white blend of Falanghina, Greco and Fiano delivers measured tones of exotic fruit, pear and honeysuckle. The wine has a broad, fat feel in the mouth and ends with flavors that recall mature nectarine and apricot."
Italy,88.0,43.0,Barolo,Giribaldi,"Toast, espresso and mocha aromas lead the nose while the bracing palate offers raw red berry, anise, coffee and a hint of chocolate. Grainy tannins provide firm support but leave an astringent finish. Wait another few years for the tannins to soften a bit then drink up."
US,86.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Kana,"Kana's Workingman's Red has turned into a southern RhÃ´ne style blend of six grapes, the only outlier being a splash of Tempranillo. Toasty, round and easy-drinking, it's a good, all-purpose barbecue red, with a smoky, espresso-scented finish."
France,88.0,18.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Joseph Drouhin,"Warm and ripe, this has fine honey and yellow fruit flavors. It has well-integrated acidity, with a touch of apple that lends a crisp finish."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Campania,Di Meo,"Enticing aromas of pear, white flower, exotic fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean herb lift out of the glass. On the bright palate, a light mineral vein underscores green apple, pineapple and banana while fresh acidity adds zest."
France,83.0,12.0,Bordeaux,Les Vignerons RÃ©unis de MonsÃ©gur,"This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity."
US,90.0,27.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"Tangy black cherry and cassis flavors are punchy and penetrating in this Bordeaux-style blend (with an emphasis on Cabernet Sauvignon). It's richly, densely textured, but uplifted by a strike of cranberry acidity and granite. It's a polished wine with a long, meandering finish."
France,91.0,24.0,Alsace,Domaine Seilly,"This full-bodied wine with its spice and creamed pear fruit flavors, feels rich and smooth. Structured and textured, the balanced acidity shows through well, giving a warm, off-dry aftertaste."
France,88.0,25.0,Saumur-Champigny,Domaine de la Perruche,"A smooth and ripe wine that is rich in fruit as well as tannins. It has red berry flavors, a direct line in acidity and a texture that brings out both minerality from the limestone soil and dark fruit tannins. Drink from 2014."
US,90.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),GÃ¥rd,"Aromas of beeswax and lemon oil, the flavors following along with tangerine, orange and peach. Very dry, with exceptional concentration of fruit, and well-integrated flavors of cracker and grain. This was barrel fermented, and delivers a long, concentrated finish."
US,91.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"Wallywood is a RhÃ´ne-style red, with two thirds Syrah, while Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Petite Sirah fill in the rest. It surprises with its elegance, despite hefty alcohol and tannic components. It's a very well-done blend, melding together flavors of plum, berry, herb, stem, earth and iron."
France,89.0,16.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Cadillac,"This top cuvÃ©e from ChÃ¢teau Cadillac has great fresh black currant fruits, dark plum skins and sweet tannins. It is also very obviously aged in wood, and this element needs to calm down. Wait another year, or decant now."
France,89.0,28.0,Ile de BeautÃ©,Yves Leccia,"This blend of Grenache and Niellucciu comes from vines that are up to 40 years old. It is a big, bold ripe and juicy wine, bursting with black plum and berry flavors. The wine is fruity enough to drink now, although it should age for at least 10 years."
France,86.0,21.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Klipfel,"This is a ripe wine with sugared strawberry flavor. There is ample acidity to balance this fresh wine, and a soft mousse on the finish."
US,87.0,32.0,Applegate Valley,SolÃ©na,"Chewy and tannic, this has plenty of barrel flavors, but is light on the fruit. Coffee, caramel and toasty components are all here, seeming to smother any ripe fruit that might fill out the middle."
US,84.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Cass,"Dark for a rosÃ© and rather full-bodied, this blush has pie-filling flavors of black cherries and red currants. It's simple and direct but tasty. Nice with ham, fresh fruit, or a shrimp salad with bitter greens and grapefruit."
Italy,93.0,58.0,Barbaresco,Produttori del Barbaresco,"Bold and full bodied, this opens with rather subtle aromas of chopped herb, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of star anise. The ripe palate is more expressive, doling out black raspberry, juicy morello cherry and baking spice set against a backbone of noble tannins."
US,87.0,38.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Liquid Farm,"Marked by brisk, cutting acidity, this Chardonnay is bone dry, with a steely, stony cut of mineral that's relieved by lemon and lime flavors. It's a severe wine by itself, but it should be food friendly."
US,90.0,45.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Bonaccorsi,"Shows exuberant fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries, with plenty of sweet, toasty oak. It's a fine wine, brisk in acidity and softly tannic, and lovely as it tastes now, it should gradually evolve in the bottle for several years."
US,85.0,10.0,Alexander Valley,Kirkland Signature,Smoke and baked plum notes provide flavor within this wine's easygoing structure and approachability.
Spain,88.0,19.0,Bierzo,Vinos de Arganza,"Baking-spice aromas are out front, followed by notes of chocolate, berry fruits and smoke. This feels ripe, tannic and chewy, while flavors of toast and spice accent blackberry fruit. Flavors of oak, mint, coffee and hard spices control a slightly hot finish."
US,86.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Atwater,"Notes of violet petal and graham cracker crumb accent juicy red plum and cherry flavors on this full-bodied blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The tannins are coarse and a tad grippy, but they taper out nicely toward the finish."
Spain,87.0,19.0,PenedÃ¨s,Castellroig,"Briny citrus-peel aromas show a pyrazinic green side and a touch of corn tortilla. A somewhat dilute palate is bolstered by a shock of citric acidity, tasting of stone fruits and citrus. On the finish, early nectarine notes are replaced by briny flavors."
US,88.0,14.0,Clarksburg,The White Knight,"I like this wine a lot, even though it doesn't have Viognier's typical exotic richness. Bone dry, with mouth-tingling acidity and low alcohol, it shows citrus, coconut macaroon, apricot and spice flavors that finish with real complexity. The cool vintage definitely was kind to this inland, Delta appellation."
Australia,99.0,300.0,Rutherglen,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,"This wine is dark brown in hue with a greenish-gold tint to its rim, providing clues to its advanced age. The aromas are nutty, with mossy notes of rancio filled out by sweet flavors of dried dates and figs. It's full bodied and unctuous in texture, without being overblown or heavy on the palate. The intense finish lingers forever?or at least until you give in and take another sip."
Italy,95.0,55.0,Chianti Classico,Monteraponi,"This stunning wine opens with a multifaceted fragrance of underbrush, leather, spice, woodland berries and violets, with a whiff of mint. The layered palate delivers a vibrant core of succulent black cherry accented with white pepper and balsamic herbs. It's still young and structured with forceful yet fine tannins so give it time to develop fully. Drink 2015??025."
France,94.0,90.0,Madiran,Vignobles Brumont,"There is great balance in this wine. It is poised between fresh black fruits and mature tannins, allying black-plum and damson fruitiness to the rich structure and dark texture. Still developing, as befits a 100% Tannat wine, it will really be ready to drink from 2018."
US,92.0,70.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Serene,"Quite toasty, with deep scents of buttered nuts, this luscious wine delivers generous flavors of new barrels, ripe apples, pears and buttered popcorn, set against defining acids."
US,92.0,38.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Testarossa,"A stellar wine, this appellation blend rivals some of the Los Gatos-based winery's single vineyard expressions. Exotic dried apples, vanilla cream and popcorn pop on the nose, while there palate's extreme acidity and explosiveness freshness demands immediate enjoyment. Butter-seared apples, grapefruit pith and a touch of flint round out the flavors."
Italy,87.0,36.0,Taurasi,I Capitani,"This jammy wine doles out overripe plum and mature dark-berry fruit, layered with a melted chocolate sensation. Warm and evolved, it has an almost sugary-sweet palate that's shy on freshness."
France,89.0,45.0,Champagne,Legras & Haas,This is a fruity crisp wine that is finely balanced. It has a dry edge to it of bright white and citrus fruits along with a floral character that is enticing and open. The wine is lively and ready to drink.
US,87.0,30.0,Naches Heights,Wilridge,"Aromatically intriguing, this carries suggestions of sour cherry, umami and fresh tobacco. The palate brings medium-bodied cranberry and cherry flavors. It doesn't have the tannic structure that this variety is known for but there is still plenty to enjoy."
Italy,94.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,San Polino,"Soft, plush and modern, this is a superstar Brunello with all the qualities we love in this gorgeous category of wine. Made from organically farmed fruit, it offers amazing intensity and determination with aromas of spice, blackberry and currants. The texture is smooth and silky and the tannins offer a solid backbone."
US,89.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Basel Cellars,"100% varietal, this wine exhibits aromas of dried herb, cigar box, and cherry. The flavors are tart, light and elegant, harmonizing on the finish."
France,90.0,15.0,CrÃ©mant de Loire,Domaine du Petit Clocher,"Aged, like so many Loire sparkling wines, in the caves of Saumur, this is a rich wine. It has a nutty charm as well as ripe apple and white stone-fruit flavors. Its acidity is finely integrated giving a smooth wine. It is ready to drink."
US,91.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Jones of Washington,"Honeysuckle scents and ripe, fresh fruit flavors run from grapefruit on into tropical. This was fermented in Hungarian puncheons, picking up just a hint of toast along the way. Clean and quite delicious."
France,93.0,124.0,Champagne,Jean Milan,"To celebrate the family's 150th anniversary (founded in 1864), the Milans have released two Champagnes, half fermented in wood the other half in tank. The result for this Blanc de Blancs is a full wine, with a future that will bring out richness as well as a tight, mineral structure with just a hint of toast."
US,83.0,18.0,Central Coast,Clos La Chance,"An average, slightly raw Syrah, with edgy tannins that finish with a bit of a scowl. Packed inside are blackberry, currant, cocoa, pepper and herb flavors."
US,88.0,35.0,Wahluke Slope,Lobo Hills,"This blend of 67% Stonetree Vineyard Syrah and 33% Arianses Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. delivers vanilla, baking spice and dried cherry notes. Its fruit flavors are sweet but seem dried out. Drink now."
US,89.0,24.0,California,Naggiar,"Citrus and light herb aromas turn to slightly more buttery, spicy flavors in this medium-bodied well-balanced wine. It has a good sense of richness in the mouthfeel along with hints of vanilla, cream and almond flavors to complement the fruit notes."
Italy,86.0,43.0,Barolo,Raineri Gianmatteo,"This opens with aromas of French oak, toast, menthol and coconut while the lean palate offers mint and a hint of dark spice. It lacks fruit richness while bracing tannins grip the finish."
US,89.0,23.0,Finger Lakes,Red Tail Ridge,"BlaufrÃ¤nkisch, also known as Lemberger, has found a happy home in the Finger Lakes, and this example from winemaker Nancy Irelan is striking. Tart Morello cherry is accented by cool swathes of fresh herbs and a touch of smoked nuts. It's concentrated and robust, yet elegantly composed. Soft tannins trace a moderately long finish."
US,90.0,25.0,Wahluke Slope,Locus,"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas lead off this wine, along with plum. On the palate rich, textured dark fruit flavors intermingle with barrel spices. The fruit and oak have equal footing."
Spain,87.0,18.0,MÃ¡laga,Jorge OrdÃ³Ã±ez & Co.,"Floral white-fruit aromas come with a pyrazinic scent of sweat. This feels solid, with modest acidity. Candied flavors of mango, lychee and melon blend with pyrazine-driven notes of grape skins and bitterness."
US,88.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Moshin,"High in perceptible acidity, this wine leans savory in rhubarb, cranberry and a twist of sour cherry, adding in clove and black pepper behind the scenes. Light-bodied, it's soft and table-ready."
US,91.0,65.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Double Canyon,"High-toned aromas of cocoa, toast, mixed green herb and dark fruit lead to tart cherry and cranberry flavors that bring a pucker factor. It shows a very lovely sense of balance that keeps the interest high. Give it some additional time in bottle or a short decant."
US,91.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chester Kidder,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (66%), Syrah (23%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of violets, black licorice, dried blackberries and dark fruit are followed by ripe, full-bodied dark fruit and baking-spice flavors. The tannins pack a hefty but still well-balanced punch."
Spain,87.0,6.0,Campo de Borja,Borsao,"A steal for six bucks; the nose is floral and black, but under control. Meanwhile, the palate is bouncy, round and balanced, with juicy black plum and wild berry flavors. Clean and solid."
France,86.0,12.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,FranÃ§ois Lurton,"Floral, fruity wine, very herbaceous in a New Zealand intense style. Grapefruit and melon give the wine great freshness. It's ready to drink."
US,86.0,35.0,Sonoma Coast,Prosper,"This brushy, foresty wine offers big, ripe blackberry and cherry flavor around a smoky core of oak."
France,91.0,25.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau la Gordonne,"Complex and rich, it has ripe red fruits that are full of sweetness as well as some fresher acidity. With red plum, minerality and vanilla, it can age for a few months. Wait until 2015."
US,85.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Byington,"This wine is both intensely ripe and veering on sugary, while not offering much in terms of body. It becomes somewhat flat on the finish."
US,86.0,49.0,Diamond Mountain District,A.S. Kiken,"A good but average red wine for drinking now. Shows ripe berry, cherry, currant, licorice and spice flavors, with edgy tannins that are a little scoury. Drink up."
Italy,89.0,12.0,Nebbiolo d'Alba,Veglio,"A potpourri of violets, sweet baking spices and woodland berries take center stage. The savory palate offers up wild cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Drink soon."
France,85.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Famille Perrin,"This is a straightfoward, plummy, grapy red wine. It's medium in body but rather simple, ending on a slightly astringent, chalky note. Ecocert."
US,93.0,100.0,Alexander Valley,The Bridge,"A partnership between Ken Forrester and Sonoma County--based winemaker Jesse Katz, this 100% varietal wine comes from a single block of a rocky, hillside site that Katz also sources for his delicious Devil Proof Malbec. Creamy, concentrated waves of vanilla and cherry, with just a hint of almond, open the way to high-toned structure and integrated tannin and oak, finishing balanced and bright."
Spain,89.0,19.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Finca de Arantei,"Floral and lightly tropical on the nose, and totally pleasant. The palate is pure and lively, with elegance and some spritz. Flavors of nectarine, peach and melon are fresh, and the wine finishes easy and smooth. Very nice; just short of excellent but still it's 100% quaffable."
US,92.0,150.0,Howell Mountain,Notre Vin,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager. Cellar until 2017."
US,86.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ott & Murphy,An uneasy mix of grapes and flavors. Peaches and apricots?more skin than flesh?seem to hit a hard wall and just stop. Can a Viognier have a ?dumb??phase? That is what seems to be going on here.
Spain,83.0,8.0,Campo de Borja,Borsao,"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music."
US,94.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Barden,"Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink now??030."
US,87.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,Kiona,"This is 100% Cabernet from a 25-year-old estate vineyard. There?s plenty of vanilla and cassis in the nose, with some pickled volatile acidity lurking about. Firm and earthy, with a hint of mint and some dark, toasty streaks running through the red fruit. High-toned and slightly hot in the finish."
US,88.0,21.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"This wine leans into the green side of the variety, with aromas of garden herbs, green pepper, dark chocolate and cherry. The palate brings abundant savory flavors along with chewy tannins."
US,86.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Dry Creek Vineyard,"A bit rustic and heavy, with extracted jammy fruit but lacking a certain vivacity and sharpness in the mouth. Good enough for the price. Production was 12,500 cases."
US,91.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Nuggucciet,"Pomegranate aromas on the fairly tight nose of this wine combine with sandalwood, hibiscus tang and minerality. It's tight, bright and rocky on the palate, with chipped slate flavors providing an earthy backbone to the cranberry fruit."
US,88.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,August Truth,"Light and clear in color, this wine veers into cool-climate, restrained territory in its well-defined lines of sage, dried herb and stemmy earth. Dry tannins give an oomph of power beneath traces of dried rose."
US,92.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Cade,"A new brand from the PlumpJack folks, and a very promising start. It brings Sancerre-like sophistication and polish to a variety that's usually not very elegant. With crisp acidity and a mineral backbone, the wine's flavors are of citrus fruits, figs and vanilla, with a hint of tart gooseberry. The winery is set to release a pair of Cabs in the next few years."
France,89.0,50.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Haut Gravet,"Rich, maturing fruit flavors bring blackberries and sweet plums to the fore. They are firmly sustained by dense tannins, themselves rich. This is a solid, wood aged wine that has weight and some good concentration."
US,85.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Hunt Cellars,"The brawniest of Hunt's releases, it borders on Port-like, with 14.7% alcohol and a burst of plummy, raisiny fruit. Other notes include char, smoke and a caramelized, pie-crust scent. Drinks big, slightly sweet, hot and peppery.  ?S.H."
US,84.0,10.0,Washington,Radius,"The aromas are quite faint here but the apricot flavors are in abundance on this off-dry, medium-bodied easy drinker."
US,88.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Valley Legend,"Scads of ripe blackberry, blueberry, cherry and Cocoa Puff fruit flavors on this Cabernet, which is also rich in sweet, buttery oak. It's delicious by definition, yet the modern style could use some restraint."
US,94.0,46.0,Santa Maria Valley,Flying Goat Cellars,"Winemaker Norm Yost's decision to release later than most of his neighbors pays off tremendously every vintage. The nose on this bottling is delicate but with tons of sexy, supple depth, mixing red cherry, hibiscus and pomegranate with iron and sweet bay leaf. Perfect red fruits decorate the lavish palate: the tartness of cranberry, the lushness of red cherry, the brightness of pomegranate, all cut by eucalyptus and expert acidity."
France,92.0,65.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Chartron et TrÃ©buchet,"This wine is closed and firm in character, but has considerable potential. It has the makings of a mineral and spice-flavored wine that is textured while showing ripe yellow fruits and a citrus backdrop. It needs to wait; drink from 2017."
France,90.0,29.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Sylvaine et Alain Normand,"This wine is well balanced, ripe with apricot and white-peach flavors that contrast with the kiwi and grapefruit freshness. A more mineral edge gives texture. This delicious wine will be even better to drink from 2017."
US,88.0,44.0,Sonoma Coast,Kokomo,"Earthy, funky black tea and forest floor invite one in for further exploration of this block-specific offering that becomes lean and bright on the palate. Pomegranate dominates in terms of fruit, as spicy acidity elevates the experience."
Italy,85.0,20.0,Delle Venezie,Piera Martellozzo,"bright sparkling wine made from Ribolla Gialla grapes, this has thick aromas of stone fruit, butterscotch and caramel. The finish is fresh, with creamy effervescence."
US,90.0,30.0,Anderson Valley,Donkey & Goat,"A whisper of a wine made from Chardonnay grapes as a pÃ©tillant naturel, or pet-nat, this third vintage of Lily's CuvÃ©e should prove as enormously popular as the prior two, dry, delicious and unbearably light. No sugar or yeast are added and the grapes are whole-cluster pressed. There's no better wine for midday picnics or hikes in the woods."
US,89.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Phantom Rivers,"Prune, stewed plum and warm cranberry sauce blend with anise and brown spice on the nose of this wine from Paso Robles' Eastside. The flavors, framed by good acid and tannins, are evenly presented red fruits, with a distinct strawberry finish."
Italy,85.0,23.0,Rosso di Montalcino,San Polo,This simple light-bodied red offers delicate whiffs of tart sour cherry and a whisper of clove. The delicate aromas are also found on the diluted palate alongside firm acidity and fleeting tannins.
Italy,86.0,18.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Mionetto,"Mionetto is a steady producer of clean, easy-drinking sparkling wine that is consistent and fun to drink year in and year out. This expression is ripe with sweet peach and lime."
US,89.0,35.0,Yakima Valley,Manu Propria,"The winery's second release coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this wine is still in its shell, with brooding aromas of raspberries and blackberries, fresh thyme, savory herbs and tobacco. Blackberry and cherry flavors are lighter in style, backed by a wall of tannins that at present permits no entry. The wine needs significant time in the cellar to reveal it possibilities. Best after 2020."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Trentino,Castel Firmian,"Lightly scented, this straightforward, easygoing wine offers delicate apple and citrus sensations. It's lean but refreshing, with a racy acidity that gives it a crisp, clean finish."
US,87.0,27.0,New York,Belhurst,"A winning combination of sweet and savory, Belhurst's Traditions smells deliciously of syrupy boysenberry jam amidst the backdrop of a rustic barnyard. On the palate, juicy, ripe black fruit flavors gain complexity from a rich, earthy mushroom notes in the midpalate. Luscious and smooth with medium body and soft acidity."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Ghemme,Tiziano Mazzoni,"Leather, ripe dark-skinned berry, chopped herb, rose and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The austere palate offers tart red cherry, sour cranberry, sage and a hint of anise alongside firm tannins. Give it time to fully develop. Drink after 2022."
Italy,87.0,65.0,Barbaresco,Ca' del Baio,"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, crushed herb and blue flower. The palate is tightly wound and rather closed, showing hints of orange zest and raw cranberry. Racy acidity and austere tannins clench the finish."
US,89.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Concannon,"A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay aromatically suggestive of candied fruit and dried apricot, it offers a healthy dose of minerality amidst a well-composed structure. Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything."
France,87.0,15.0,Lot,ChÃ¢teau de CÃ©nac,"Using fruit sourced from vineyards close to Cahors, this is a rich, soft, tropical-fruit-flavored wine that shows how the Mediterranean influence reaches this inland area. It is rich, with notes of apricot, green plum and mango. Ready to drink."
US,91.0,35.0,Stags Leap District,Baldacci,"This is the least costly of Baldacci's '06 Cabs, and is quite close in quality to the more expensive bottlings. It's classic Napa, showing beautiful tannins framing ripe, juicy flavors of blackberries, black currants, plums and smoky cedar. Combines power with elegance, and should develop over the next six years."
Italy,94.0,45.0,Barbaresco,Nada Giuseppe,"Iris, violet, steeped cherry, camphor and underbrush aromas come together in the glass. The chewy, succulent palate offers red cherry, raspberry, aromatic herb and star anise while firm but refined tannins provide backbone and a velvety mouthfeel. It boasts balance, freshness and body. Drink 2018 through 2025."
US,91.0,45.0,Paso Robles,Nova Vita,"A very nice Syrah, with lots of ripe fruit but also a good structure. It's rich in blackberry, cherry and cola flavors, with an earthiness suggesting mushrooms sautÃ©ed in brown butter and sprinkled with black pepper and Chinese 5 spice. Firm tannins ground it."
US,87.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Sheldrake Point,Dusty mineral and candied orange rind lend a savory tone to pressed apple and pear in this surprisingly big-bodied off-dry Riesling. Soft tangerine acidity and a yielding red-apple fruit profile lends a broad warmth to the finish.
US,84.0,24.0,Alexander Valley,J. Rickards,"Shows the thick, furry tannins Petite Sirah is known for, with some good black currant, anise and cedar flavors. Feels a bit sharp, with a cut of mint. Drink now."
US,86.0,18.0,California,The Naked Grape,"This is an easygoing wine that's neither too oaky nor too crisp, with a decent blend of ripe pear and baking spice flavors paired with soft, smooth texture."
US,85.0,28.0,Rogue Valley,Agate Ridge,"This starts out well, with sniffs and sips of blackberries and black cherries. That fruit does a quick fade, and drying tannins quickly take over the thin finish."
US,93.0,56.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"Beautifuly integrated oak spice and a deep well of fruit flavors combine in this richly complex and layered wine. It's medium to full in body, supple and mouthfilling in texture, and brings a great array of classic aromas to the table. Dark cherry, forest floor, cedar and a hint of wood smoke meld into a feast of flavor."
US,86.0,10.0,California,Bogle,"Another Best Buy Merlot from Bogle. The wine is just as you want a nice Merlot to be, rich and soft and flavorful in cherries, with a kiss of smoky oak."
US,85.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Broman,"This Cab already has nearly five years on it, but it still has tough, bitter tannins. That raises the question: will it age? Fruit-wise, it's rich in blackberries, cherries and currants, with an exotic cassis finish. The acidity is crisp and zesty. But those acids and tannins are likely to outlive the fruit."
France,89.0,26.0,Bourgogne,Simon Bize,"This has a delicate citrus character and a tangy, minerally texture. The ripe fruits are balanced by acidity."
Italy,88.0,44.0,Colli della Toscana Centrale,Marchesi Gondi,"From a noble Italian family that has been making wine since the 13th century, this oak-aged Tuscan red displays a crisp, clean, linear style. It's a straightforward wine with immediate aromas of red berry, leather and spice."
US,88.0,12.0,Rogue Valley,Foris,"Eschewing new French oak entirely and with just 10% second fill, it's lightly aromatic with notes of apple and stone fruit. With no malolactic fermentation, the fruit flavors are medium-bodied and sweet, showing a sense of balance that carries through to the finish."
France,92.0,20.0,CÃ´tes du Tarn,Domaine D'en SÃ©gur,"Situated in the Tarn River valley, south of Cahors and west of Toulouse, this estate has turned towards Bordeaux in its choice of grapes. The wine has structure, tense tannins as well as black currant fruit flavors. It's a rich, generous wine, and with its acidity and firm background it will age. Drink from 2018."
US,93.0,56.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,McIntyre Vineyards,"Very few wines present such intense florality as does this bottling that smells like a potpourri sachet, full of dried violets, dried lavender and eucalyptus, with touches of dust, chipped slate and black plum. Those flowers carry to the palate as well, where lavender, blossoming thyme and green peppercorns show."
US,91.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Louis M. Martini,"Juicy tobacco, clove and black currant accent plush layers of integrated oak and rounded, persistent tannin in this Bordeaux-style blend. Full bodied and quite ripe, it's a nice showcase for Napa Valley fruit."
Canada,91.0,60.0,Okanagan Valley,Culmina,"This Bordeaux-style blend may strike those unfamiliar with Okanagan reds as tilting toward an astringent, tannic style, which many of these wines do. That said, it's complex and compelling, with an array of dried herbs, dried tobacco, dried fruits (cranberries and cherries) and dark chocolate. The granular tannins are ripe and supportive, with a finishing lick of espresso. It's best to decant this for a couple of hours before drinking."
France,84.0,13.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau les Berthets,"This is a lean wine, all tannins and missing fruit. It is dry and showing considerable hard extraction. It will soften, but not much."
Australia,87.0,45.0,Heathcote,Jasper Hill,"Minty and raisiny on the nose, with Port-like elements of dried fruit and high (15.0%) alcohol. Still, it shows the variety's trademark delicate structure and silky texture."
France,90.0,54.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"A very subdued nose leads to a rather earthy, dry palate where all the fruit hides behind some slightly rounded lemon freshness. There is gradually more apple fruit with some air and an earthy finish with a long, fresh, lemony tang."
France,84.0,10.0,Vin de France,La Vieille Ferme,"This delicate rosÃ© offers a subtle bouquet of muddled cherry, carnation and mentholated berry. The light and slightly astringent palate boasts tangy, tart notes of currant and lime rind that linger through the medium-length finish."
Italy,92.0,69.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenute Silvio Nardi,"Underbrush, red berry, scorched earth and dark spice aromas emerge in the glass. The structured, chewy palate offers mature black cherry, clove, ground pepper and star anise set in a firm framework of fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018??028."
US,91.0,110.0,Napa Valley,Silver Oak,"It's easy to see why Silver Oak remains so popular with the restaurant crowd. It's made in a more restrained style than many other Napa Cabs. There's plenty of berry and currant fruit as well as oak, but it's accompanied by tobacco and herbs that give the wine an earthiness. What the wine lacks in dazzle it more than makes up for in elegance and subtlety. Should develop well for at least a decade."
Italy,86.0,11.0,Toscana,Luiano,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with delicate aromas of violet and baking spice. The simple easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry and chopped herb alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon."
Italy,89.0,24.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Caparzo,"Aromas recall forest floor, violet, berries and a whiff of leather. The juicy fruit palate offers sour cherry, black raspberry and plum accented with hints of cinnamon-spice alongside polished tannins. It's ready, so drink soon."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Piedmont,Giacomo Vico,"Here's a ruby-colored sparkling dessert wine that would pair with chocolate-covered strawberries, panna cotta or apricot tart. Fruity and cheerful, aromas here include raspberry, white cherry and cranberry. Creamy foaming is capped by bright crispness to keep the mouth refreshed."
Spain,86.0,18.0,Toro,Telmo RodrÃ­guez,"Herbal blackberry and jammy black-plum aromas are forceful and brutish. This Toro has a hard, collapsed, jammy palate and overripe berry fruit flavors. A dense, chewy, baked finish is solid but lacks elegance."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Taurasi,I Capitani,"Alluring scents of fragrant blue flower, wild red berry, baking spice and new leather lift out of the glass. The chewy savory palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and vanilla framed in enveloping, velvety tannins that lend firm structure and polish. A hint of mocha backs up the finish. Drink 2019??029."
US,90.0,22.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"This is just the second time that this winery has released a Dolcetto, both sourced from the Dwelley vineyard. It's a very pretty wine, the color of Pinot Noir, and captures some of the feminine elegance of that grape as well. Scents of fresh crushed raspberries rise from the glass, lightly dusted with cocoa. Complex details of fresh herb add further interest."
US,91.0,39.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Soquel Vineyards,"Baked plum, red cherries, dried sage and a touch of gingerbread show on the nose of this appellation blend. Fresh and fruity red cherry and ripe pomegranate pop on the palate, where wet dirt, black sage and thyme combine for a very complex sip."
US,87.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Left Coast Cellars,"Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such. In fact, if anything, this seems to fall on the lighter side of Oregon Pinot Gris, without the thick and heavy fresh cut pear character that many of them bring. Pair this with chanterelles in a light cream sauce."
US,90.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Grassie,"ImpÃ©ratrice is the book-end companion to the Cab-dominated Courageux from William Grassie. Here, the Merlot dominates the blend, produced in a Right Bank style showing brambly, incense-laden aromatics. Smooth and silky in the mouth, the dark fruit core is surrounded with herb, pepper, coffee and brown spices."
US,92.0,20.0,El Dorado,Cedarville Vineyard,"An incredibly well-made and well-priced Viognier, from Cedarville's very own decomposed granite-filled soils high atop Fair Play. Opening with faint floral honey, wet stone and pear aromas, the flavors follow through accordingly, and the wine just continues to please with full-integrated minerality. It's a joy to drink."
US,91.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Sextant,"Sharp anise, violet and menthol scents swirl around a core of rich blackberry jam on this wine, hitting the palate with serious thickness. The Kamal, named after an 8th-century navigation device, also features the other four Bordeaux varietals. It delivers flavors of deep plum jelly, cherry syrup, pepper and cedar."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Barbera d'Alba,Tenuta Rocca,Here is a bright and chewy Barbera d'Alba with loads of ripe fruit and blackberry backed by thick density and bright freshness. This is the perfect wine to pair with homemade lasagna with cheese and sliced sausage.
US,91.0,21.0,Clements Hills,Bokisch,"Bokisch's 100% Monastrell is brooding with dark fruit?black cherries, currants and blackberries. It shows a cinnamon-swirled earth note and a layer of herb, with medium body. As such, it would be a beautiful wine with roasted meats like lamb or chicken that are swaddled in herbs or anise. The tannins are soft but structured enough to age."
France,93.0,169.0,Clos de Vougeot,Henri de Villamont,"This is a seriously structured, impressive wine that comes from a parcel in the center of the Clos de Vougeot. It is firm and solid?a powerhouse of richness and density?with dark tannins, ripe black fruits and tight acidity. With this kind of structure, the wine certainly needs to age, so don't drink before 2017."
France,85.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Bouchard AÃ®nÃ© & Fils,"All red fruit, red cherries and the lightest tannins. This is full-bodied and exuberant, with the typical acidity of young Beaujolais."
US,84.0,25.0,Virginia,Barboursville Vineyards,"At the moment, this Cabernet Franc's nose seems quite shy, offering only subtle notes of spice and dried herb. Medium in body, with a sense of grace, it has gentle flavors that are reminiscent of spiced cocoa and cherry."
US,93.0,60.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Boekenoogen,"This is the annual release of a small, isolated vineyard block that's dry-farmed and named for the winemaker. The unctuous bottling shows luxurious aromas of baked black cherries, cinnamon, clove, cream and a touch of iron. The rich dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, where the surrounding chaparral herbs invade the palate, offering dried sagebrush, eucalyptus and a wild mint sensation that last deep into the finish."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,Astorre Noti,Black currant and dark cherry sensations are accented with notes of espresso and roasted coffee bean. The subdued palate is already evolved and has an abrupt finish.
US,90.0,40.0,Willamette Valley,Le Cadeau,"Smooth and rich, the first release of the new vintage from Le Cadeau is a gem. Tangy berry/cherry fruit is framed in chocolate, while balancing acidity props up softer, caramel streaks. The finish brings a wash of citrus, leaving the mouth feeling clean and ready to sip again."
US,93.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Gramercy,"Hailing from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine offers reserved aromas of violets and raspberries along with whiffs of smoked meat and green herbs. The layered flavors are elegant yet intense, with vibrant acidity and a finish with plenty of hang time. The pleasure is as much about feel as flavor."
US,89.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"Rich, ripe and flashy, this Cabernet scores high on the deliciousness factor. That is Peju's speciality, and here they have produced a gorgeous wine of soft tannins, creaminess and ripe black currant, anise and dark chocolate flavors. Tasty now, and will stay fresh for up to five years."
Italy,91.0,85.0,Barolo,Ciabot Berton,"Intense aromas of chopped mint, baking spice, graphite and red fruit emerge in the glass. The firm, elegant palate displays ripe black cherry, raspberry confiture, licorice and ground pepper framed in velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2018??2028."
US,90.0,50.0,Sonoma County,Rock Wall,"High-toned red fruit stars in this wine, a nice showing of the sought-after vineyard site atop Moon Mountain. Soft, elegant and integrated in terms of tannin and oak, it retains the structure and acidity to age well and take on additional complexity. Drink now through 2020."
Argentina,87.0,16.0,Mendoza,Aymara,"A mix of spice, oak, tomato, plum and rubbery aromas announce a palate that blends plump ripeness with pulling tannins. Dry, spicy plum and berry flavors are steady on the finish."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Il Falchetto,"Warm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of espresso, fig, dried berry, toasted oak and clove. The dense palate offers raisin, oak, roasted coffee bean and spearmint alongside round tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol."
US,88.0,68.0,Santa Maria Valley,Migration,"Gravelly aromas of wet slate meet with dark cranberry and baked red cherry on the nose of this bottling, which the Duckhorn crew sources from this historic vineyard. The palate is relatively light with very earthy flavors, showing tangy red fruit, thyme and wet soil flavors."
Australia,87.0,29.0,Padthaway,Stonehaven,"A richer, yet no better, style than the 2000 Limestone Coast bottling. Peach and vanilla aromas and flavors take the lead, with buttered popcorn and alcoholic warmth playing supporting roles. The finish is long, featuring a slightly bitter note akin to citrus rind."
US,90.0,26.0,Long Island,The Grapes of Roth,"Similarly to it's Virgin Berry sibling, Roth's regular label Dry Riesling has a distinctly green, woodsy tone lending an alpine feel to sweet-tart peach and apricot flavors. It's brisk and fine-footed, yet zesty tangerine and grapefruit acidity persist long on the finish."
US,86.0,45.0,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,Imagery,"A newer appellation straddling both Sonoma and Mendocino counties, Pine Mountain has some unusual plantings, including Lagrein, more often found in Italy. This one, from the highest elevation vineyard in Sonoma County, is plummy and robust, not terribly high in acidity."
US,87.0,26.0,Willamette Valley,J. Scott Cellars,"This falls on the light side, with appealing flavors of strawberry and cherry candy. The tannins are just thick enough to give an edge. It's rare to find vineyard-designated Pinots in this price range."
US,92.0,60.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foley,"This well-balanced Pinot Noir shows red-cherry fruit, with complex hints of anise, star anise, thyme and even tarragon on the nose. Both the acidity and tannic structure are lively but not aggressive, carrying tart cherry flavors deep into the finish."
US,82.0,14.0,New Mexico,St. Clair,"Exuberantly perfumed with notes of honey, tangerine and orange flowers, this rich, sweet sparkler is effusive on the palate as well with flavors of ripe melon, fruit cocktail and peach gummy candy."
Spain,87.0,21.0,Rioja,Quasar,"This Crianza has leathery aromas, a tannic mouthfeel and roasted, spicy red berry flavors. It's dry, oaky and not particularly ripe."
Argentina,85.0,10.0,Mendoza,Finca El Retiro,"Melted fudge and asphalt are draped on this young wine's bouquet. Given that opening, a palate of black plum and cassis isn't surprising. Feelwise, it's a touch rough and tannic, which is probably to be expected. Turns more herbal the more you sniff and swirl."
France,85.0,16.0,Vin de France,FranÃ§ois Lurton,"This wine is light and perfumed, with crisp red currants and a tangy orange-zest texture. It dances from the glass, refreshing and poised to finish."
US,93.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Family,"Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this is a light, ethereal and lovely sparkling wine, faintly pink in hue with high-toned, nuanced layers of red cherry and orange. This is one to enjoy on its own or at the table, picnic blanket or tailgating from the back of a truck, preferably with soft cheeses."
France,92.0,53.0,Pernand-Vergelesses,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Structured and fruity, this has plenty of minerality to pair with the crisp citrus flavor. The wood influence gives it extra depth, while the crispness is preserved by a final steely thrust. This structured wine should age for four years or more"
Spain,85.0,11.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Bodegas Navarro LÃ³pez,"This blend is crisp and reasonably well focused on the bouquet. In the mouth, the wine is rubbery and tannic feeling, with mild astringency and flavors of generic berry fruit, oak and herbs. Good for basic occasions."
US,88.0,18.0,Monticello,Lovingston,"This is an intriguing Merlot-dominant blend, with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage. Engaging aromas of red plum and currant take on savory herbal notes of thyme and rooibos. The plush, silky palate houses soft, mellow tannins and vibrant acidity, with flavors matching the nose. Contemplative yet approachable, enjoy this alongside a plate of charcuterie and hard cheese."
US,83.0,26.0,Alexander Valley,Sebastiani,"There's a bland greenness to this wine that delves into waxy blackberry and plum, but ultimately remains flat on the palate."
Italy,94.0,100.0,Bolgheri Superiore,Campo alla Sughera,"Arnione, a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot, packs heat and intensity and is a beautifully integrated and generous wine. Thick extraction is accented by chocolate, cherry, leather, cigar, liquid vanilla and root beer. It's tight in the mouth with bright fruit flavors. Drink after 2015."
Canada,91.0,18.0,Okanagan Valley,Township 7,"Opening with classic peavine aromas, this is a bright, fleshy and pungent wine that should delight fans of Loire Valley-style Sauvignon Blancs. Rich, cascading flavors of fig, pear, grapefruit and star fruit keep the mouthfeel lively. Just 10% was barrel-fermented, the rest in stainless."
France,91.0,50.0,Anjou,Clau de Nell,"This is a rich, smoky red-fruit-flavored wine. One of three wines produced by the estate that was created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy, it is made from biodynamically grown grapes. Wood aged, it shows spice as well as the cool fruitiness that gives the wine both its crispness and aging potential. Drink from 2018."
US,93.0,29.0,Southern Oregon,DanCin,"Ripe and luscious, this coats the mouth with a mÃ©lange of juicy apples and peaches. That initial hit is followed up with a wash of buttery, toasted nuts, and finally kissed away with a lick of wet stone. It's creamy and rich without ever being tiring."
France,84.0,37.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,ChÃ¢teau d'Or et de Gueules,"Made solely from old-vine Carignan, this wine does stand out as being unique among a flight of CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®me wines. It's slightly pruny, marked by dried fruit, leather and clove, turning a touch metallic on the finish."
US,88.0,13.0,California,Angeline,"Crisp and dry, this bright pink wine is classically styled, showing apple skin aromas and lively grapefruit flavors. Made from Pinot Noir, it's light and appetizing and has a solid, mildly grippy mouthfeel."
France,94.0,69.0,Champagne,Boizel,"Disgorged in October 2014, this smooth, now mature, wine has flavors of yeasty toastiness and a tight, mineral structure. Sliced apple and lemon zest still give freshness. Behind the fruit, crisp texture and a steely edge await. It is beautifully balanced, rich while dry and ready to drink."
Italy,86.0,90.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Tommaso Bussola,"There's a muddled element to the nose here that recalls old wood or spice and in general, this wine lacks sharpness and focus. It tastes very sweet and offers high alcohol that keeps the palate ripping clean."
US,88.0,102.0,Napa Valley,World's End,"A brawny, super-sized blend of 40% Syrah, 35% Petit Verdot and 25% Cabernet Franc, this comes from Atlas Peak's Stagecoach Vineyard. Dense black fruit, tar, brick and bacon define this wine, which is full bodied and leathery on the palate."
Spain,88.0,10.0,Rueda,Analivia,"Here's a dry, crisp, apple-and-citrus Verdejo that's stony and good from head to toe. In the mouth, it's wet, juicy and biting, while the flavors of green fruits, lemon, celery, fresh lettuce and sweet bell pepper are tangy and fresh. Quite nice for a 100,000-case, $10 quaffer."
US,89.0,12.0,Lodi,Gnarly Head,"Intensely ripe, jammy and toasty aromas and equally effusive fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It seems to overflow with boysenberry and blackberry, and has a touch of wood smoke from oak."
Argentina,83.0,11.0,Mendoza,DiseÃ±o,"Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes."
Italy,88.0,55.0,Toscana,Viticcio,"Prunaio delivers aromas of prune, rum cake and cherry liqueur. The fruit is dark and savory, and there's an aged, almost gritty quality to the mouthfeel."
US,87.0,22.0,North Coast,Edge,"Made from a blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot and 11% Syrah this herbal Cab divulges peppercorn on the nose as well as cola, leather and cedar. With structured tannins that don't get in the way, it's food-friendly and yet hearty, well-priced for the quality, with a finish of ripe blueberry and raspberry."
US,88.0,36.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Boekenoogen,"The point of this semisweet bottling is a little unclear, but it offers a beautifully rich nose of honeysuckle, buttercream, white peach, almond paste and flint. The palate is rich, creamy and quite sweet, with peach, melon and mango flavors. Consider it as a light dessert wine or a pairing for spicy foods."
US,90.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Gallo Signature Series,"The signature on the bottle is Gina Gallo's, and what a lovely Cabernet this is. It's rich, brimming with black currants, cocoa and oak, and the tannins are as smooth as velvet. Tastes so delicious now, there's no reason not to drink it up."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Villa Poggio Salvi,"Here's a structured Rosso that offers aromas of underbrush, black plum, berry and orange zest. Bright red cherry takes center stage on the palate, while notes of mint, Mediterranean herbs and sweet spices add interest. It's tannic but shy on fresh acidity so enjoy now."
US,95.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Hall,"Outstanding for its purity, and the incredibly fine tannins, not to mention the compelling flavors. Black and red cherries, currants, cola, mushrooms, cedar, anise, and spice flavors mingle into a long, rich finish. So balanced and elegant. Made from 95% Sacrashe Vineyard fruit, in the Rutherford AVA."
US,89.0,19.0,Paso Robles,Tower 15,"With a very light, almost water-like color, this offers expectedly light aromas of honey and a tiny bit of nectarine flesh. It's also quite dainty on the palate, with lemon blossom water elements emerging mid-palate that evolve toward lemon pith, Japanese pear and a lingering finish. Altogether, it's quite interesting."
US,94.0,38.0,Santa Maria Valley,Tantara,"Superrich, ripe and flamboyant, if not particularly subtle. Dazzles for its tsunami of grilled pineapple custard, pear tart, golden mango and Key lime pie richness, accented with sweetly, caramelized oak, and brightened with brisk acidity. A racy, decadent crowd pleaser."
US,86.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Hendry,"There's lots of ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry fruits in this Petit Verdot-based blend. It's dry, robust, spicy and a little rustic. Drink it now with pizza or a burger."
US,86.0,29.0,Sonoma County,Landmark,"Dry and crisp in cool-climate coastal acidity, this polished Chard shows pretty flavors of pineapples, green apples, honey and oak spice. It's creamy, and made in the New World style."
US,87.0,56.0,Yorkville Highlands,Williams Selyem,"Weir has never been my favorite Williams Selyem Pinot, although it has its fans. The ??5, as with previous vintages, is dry and tannic, showing a toughness that's almost rustic. The flavors are of cherries, cassis, cola, balsamic-splashed sautÃ©ed wild mushrooms and dusty spices. Could do interesting things over the years."
US,91.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Vagabond,"From the Caldwell Vineyard in Carneros, this 100% varietal, RhÃ´ne-inspired wine is smoky, like a great outdoor barbecue, with dense elements of black pepper and gunpowder. Balanced, weighty and dense, it peaks in pomegranate, providing a tartness to the proceedings, particularly the finish. Drink now through 2020."
US,86.0,21.0,Santa Barbara County,Bianchi,"Crisp acidity saves the day for this ripe, fruity young Pinot Grigio. It has forward flavors of pineapples, limes, kiwis and vanilla that are almost, but not quite, sweet. Then the acidity kicks in, drying and cleansing the finish."
Italy,96.0,80.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Milziade Antano,"Rich and concentrated, this gorgeous, terroir-driven wine opens with aromas of crushed blue flower, graphite, plum and pipe tobacco. The powerful but weightless palate weaves together ripe black cherry, blackberry, clove, black pepper and mineral while velvety tannins offer support. Drink 2016??035."
US,88.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Michael Florentino,"Two thirds Grenache, the rest a mix of Tempranillo, Syrah and Counoise, this smooth and fruity red has a pleasing, lively mouthfeel. It carries a hint of moist, clean earth, and finishes with a lick of mocha."
Italy,87.0,93.0,Barolo,Marchesi di Barolo,"Aromas of weedy underbrush, toast, menthol and cherry marinated in spirits emerge in the glass. The palate shows raw sour cherry and a hint of licorice alongside raspy tannins that dry out the finish."
Spain,87.0,11.0,Rioja,Rio Madre,"Jammy aromas of red berries, red licorice sticks and green herbs filter toward a pinched mouthfeel with creamy oak for an offset. Flavors of boysenberry are dilute but fresh and friendly. Overall, this is good and easy but simple, with gaps in its fiber."
US,87.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,Seven Falls,"Aromas of flowers, green herb, pear and peach lead to silky sleek stone-fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but the fruit doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened."
Italy,94.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Il Marroneto,"Elegant and structured, this offers enticing scents suggesting wild berry, pressed flower, chopped herb and baking spice. The refined palate delivers ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, star anise and tobacco alongside tightly knit, refined tannins. It's tempting to drink now but it will be even better in a few more years. Drink 2019??026."
Italy,97.0,140.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona,"Aromas of wild berry, forest floor, new leather, grilled herb, menthol and dark spice all come together on this full-bodied red. The structured palate is still young but shows great depth, offering mature black cherry, tobacco, clove and licorice framed in youthfully assertive tannins that give it an age-worthy structure. Drink 2022??040."
US,88.0,38.0,Willamette Valley,City Winery of New York,"Spicy berry, chocolate and bitter greens are in play, though slightly muted. The components smooth out and surf into a broad, easygoing finish. Drink up."
US,87.0,18.0,Santa Barbara County,Toccata,"Straddles the line between dry and off dry, with honeyed orange and vanilla flavors. Feels nice and clean, with a fine bite of acidity. Lovely with slightly sweet, smoky sausages and ham."
US,89.0,44.0,Russian River Valley,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative,"Sweet oak and upfront raspberry- and cherry-jam flavors mark this Pinot. It's not particularly complex, but it is delicious, and the brisk acidity make it shiny and clean in the mouth."
France,88.0,35.0,Champagne,Vollereaux,"This ripe, soft wine is well balanced and offers attractive fruitiness. The creamy mousse and acidity bring richness and a fresh character. With its finely judged dosage, not too dry, not too sweet, the wine is very ready to drink."
US,88.0,15.0,Mendocino,Tangley Oaks,"Aromas like a pastry shop and ripe pear and sweet apple flavors make this wine easy to like. Smoothly textured, it is medium bodied and the balance is rather soft."
US,88.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Novy,"Great price for a Syrah this good, from this esteemed producer. While it doesn't have the complexity of Novy's single-vineyard Syrahs, it's drily elegant, with complex blackberry, cola, herb and pepper flavors that shift in the glass as the wine airs. Drink now."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Etna,Girolamo Russo,"Delicate and sophisticated, this has notes of wild berry, rosemary, crushed stone, tobacco and spice that are delivered with slow, beautiful intensity. The wine shows freshness, structure and staying power."
US,87.0,13.0,California,Kendall-Jackson,"Fresh, lively and brimming over with fruit flavor, from lemon to lime to peach. The appearance is light gold, the aromas are very immediate and effusive, the texture tangy and the finish light with a hint of sweetness."
France,84.0,15.0,Bordeaux,Cheval Quancard,"The wine feels light and very soft. There are some attractive red berry fruits, along with acidity and wood flavors, but the tannic structure is hardly there. It's an enjoyable, lightweight wine to drink now through 2016."
Spain,93.0,90.0,Ribera del Duero,Cepa 21,"Ripe aromas of cola nut, burnt brown sugar, cedar and blackberry feed into a giant palate with killer tannins. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and burnt toast end in a tarry pool of black-fruit flavors and monster tannins. This is rewarding now but also punishing; hold until 2017, then drink through 2025."
US,88.0,28.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"This is oily and ripe, with plenty of butter, butterscotch and toasty new oak. What elevates it, as with all Pacific Northwest Chardonnays, is the extra acidity, that provides a foundation of support under the lush fruit and generous new oak. It might smooth out a bit over the next couple of years, but it's a wine built to be savored sooner rather than later."
France,86.0,17.0,Bourgogne AligotÃ©,Manuel Olivier,This soft wine shows some of the AligotÃ© crispness that has become creamy and smooth. There are touches of yellow fruits as well as lively acidity and a gentle aftertaste. Drink now.
US,93.0,48.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"The Vineyard Select is made only on occasion. As in 2006, the cuvÃ©e includes a splash of Petit Verdot. From the extraordinary 2007 vintage, this wine has it all: depth, polish and panache. The richly fruity nose brings on the berries and cherries; they fill the palate and add layers of fig, plum, chocolate and coconut."
US,92.0,25.0,Oak Knoll District,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,"This impressive bottling is brightly substantial and tensely textured, lively in acidity and yet brimming with complexity. Stony lemon and peach ride a fruitful wave of flavor and find balance between sweet ripeness and memorable crispness."
Spain,87.0,18.0,Cava,MarquÃ©s de Gelida,"Dusty red-fruit aromas set up an easy, likable palate with a mix of citrus and briny apple flavors. There's good tang and acidity along with length to the finish. That briny character from the flavor profile comes back on the finish."
US,87.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Keuka Lake Vineyards,"The nose on Keuka Lake's Evergreen Lek Vineyard is wonderfully intriguing with dark notes of smoke, petrol and brine accented by hits of ripe, yellow peach. Dry on the palate with nuances of dark steel, smoke and orange peel, this medium-bodied Riesling is brightened by a flash of fresh orange acidity and sweet grapefruit pith on the finish."
US,92.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Pride Mountain,"Aged in 25% new French oak, the rest of it neutral, this age-worthy Chardonnay shows refreshing restraint, though it retains plenty of fruit. The aromas tend toward faint caramel and a complex web of acidity and brightness accompanies notes of apple and pear, a long finish capping things off."
US,85.0,20.0,Central Coast,Jason-Stephens,"The nose of this light-colored wine offers showy apple blossom and pineapple aromas, leaning into the ripe and tropical side of the grape spectrum. it delivers crisp energy once sipped, with very fruit-forward apple flavors and even a touch of guava."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Luiano,"Enticing scents of rose, moist soil, plum, raspberry and dark spice meld together in the glass. The lively palate shows fleshy black cherry, mocha, vanilla and a licorice note alongside zesty acidity. Fine-grained tannins give it a polished finish."
US,88.0,32.0,Russian River Valley,Loring Wine Company,"Succulent pomegranate, persimmon and raspberry flavors make this wine an instant delight. The richness is brightened by tart acidity, while oak brings just the right touch of buttered cinnamon toast. A lovely Pinot Noir for drinking now with upscale fare."
France,93.0,46.0,Chablis,Domaine Billaud-Simon,"Produced from a 7-acre parcel within the premier cru, this wine is tight and nervy at this young stage. It has acidity, a tangy mineral texture and crisp white and citrus fruit but needs time to fill out and show its full potential. Drink from 2021."
Italy,91.0,29.0,Sicilia,Feudo Arancio,"Hekate, made with a blend of aromatic grapes from Sicily, is a rich and decadent wine that opens with a luminous amber color and intense aromas of candied orange, sweet almond paste, dried flowers, peach and honeysuckle. The wine is thick and dense with crisp citrus flavors and would pair with crÃ¨me caramel."
Italy,85.0,24.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Fornacina,"This opens with aromas of underbrush, toasted nut and grilled herb. The extremely simple, abrupt palate offers suggestions of sour cherry and orange zest alongside brisk acidity."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Cava,Segura Viudas,"Yeasty aromas include briny notes of citrus and stone fruits, while on the palate, this is tangy and tight. Flavors of briny citrus, pickle and kimchee are zesty on a finish. This is not clean like polished crystal; funk and brine are key players on this Cava."
France,92.0,100.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau Pichon Longueville,"This is a powerful statement of ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. It has rich concentrated fruit, with ripe but dry tannins and considerable wood flavors. It is stylish, with layers of acidity and wood complementing the fruit."
US,90.0,90.0,Sonoma Coast,Flowers,"This light, elegant wine is perfumed like a rose garden, joined by lavender and dried herb. Its light take is supported by integrated tannin and a lurking tease of smoky meat and toasted oak that adds savoriness to its ethereal character."
Spain,87.0,45.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Mauro,"Starts with aromas of beef jerky, licorice and berry syrup. It's a brawny, dark wine with jammy blackberry flavors along with chocolate cake and thick, grabbing tannins. Finishes sweet and syrupy, with heavy saturation and big tannins. Not in perfect balance and by no means a great wine from Mauro. But it's still good for an off year. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines."
Italy,91.0,38.0,Trento,Ferrari,"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of apricot, hazelnut and citrus. The bright palate delivers white peach, lemon zest and a note of just-baked vanilla cookies alongside accents of cinnamon and nut. Small, continuous bubbles give an elegant texture."
France,88.0,12.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Sorin,"From vineyards near Bandol, close to the Mediterranean coast, this full and fruity wine has a lighter side with its fresh acidity. Red berry flavors are cut with a lemon zest texture, the aftertaste bright and refreshing with its acidity. The blend is 30% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 15% Cinsault, 15% MourvÃ¨dre, 15% Carignan, 10% Rolle and 2% Ugni Blanc."
US,86.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Sonoma Smith,"A savory wine made in a slightly sweet style that has flavors of pineapples, peaches, and vanilla oak. Acidity is all-important for balance.The blend is 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% SÃ©millon."
France,90.0,29.0,Vacqueyras,Alain Jaume et Fils,"A perennially attention-worthy wine, the Jaume family's Grande Garrigue Vacqueyras combines bold black cherry fruit with spicy notes suggestive of licorice root and bay leaf. It's full bodied and round in the mouth, but the fruit remains fresh, ending on a mouthwatering note of acidity. Drink now??018."
US,88.0,150.0,Napa Valley,Madrigal,"A tiny-production wine at the producer's higher end of pricing and intent, this offers juicy red fruit around dense, sizable tannins that are on the way to being integrated and resolved. There's a softness on the palate and it finishes with a note of cinnamon."
US,90.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Carol Shelton,"A color so deep it could be a Pinot Noir, flavors bursting with plum and wild blackberry and a velvety texture make this dry rosÃ© taste more like a red. Bucking the trend toward lightness, it has medium body, a creamy mouthfeel and lingering finish."
US,92.0,48.0,Willamette Valley,Big Table Farm,"This elegant wine is spicy and aromatic, with pretty floral highlights. Orange peel, rosewater, cherry soda and clean, refreshing acidity are all in play. The lingering finish is a bonus."
US,88.0,13.0,Amador County,Karly,"A really great mountain Zinfandel that shows luscious power and fruit at a fair price. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, oranges, cloves and white pepper flood the palate and are just wonderful to experience. At this price, buy this Zin by the case."
US,89.0,45.0,Stags Leap District,Robert Mondavi,"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux. Black cherry and licorice are the predominant flavors, and in the end game there's a subdued coffee-tinged, reserved character to it."
Australia,83.0,14.0,Bendigo,Water Wheel,"Thick and pulpy on the palate, this white is fruity and simple, with pear, melon and citrus aromas and flavors. It's surprisingly heavy for such a low-alcohol (12.7%) wine."
Australia,92.0,75.0,Yarra Valley,Yarra Yering,"A Yarra Valley classic, Dry Red No. 1 is a Bordeaux-style blend marked by its restrained alcohol levels yet potent flavors. The 2007 features scents of tobacco, vanilla and cassis, with a hint of tomato emerging on the palate. It's medium-bodied, with a long finish that finishes with firm but silky tannins and lip-smacking cassis. Approachable now, but should age well for 10??5 years."
France,89.0,40.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Calvimont,"From the owners of ChÃ¢teau de CÃ©rons, this wine is rich with tropical fruit flavors and toasty from wood-aging. It's warm and ripe, its smoothly textured SÃ©millon lifted by Sauvignon Blanc. Drink now."
France,90.0,30.0,Minervois,ChÃ¢teau Cabezac,"Although this blend of 75% Syrah, 15% MourvÃ¨dre and 10% Grenache spends 18 months in French oak, the outcome is surprisingly balanced and elegant, with gorgeous mineral notes to the bouquet alongside earthy spice, garrigue and ripe red berries. Everything transitions seamlessly to the smooth mouth, with a silky structure that provides a bit of grip to the close. Drink now through 2014."
US,87.0,20.0,Oregon,A to Z,"Tart and spicy, this is loaded with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, lightly dusted with accents of cocoa powder. The result is a pretty, slightly candied, ready-to-drink Pinot Noir."
US,90.0,17.0,Mendocino,Navarro,"Sometimes a Sauvignon Blanc this dry, acidic and low in alcohol can be unbalanced, but this one hits it out of the park. With tastes of citrus zest, white peach, green apple and spice, it's just a beautiful apÃ¨ritif wine, and also is ideal supporting roast chicken, bruschetta with chÃ¨vre, and grilled veggies."
US,91.0,25.0,Mount Veeder,Mayacamas,"A terrific Sauvignon Blanc, this is Mayacamas's best in years. Bone dry and rich in mouthwatering acidity, it shows subtle layers of lemons, limes, oranges and spices, with a bitter grassiness that gives it a perfect bite."
US,90.0,18.0,Lake County,Wildhurst,"Abundant flavors and fresh-tasting acidity come together in this full-bodied wine to form a complete, complex package. Yes, there is a vivid streak of vanilla and nutmeg from aging in all American oak barrels but the ripe apple flavors and underlying crispness keep those from overwhelming."
US,86.0,35.0,Knights Valley,Rock Wall,"This is a rich, ripe and tropical white, with a mix of sweetness and salinity that plays well off each other. It becomes simple on the finish."
US,87.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Barnard Griffin,"Streaks of citrus, berry and cracker are integrated with light berry flavors. This is a smooth, balanced, easy-drinking Syrah, with light hints of tea leaves."
US,94.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Guarachi Family,"Velvety smooth, this wine seduces from the get-go, robust in black fruit, tea and delicate offerings of rose petal and lavender. Intensely full bodied, it retains a balance of bright, natural acidity that tames the spicy tannin."
US,91.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,de Lancellotti,"This outstanding value is sharp and precise, its black-cherry fruit holding down a compact core, annotated with streaks of coffee, truffle and chocolate. It punches well above its price, and should drink nicely into the early 2020s."
US,87.0,25.0,Leelanau Peninsula,Shady Lane,"A blend of 57% Cabernet Franc, 26% BlaufrÃ¤nkish and 17% Merlot, this estate wine is overtly floral on the nose, with violet and earthy geranium on a bed of red berries. The palate is racy and lithe from pulsing acidity, yet flavors of juicy blueberry and red currant prevail and ultimately the grippy tannins balance it out."
US,88.0,24.0,Wahluke Slope,Fielding Hills,"This pale peach, lightly bricked wine brings aromas of strawberry and melon rind. It drinks dry with a broad feel and fruit flavors that linger."
Spain,86.0,22.0,La Mancha,El Vinculo,"Full, pushy aromas of stewed plum, tomato, herbs and heavy oak come in front of a high-acid palate with salty flavors of herbal red plum, oregano, basil and tomato. A saline character sits heavily on the wine's chunky finish."
US,90.0,19.0,San Benito County,Le P'tit Paysan,"Venturing into the orange side of the rosÃ© color rainbow, this MourvÃ¨dre-based wine?with 13% Grenache?brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped. It's a revealing look at the potential of the overlooked Central Coast vineyards that winemaker Ian Brand diligently seeks out, both for his personal labels and the many for which he consults."
US,88.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"Quite grassy and brisk in style, this wine releases generous aromas of cut tennis ball, wet cement and sour limes. That citrusy acidity and sour-grass energy picks up lime pith, green-apple skins and a touch of white pepper on the palate, a very classic profile."
US,90.0,21.0,Willamette Valley,Panache Cellars,"This fragrant wine from an excellent vintage offers terrific value. Silky and potent, it features mixed flavors of berries, cherries, cola and mocha, with a dash of white pepper."
US,85.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Murrieta's Well,"A blend of 60% SÃ©millon and 40% Sauvignon Blanc, this is barrel-fermented, with the SÃ©millon component being put through malolactic fermentation. The result is a medium-bodied white with a smoky, buttery bouquet and flavors of peach, passion fruit and grapefruit. Drink now."
France,86.0,10.0,Ventoux,Ravoire et Fils,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, this medium- to full-bodied red features bright aromas of cherry, herb, chocolate and espresso, but turns dry and dusty-textured on the finish. Drink now."
France,86.0,13.0,Vin de Pays CitÃ© de Carcassonne,Laroque,"This unoaked Chardonnay offers bright aromas of red apple and white peach, laced with the faintest hint of hay and yellow flower. It's light and zippy on the palate, with a lemon-lime freshness and a green plum flavor that results in a tart and refreshing finish."
France,84.0,55.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Thuron,"The 2004 vintage is certainly mature, but with a light touch it is still attractive to drink. Mushroom and spice are lifted by juicy acidity. The dryness at the end shows it is ready to drink."
US,88.0,30.0,Santa Clara Valley,Jason-Stephens,"Lime pith, sharp gray slate, steel and a warmer lemon-curd aroma show on the nose of this wine from a region between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. Apples and pear-skin bitterness mark the palate that grows riper through the sip."
US,87.0,38.0,Lake County,Zina Hyde Cunningham,"Offers a blast of blackberries, black cherries, plums, mulberries and all kinds of other stone fruits and berries, in a dry wine structured with fine tannins. Drink this full-bodied wine with steak."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Costa Toscana,Duemani,"A blend of bio-dynamically grown Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, blue flowers, espresso, grilled herbs and baking spice. The bright palate delivers blackberry extract, spiced blueberry, tobacco, coffee, sage and licorice. Firm tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016??022."
France,85.0,14.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Perrin & Fils,"A blend of Grenache and Syrah, this is slightly minty upfront, followed by bright cherry flavors. It's on the light side for a CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne, but fresh and silky in texture, with just a hint of chocolaty richness on the finish."
Spain,87.0,13.0,Rueda,Cyatho,"Textbook Verdejo aromas of tangerine, passion fruit and grapefruit are simple and clean. A light, zesty, slightly spritzy palate frames flavors of grapefruit, lemon and orange pith. A mix of tropical and citrus notes drives a snappy but ordinary finish."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Piave,Tenuta SantomÃ¨,"SantomÃ¨ is a pretty expression of Raboso (a native grape of northeast Italy) with mouth-coating tannins and bright aromas of black cherry, old leather, spice and clove. That firm structure suggests a pairing with succulent red meat."
US,87.0,38.0,Sonoma Coast,Hirsch,"An aroma like red-apple skin and modest red cherry and plum flavors make a good combination in this medium-bodied, subtly styled wine. It tastes dry, nicely crisp, yet smooth in texture."
France,91.0,26.0,Sancerre,Domaine Girard,"With lees aging, this wine has gained richness, balancing crisp acidity with ripe flavors. Aromatic and with a flinty texture and citrus flavors, the wine is concentrated. The finish shows more of the herbal Sauvignon character."
US,87.0,14.0,Lodi,Peirano,"Lusty and robust, this Cab, Merlot and Syrah blend combines peppery, briary flavors with riper fruit notes of blackberries and plums. The texture is especially appealing, with its rich, complex tannins, from both the grapes and from oak. Good job in a dry red wine at a fair price."
US,93.0,48.0,Napa Valley,C. Beck,"Fancy and easy to drink now for its soft tannins and elegant mouthfeel. Flavors of blackberries, black currants, black cherries, dark chocolate, herbs and sweet tobacco flood the mouth, and are complex and flattering. But the tannins are such that time in the cellar is recommended. Now??012."
Italy,88.0,70.0,Barolo,Cascina Adelaide,"This has subdued aromas suggesting aromatic herb, forest floor, truffle and a whiff of leather. It's assertive and rather lean in terms of fruit richness, displaying sour cherry, pomegranate, espresso, clove and a note of powdered sage. Tight, grainy tannins leave a firm finish."
US,90.0,45.0,North Fork of Long Island,Bedell,"This is a pristinely fruity yet vivacious sparkling rosÃ©. It's deft in body and scintillatingly crisp, offering layers of tart red-apple and raspberry flavors. Fine delicate froth and persistent bubbles set it apart, as does its long sugar-cookie finish."
Italy,95.0,75.0,Sant'Antimo,Col d'Orcia,"Olmaia is a pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that hits all the right marks. You can taste the variety's natural flavors but they never seem green or medicinal. Instead the wine is plush, soft, round and opulent, with ideal harmony and balance and beautiful delivery of chocolate, cherry, vanilla and herbal aromas. The wine almost exaggerates, if possible, its generosity and roundness."
US,92.0,42.0,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma-Cutrer,"With a touch of barrel reduction on the nose, this wine unfolds into layers of crisp, stony minerality and bold flavors of lemon and pear. Balanced in both ripeness and texture, its acidity carries it to a long, spicy finish."
France,88.0,30.0,Pernand-Vergelesses,Domaine Luc et Lise Pavelot,"This is a firm style of wine, showing the mineral character of Pernand-Verglesses reds. The wine has a nervy, almost herbal profile, showing red currants and considerable acidity."
US,88.0,25.0,Washington,Kiona,"Green herb, wood spice, tobacco, black cherry, cocoa and lemon twist aromas lead to generous dark-cherry flavors. It shows a touch of astringency but still brings plenty of enjoyment."
Spain,94.0,70.0,PenedÃ¨s,Torres,"This Cabernet Sauvignon from PenedÃ¨s is on the money. A smooth, creamy nose of vanilla, oak and berry aromas leads to a ripe, saturated palate with a meaty texture. Flavors of black fruits, wild herbs, licorice and spice are long, savory and chocolaty on a finish that lasts three minutes. Drink from 2019??030."
US,90.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"Made from vines planted in 1965, David Hill's estate Riesling is aromatic and textural, with an interesting, nuanced character that brings apples, peaches, pears and passion fruit flavors in profusion. Despite 1.8% residual sugar, it has plenty of acid and alcohol, finishing with a creamy, lemony fade."
Italy,91.0,47.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Mocali,"Soft tones of toasted almond, cinnamon, nutmeg and espresso make for a bold and powerful bouquet. There's ample fruit, presented as dried blackberry and cassis, that gives the wine the heft it needs to support the tight tannic structure and acidity. Sour cherry flavors drive the lively finish."
France,88.0,14.0,Gaillac,Georges Vigouroux,"A crisp and fruity blend of the herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc and the creamy Loin de l'Oeil, this has apple and grapefruit flavors. It has a bright feel, with a hint of mineral on the finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Benessere,"Made from 100% Muscat di Canelli grapes, retaining 9.5% residual sugar, this is a perfumed dessert wine, reminiscent of GewÃ¼rztraminer in its lychee aromas. It remains balanced and light on the palate, not overly sweet."
US,93.0,38.0,Carneros,Baldacci,"This is powerful in tropical fruit, apricot and oak flavors, but balanced with acidity and a tangy, minerally taste of stones. Rich and evocative, it appeals to the senses while retaining a complex intellectual charm. Drink now with lobster or crab dishes, especially a rich, buttery risotto."
US,86.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Red Newt Cellars,"Subdued on the nose with hints of apple, pear and wet stones, this semi-sweet wine is stark and lean on the palate with flavors of pressed apple and lemons. It's refreshing and easy drinking with a tight, light-footed frame."
US,90.0,20.0,Lake County,Shannon Ridge,"Beefy aromas and flavors complement ample blackberry and cranberry notes in this firm-textured, well-balanced and nicely layered wine that's based on Zinfandel and Syrah. It's concentrated without being too full bodied, with good length on the finish."
Italy,90.0,120.0,Bolgheri Superiore,Michele Satta,"Aromas of ripe blackcurrant, grilled bell pepper and allspice mingle in the glass. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah and 10% Teroldego, the palate offers prune, dried blackberry, graphite, ground black pepper and cocoa alongside polished tannins. This has already reached its peak drinking window so enjoy soon."
US,95.0,40.0,Santa Barbara County,Palmina,"Not only is this appellation blend the cheaper Nebbiolo offered by Steve Clifton's Italian varietal-focused winery, it's the best right out of the bottle. Bright strawberry, sweet rose, leather, star anise, cardamom, black-cherry-laced gingerbread and vanilla show on the rich and full nose. The tannins part to open dried strawberry, plum, rose hip and earthy flavors, proving both manly in presence but feminine in delicacy."
US,84.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Parkers Estate,"A little sharp and green, but give it a fatty steak or ribs and it will do just fine. Just needs some protein to wake up the blackberry and cherry sweetness."
US,90.0,42.0,Ballard Canyon,Kaena,"One of Mikael Sigouin's single-vineyard studies, this shows sandalwood, rose petals and juicy berries on the nose. It's ripe yet restrained on the palate, with plump red berries that pull back before being too juicy, with licorice spice and plum skin bitterness on the edges."
US,89.0,75.0,Chehalem Mountains,Roco,"This bottling is sourced from the Wit' End estate vineyard. The palate boasts broad cherry flavors, showing medium concentration and definiton. It's clean, clear and one-dimensional."
Italy,92.0,65.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenute Silvio Nardi,"Broad spice and almond notes evident on the nose of this hearty Brunello are accented by cherry, bright blueberry and cassis. In the mouth, the wine shows enormous elegance and a silky, streamlined feel."
US,88.0,60.0,Alexander Valley,Hawkes,"Very young now and a bit rude, with upfront primary fruit flavors of cherries, black raspberries and new oak. Needs time for all the parts to knit together. Cellar through 2009, at least, and should hold for a while afterward."
US,86.0,25.0,Alexander Valley,Rock Wall,"Blended from two-thirds Zinfandel and one-third Sangiovese, this red is rustic in smoky fruit, soft tannin, raisiny-plum compote and black olive. Moderate in acidity, it presents as fairly light bodied."
France,94.0,40.0,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,"A wonderfully subtle touch of chamomile and yarrow appears first. This is followed by tart apple and citrus notes that also play vividly on the palate. The body is dry and slender, translucent and herbal. There is wonderful energy and drive despite the lightness. The depth of flavor, with that herbal tang, remains beguiling from the start to the long, long finish."
Argentina,84.0,13.0,Mendoza,Ombu,"Leafy raspberry aromas are offset by cured-meat notes of sausage or ballpark hot dogs. This has a creamy yet flabby mouthfeel with barely detectable acidity. Baked cherry and raspberry flavors show touches of cinnamon and chocolate, while the finish is dull."
France,85.0,7.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Kirkland Signature,"A solid wine at a rock-bottom price, this CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages was put together by the well-known nÃ©gociant Patrick LeSec. The full-bodied, amply textured wine delivers bright and cheery cherry and cinnamon flavors with a hint of chocolate. Only a slightly sharp, acidic tang kept the score from rising higher."
Spain,88.0,25.0,Rioja,Bodegas Muriel,"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth."
US,91.0,50.0,Chehalem Mountains,Purple Hands,"Purple plums and tangy pie cherries are the fruit focus, in a well-balanced wine that pushes through with precise, acid-backed cut and drive. This leans to the elegant side in terms of style, with excellent balance and proportion."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Salento,Masseria Altemura,"This savory red features aromas and flavors of violet, juicy blueberry, blackberry, plum and a whiff of cake spice. Firm but fine-grained tannins give support. While it's full-bodied, it's also easy to drink. A licorice note signals the close."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Barbera d'Alba,Villadoria,"This opens with restrained aromas of vanilla, berry and a floral note. The informal, easy-drinking palate offers tart cherry, raspberry and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity. It's not very intense and already extremely accessible so drink soon."
France,89.0,39.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Lavau,"Rich and warm, this is a big, ripe wine. Toasted marshmallow notes frame honeyed pineapple, while hints of singed fruit and mocha linger on the finish. Drink now."
Argentina,85.0,12.0,Salta,Amalaya,Oily aromas of citrus peel and lychee set up a lemony palate with pyrazine-influenced citrus flavors. Lychee is the lead flavor on a finish that's mildly bitter.
Italy,90.0,52.0,Barbaresco,Elvio Cogno,"This fragrant red opens with violet, red berry, crushed herb and menthol scents. It's bright and elegant, offering raspberry, juicy Marasca cherry, white pepper and clove flavors alongside polished tannins. A saline note signals the close."
France,86.0,13.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Malbat,Spice and some firm tannins mark this wine. It has a red-fruit character as well as a more earthy backdrop. With its structure it will need to sit until 2017.
Australia,88.0,20.0,Western Australia,Plantagenet,This supple medium-bodied Pinot Noir is ready to drink. Predominantly earthy notes of leather and dried spices are harmonious and complex without being overly demanding.
France,91.0,48.0,Alsace,AndrÃ© Kientzler,"An earthy hint on the nose cloaks ripe and charming red-apple fruit. The palate comes across as more diffuse but has ample freshness. The body is powerful but dry, characterized by the texture of apple peel. The lemon freshness on the dry finish is lasting."
US,80.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,Eric Ross,"Deeply colored and pretty full-bodied, this RhÃ´ne blend has off-flavors that are medicinal and vegetative. It's just barely drinkable."
France,93.0,42.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau Le Boscq,"This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense. Its weight, ripeness and the potential of the black-currant fruit will all allow it to age. Drink from 2022."
US,87.0,9.0,California,Oak Grove,"This well-oaked, smoky wine is a great value. It has abundant baking spice aromas, as well as rich flavors of ripe pear, nutmeg and vanilla. Ample acidity and delicate tannins help maintain balance."
Argentina,93.0,65.0,Mendoza,Bodega Renacer,"Lush, classy aromas of balsam wood shavings, coconut, vanilla and dark-berry fruits open this hefty Malbec that spent two years in oak prior to bottling. A ripe thick palate maintains full-bodied balance, while this tastes dark, toasty and like a mix of chocolate, coffee and spiced blackberry. Peppery spice notes offset by mocha flavors are prominent on a saturated finish. Drink through 2022."
US,92.0,26.0,Willamette Valley,St. Innocent,"A slightly high-toned scent of lemon candy, pineapple and peach opens the door to this delicious Dijon clone Chardonnay. Aged 11 months in neutral French oak, it's lively and concentrated, with a finishing lick of butterscotch."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa County,Oberon,"This lightly crafted, affordable red blends in smaller percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. It works as a soft, approachable and rounded experience of moderately tannic black cherry and cola, with a streak of black pepper, graphite and cedar mixed within."
US,91.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mullan Road,"This wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (57%) and Merlot (34%) along with dashes of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. A blend of Royal Slope and Seven Hills Vineyard fruit, it opens with aromas of black cherry, cigar box, green herbs, dried mint and potpourri. The herb and dark-fruit flavors are ripe and expressive, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen."
US,92.0,42.0,Mendocino Ridge,Donkey & Goat,"This dazzling, dry and restrained wine was matured in new French oak but with such a light touch that it feels more lean than fat in texture. It has enough fruitiness?crisp apple and lemon flavors?and spice to make it tempting now, though it will improve with age. Best after 2020."
France,92.0,90.0,Hermitage,E. Guigal,"This is the current release from Guigal, which makes it one of the few Hermitages on store shelves that's ready to drink. It's medium to full in weight, chunky and assertive, but not overly concentrated or tannic. Instead, it delivers beefy notes of coffee, black olive and spice, backed by hints of raspberries and cedar."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Sicilia,Morgante,Here's a straightforward and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers delicious blackberry and black cherry flavors that are accented by a hint of Mediterranean herbs. The ripe palate is brightened by just enough fresh acidity.
France,88.0,17.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Haut-Monplaisir,"This wine, with its black fruits and still-firm tannins, is crisp with intense acidity as well as black-currant fruitiness. Its ripe structure suggests the ability to age a little longer, and the wine will be best from 2018."
US,85.0,23.0,Monterey,Wrath,"Nicely dry and crisply acidic, with a minerally scour of stone that cleans the mouth and gets the tastebuds watering. The flavors are of cool-climate lemons, lime and grapefruits. But shows a considerable note of green, feline spray that lowers the score."
France,87.0,27.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"This is a lighter style of Pinot Noir than some produced in Sancerre today. It brings out perfumes and red-cherry flavors lifted by acidity. The wine is fruity, with hints of wood aging and a juicy aftertaste. Drink now."
Italy,83.0,12.0,Chianti,Fattoria il Palagio,"Diluted and ultrasimple, this delivers weak sensations of cooked black-skinned fruit. It's already tired and has an extremely short finish."
Argentina,90.0,23.0,Tupungato,Finca Lalande,"Ripe aromas of dark berries blended with licorice and hard spices are attractive. In the mouth, this is round and blocky, with a friendly disposition. Flavors of blackberry, baked plum and black currant finish with licorice, chocolate, oak, mint and pepper notes. Overall, this is a fine Malbec to drink through 2016."
Italy,84.0,20.0,Prosecco,Cavazza,"Here's an extremely simple sparkler with a shy nose and flavors suggesting acacia, apple and a hint of green melon. Brisk acidity provides the backdrop."
US,90.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Volker Eisele Family Estate,"Made from equal thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, varieties the are co-fermented and then aged in French oak for 22 months, 60% of the oak new, this is a dusty, leathery and earthy wine. Lightly styled, it shares a deep expression of blackberry, dark chocolate and coffee."
France,88.0,30.0,Morgon,Marcel Lapierre,"From biodynamic producer Marcel Lapierre, this is probably as good as it got in 2007. It's a rich wine, concentrated, although the crisp fruits of the year tend to dominate. There are raspberry flavors, very pure, very fresh, but with some good depth of flavor."
France,86.0,35.0,Alsace,Zusslin,"Very textured wine, hinting at fruit that is only just ripe. This light and fragrant wine has red currant fruits and a smoky character. Probably not for aging."
US,92.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Ruby Hill Winery,"An unusually vivid gold color is the first indication that this medium-bodied wine will turn up the dials on flavor. Aromas resemble wood smoke, nutmeg, sandalwood and vanilla, while flavors are subtly fruity but largely oaky in the form of marzipan, toasted bread and other savory nuances. It is gorgeous in a voluptuous way."
US,89.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Treveri Cellars,"Aromas of pear, brioche and citrus peel are forward. The palate brings lively citrus and spice flavors that linger."
US,85.0,26.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Stemilt Creek,"The oak is at the fore on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and baking spices in front of cherry and green pepper. The aromas give a sense of some oxygen exposure."
France,87.0,20.0,Corse,Union de Vignerons de l'Ãle de BeautÃ©,"This attractive and fruity wine blends Niellucciu with Sciacerellu, both local Corsican grapes. The freshness is right there, crisp and hinting at red currant flavors and bright acidity. Drink now."
Italy,83.0,81.0,Barolo,Ca'RomÃ¨,"The wine shows many of the characteristics of the vintage; slightly overripe and plummy, not much definition and plenty of alcohol. On the palate, there is plenty of raisiny fruit is at the front of the palate, but little else and the wine is hot and a little unbalanced, and there is slight bubblegum aftertaste."
US,92.0,38.0,Napa Valley,C. Beck,"An inky black 100% Petite Sirah that's smoky and soft, luxurious in nuanced and complex layers of black and blueberry fruit, black pepper and wild game. An incredible offering from the Napa Valley."
US,87.0,75.0,Russian River Valley,Merriam,"Forest pine and sap are further accentuated by this wine's grip of smoky oak, partially offset by the ripeness of full-bodied baked cherry pie at its heart."
Italy,89.0,55.0,Barolo,Ceretto,"This luminous red offers aromas of wild red berry, dark spice, menthol and a whiff of espresso. The ripe, rather straightforward palate offers raspberry, tart cherry, licorice, toast, mocha and tobacco alongside polished tannins. Drink 2017??022."
Australia,88.0,16.0,South Australia,Mr. Riggs,"A well-structured steak wine, this Shiaz wraps chocolate, lush berry and meaty aromas and flavors into a full body, with chewy tannins and a savory, juicy finish."
US,87.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Fox Run,"Intense notes of crushed stone and slate permeate this stately off-dry Riesling. Pert lemon and tangerine flavors are zippy and fresh, but the wine is more a showcase for its brisk, stony style."
US,86.0,38.0,Sierra Foothills,Tanner,"This medium-bodied wine is very floral for a red. It smells like roses and raspberries, tastes exuberantly fruity and has a juicy, lightly tannic texture."
US,92.0,22.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"Once again, here is a Seven Hills wine that opens with truly lovely aromatics. It's a clean varietal expression of Syrah, with medium weight, wild berries and finishing highlights of pepper, earth, sea salt, baking spices and cassis."
US,90.0,22.0,Yakima Valley,Efeste,"This rosÃ© is a field blend of MourvÃ¨dre and Grenache. A very pretty pale-peach color, the aromas bring pleasing notes of herb, spice, strawberry, passion fruit and mineral. The flavors are dry and full in feel, showing weight and intensity but still a sense of lightness."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Rioja,Baron De Ley,"This is a warm, weighty Tempranillo with earthy, leathery, baked berry aromas. The palate is plump but solid and structured, with ripe, mildly salty tasting berry flavors that finish mossy and mature, with an abundance of oak-based vanilla and earth notes."
US,88.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Archium,"This 100% Grenache pink wine kicks off with a fairly light nose that shyly presents steely aromas of lemon wedge. There is a firm structure to the sip, where pink grapefruit and other citrus elements ride a chalky structure. Texture is key here."
US,93.0,80.0,St. Helena,Sleeping Giant,"This is a lovely, well-crafted wine from a fine site in the heart of the appellation, originally planted by Jim Barbour. It opens with richly inviting vanilla cream and clarified butter notes before soft tannin and subtle oak come into play. The fruit is lively, with strawberry and cherry flavors."
Italy,89.0,22.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Arduini,"This structured ripasso has intense aromas of prune, raisin and graphite. The round and velvety palate offers a ripe blackberry core, spiced by accents of chocolate, mint, tobacco and bitter almond. Pair this with seasoned cheeses or spicy red-meat dishes."
Italy,89.0,18.0,Soave,Fattori,"This aged expression of Motto Piane Soave drinks with such intensity, thickness and golden brilliance, you'd almost mistake it for a dessert wine. Aromas include candied fruit and sweet pineapple."
US,93.0,64.0,Carneros,Ram's Gate,"From a marquee grand-cru-like site famous for the variety, this version enhances its reputation, offering a twist of green martini olive, zesty lemon rind and wild anise. Lingering in freshness, the acidity is remarkable and memorable, supporting a full-bodied concentration of great flavor."
Spain,87.0,13.0,Rueda,Palacio de Bornos,"The nose on this regularly solid Verdejo is mild, with aromas of apple, pear and melon. The palate is round and a touch fleshy, with modest acidity pushing pithy peach and pear flavors. The finish tastes of almond skins and apple."
US,87.0,38.0,Central Coast,Seven Angels,"This nose of this wine shy at first, before blackberry paste, hibiscus and cola aromas arise. It's medium-bodied on the palate, with bright blueberry, marjoram and black pepper flavors, bound together by prominent acidity."
US,87.0,22.0,Paso Robles,Still Waters,"This is a very dry, soft Merlot. At the age of four years, it's fully resolved and ready to drink now. Shows polished cherry, currant, spice and cedar flavors, finished with a bite of acidity."
US,91.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"Spicy and showing some sweetness around the edges, presumably from a bit of residual sugar. Lovely fruit is the highlight here, textural and luscious with flavors of pears and apricots. Vivid acidity cuts through the fleshy core."
US,88.0,20.0,Sonoma Valley,Deerfield Ranch,"Briny and dark copper-orange in color, this is a weighty wine, though the alcohol level is low. The tannins and leathery texture of the Syrah shine through, checked by tangy citrus and a hit of white pepper."
US,88.0,40.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Dobbes Family Estate,"Juicy and bright, this pushes snappy raspberry and cherry fruit front and center, with a tasty touch of spice as well. It's a good introduction to the more elegant style of the 2013 vintage wines."
US,92.0,29.0,Chehalem Mountains,Chehalem,"The slightly off-dry profile (12g/L residual sugar) perfectly complements the ultraripe, deeply concentrated fruit. It's downright plush, with ripe apple and pear tart flavors. Young as it is, you may not want to wait to drink this one."
US,91.0,22.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"Equal parts SÃ©millon and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine offers aromas of kiwi, spice and citrus that provide nuance and appeal. It's textured and full in feel, stretching out on the finish."
Italy,84.0,16.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Giacosa Fratelli,"The nose on this burly red is disappointingly mute. Nonetheless, the palate shows intriguing flavors of earth and fall leaves that linger on the finish. Mouth-coating tannins will benefit from another year or two in bottle."
France,82.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de l'Aubrade,This is a tight woody wine that is hard and over-extracted. Some fruit may come through but it is hard to imagine.
Australia,87.0,36.0,Yarra Valley,Punt Road,"Herbal and stemmy (100% whole-bunch fermented), this is a bit of an outlier in the world of Australian Pinot Noir. It's light to medium in weight, with gentle tannins and tart cherry fruit. Oak takes the form of mocha on the finish. My initial impression was ?simple but appealing,??but upon reflection perhaps it just needs more time to show its stuff."
US,93.0,48.0,Anderson Valley,Baxter,"This shows a combination of deep fruit flavors and a firm, tight-grained texture that make it classic in style. Black cherry and black currant flavors are wonderfully accented by impressions of pine forest and dried mushrooms. Baxter matured this wine in 100% neutral French oak barrels, so the taste is all about the Langley grapes and not new oak."
US,89.0,20.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Poiema,"Buttery warmth shows on the nose of this wine by vintner Travis Proctor, alongside poached pear fruit and an iodine edge. Featuring original artwork by James Caprell on the label, the wine offers pan-seared golden apples, tart pear skin and more of the iodine edge once sipped."
US,86.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Domaine Pouillon,"A menthol/eucalyptus note shoots through the aroma of this pleasant Cabernet. It shows quickly maturing flavors of plum and pie cherry, an easy-drinking softness throughout the mid-palate, and just a hint of heat in the finish."
Australia,94.0,95.0,McLaren Vale,Angove,"Selected from four sites planted 40??0 years ago, this is a full-bodied, muscular, rich Shiraz. Roast beef notes provide savory counterpoints to ripe plum, chocolate and mint. Long, firm and focused on the finish, where it picks up some mocha nuances. Drink now??030."
US,86.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Graziano,"Herbaceous in flavor and firm in texture, it brings a freshness and tang with plenty of acidity to perk up fish, shellfish or chicken like a squeeze of fresh lemon."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Highland Cellars,This easygoing off-dry Riesling boasts pretty orange blossom and white-peach perfume. Crisp stone-fruit flavors on the palate are accented by honey and bee pollen. The finish is long and zesty.
Italy,87.0,15.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,La Calonica,"Aromas of ripe blackberry, toasted oak and a whiff of roasted coffee bean lead the nose and carry over to the palate of this forward wine. It's already extremely accessible so enjoy soon."
US,86.0,40.0,Paicines,Donati,"Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy."
France,91.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,Domaine Houchart,"This rich wine comes from the sheltered vineyards close to Mount Sainte-Victoire. The weight of the ripe fruit gives a full-bodied style with both acidity and a spicy, peppery character. This is a wine to hold for a few months and drink from late 2017."
Italy,90.0,34.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Manara,"This is a recommended wine for those who love classic expressions of Amarone. The wine's intensity is fueled by aromas of cherry, apple, spice and chocolate and it really comes alive in the mouth thanks to a long, fresh trail of cola and dried herbs."
US,86.0,42.0,Sonoma County,D'Argenzio,"Unusual for a 2003 Cab to be held back this long before release. Maybe they thought the tannins were too strong. They're fully resolved now, but the fruit has faded, leaving behind mild flavors of dried cherries, currants and herbs that finish very dry. It's an elegant wine, rather than a voluptuous one."
France,92.0,30.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,A very vivid impression of tart red currant on the nose soon attains a creamy edge. The palate has beautiful purity of fruit: Red currant heightened by vivid citrus freshness. There is something weightless and wonderfully light about this with its really fine mousse?a sophisticated dry apÃ©ritif with a wonderful and long aftertaste of tart red apple.
US,91.0,60.0,Mount Veeder,Hess Collection,"True to its advocacy for Malbec in the Napa Valley, the producer adds 15% Malbec to this Cabernet Sauvignon, forging a dark, rich and intense wine that's generous in black fruit and tobacco. It nonetheless retains ample acidity to stay balanced and rewarding on the palate. Enjoy through 2020."
US,90.0,42.0,Willamette Valley,Sineann,"The barrel aging is still the defining element in this wine, adding layers of meaty fat to what appears to be very young fruit. Bright cranberry and cherry notes are set in firm acids. Well-integrated hints of herb and spice, bursts of sweet berry and dry, tea-flavored tannins sail through the finish."
Australia,91.0,16.0,Barossa,St Hallett,"A terrific example of drink-now pleasure from the Barossa, this Shiraz deftly combines cedar and vanilla notes with dark fruit flavors. It's richly textured, with velvety tannins and crisp acids that frame the long finish. Drink now??020."
US,84.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Thirsty Owl Wine Company,"Curious spice notes accent this savory, apple-scented Riesling. It's dry in style, with flavors of pressed apples and pears that are brightened by a shower of lemon and lime."
Italy,91.0,26.0,Collio,Schiopetto,"Green apple, Bartlett pear and citrus aromas follow through to the bright, creamy palate, along with a stony mineral note. An elegant, balanced wine with a fresh, lingering finish."
France,90.0,54.0,Meursault,Roux PÃ¨re et Fils,"Slow to show its quality, with a little aeration this becomes a superripe wine, its wood element dominated by the intense tropical fruits. There is some balancing restraint in the citrus character, along with the acidity. Enjoy now."
US,88.0,41.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cooper-Garrod,"This blend of 64% Syrah and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon is starting to show its age, with light prune, dried cherry-tobacco and clove aromas. Dried strawberry, star anise and baking spice arise on the palate, which is full of flavor but should be enjoyed soon."
US,84.0,30.0,Virginia,Tarara,"If a buttery, oaky, roasty, toasty Viognier is what you seek, Virginia's Tarara Vineyards has it. Toasted oak, buttered popcorn and fresh apples dominate both the nose and palate of this dry, full-bodied wine. It's a straightforward wine with fairly high alcohol, but balanced with a vibrant acidity."
France,94.0,85.0,Beaune,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"A complete wine that speaks of both richness and terroir. While the tannins are certainly there, they are dominated by rich black fruits, ripeness, power and concentration. It is the sort of wine that reveals many layers of flavor and complexity. Age for five years."
Spain,88.0,18.0,Cava,Valdelavia,"Aromas of yeasty pastry, powdered sugar and apple pie come prior to a nervy palate with a mix of tropical melon and papaya flavors along with salad-like garden notes. Flavors of green herbs are prominent on the finish."
US,93.0,28.0,Anderson Valley,Roederer Estate,"Gorgeous foam leads this wine, a blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay. Golden peach in color with a dry, savory strawberry richness and smooth texture, it is buoyed by solid acidity. Estate-grown, this is a stellar California sparkler, incredibly well-priced and versatile."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Rioja,Bodegas Muriel,"Solid up front, with sweet and spicy aromas of plum, vanilla and candied berry. Feels full and good, with weight and thickness boosting up toasty, woody berry flavors. Dries out on the finish, leaving spice and a resiny taste. Drink now through 2014."
France,92.0,25.0,Vouvray,Domaine Vincent CarÃªme,"White peach aromas and powerful fruitiness give this wine great intensity. It is bone dry while rich, full of quince, pear and peach fruits. There is an extra richness from the edge of wood aging. The wine is still young and should not be drunk before 2020."
US,84.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mazzocco,"With alcohol at an astounding 16.5%, this Zin tastes hot and peppery. Some high alcohol wines have a fat sweetness that makes them delicious. This one's bone dry, with dried blackberry and cherry flavors that finish with a burn."
US,94.0,80.0,Dundee Hills,The Eyrie Vineyards,"Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond."
France,87.0,14.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Roc Meynard,"The dry tannins are firmly in charge in this young wine, its fruit fresh rather than rich. The flavors are red plum juice, acidity and a dry core that needs another year to soften."
Argentina,85.0,10.0,Tupungato,Andeluna,"Warm and solid, with weight and color. The palate is well rounded and full, with sweet, semisticky berry flavors and a lashing of oak. The finish turns a little herbal and earthy, while the lasting flavors are of vanilla and wood resin."
US,87.0,30.0,Temecula Valley,Callaway,"This seems like a warm-climate bottling, showing lots of tar, beef char and deep black fruit on the nose. The palate is thick with sticky tannins, though the overall mouthfeel is soft. Flavors of blackberries and roast beef ensue."
France,88.0,34.0,Alsace,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler,"Earth and apple notes unite to make this juicy, fresh and sprightly Riesling. The style is dry, helped by a slight phenolic grip and that characteristic, lime-lemon acidity that brightens everything."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Cava,Paul Cheneau,"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty."
US,90.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Fontanella,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness. This Chablis-style wine is marked by minerals and suggestions of lemons and limes, as well as strong acidity. Calls for fresh crab in the shell, with plenty of drawn butter for dipping."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Poggio Alloro,"Floral scents of white and yellow field flowers meld together with aromas of ripe orchard fruit. The juicy palate doles out ripe yellow apple, creamy pear, candied lemon drop and a savory hint of saline. A light mineral note lifts the finish."
France,91.0,67.0,Puisseguin Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau BeausÃ©jour,"Produced from a selection of 80-year-old vines, this is a dense, smooth wine. It has a dry core although this is surrounded by such rich fruit and spice. The wine is now almost mature, ripe and full with a great shot of final acidity."
Spain,84.0,10.0,La Mancha,Marques de Toledo,"This wine's neutral nose includes mild citrus scents. It's tired and bland on the palate, with yeasty flavors, finishing with papaya and commercial white bread notes."
US,87.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),4 Cellars,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec offers vanilla, herb and cherry aromas that seem a bit coarse. The palate is full of baking spice flavors?notably vanilla. It's heavy on the oak notes, despite having aged in just 42% new French barrels, the rest older French and American."
US,88.0,55.0,Carneros,Frank Family,"Honeycomb and a fruit basket of melon and berry ride a wave of medium acidity and mellowed sweetness, with a touch of green apple. This is a good call for morning Mimosas."
US,89.0,40.0,Dundee Hills,Erath,"This is a thin, hard and tight version of the estate wine. It shows a bit more depth, but it's compact and slow to unravel. The oak is delivering butterscotch and vanilla, laid on as a buttery finish. This is too young to drink right now."
US,87.0,10.0,California,Save Me San Francisco,"This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture."
France,93.0,260.0,Clos de Vougeot,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020."
US,83.0,16.0,Napa Valley,Ca' Momi,"Sharp in acidity and jellied, with sweet black cherry, cola and oak flavors."
US,95.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Falcone,"There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins."
US,87.0,19.0,Monterey,Talbott,"A rich, oaky Chardonnay, overwhelming in buttered toast, caramel, pineapple jam, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and cinnamon spice flavors. If you're looking for a big, strong Chardonnnay, it's for you."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Barolo,Piazzo Armando,"The 2008 vintage was not an easy one but Piazzo Armando has crafted an elegant and streamlined expression of Nebbiolo that is redolent of wild berry, chopped herb and white licorice. It finishes with tight, dusty tannins."
US,91.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Brigadoon,"This delightful wine, principally fermented in neutral oak, and aged sur lie, offers lovely details of apple flesh and skin, white melon, a hint of daikon radish, and the pinpoint persistence that is the mark of superior winemaking. Pinot Blanc can go in various directions in Oregon, but this bright and acidic wine really shows the way to a style that is at once drinkable, complex and food friendly."
US,86.0,16.0,Napa Valley,Jax,"Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this fun, approachable wine is ready for the beach or picnic grounds. Round and easygoing on the palate, it shows tart apple, lime and lemongrass flavors."
Italy,89.0,50.0,Barolo,Negretti,"This opens with enticing scents of rose, iris and perfumed berry. The firmly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, white pepper, licorice and clove alongside drying, austere tannins that leave a rather grainy finish."
Italy,87.0,10.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Talamonti,"Soft, supple and seductive, ModÃ  is a simple wine that is propped up by notes of mature cherry fruit, spice and tobacco. It's easy in the mouth, with a rich, velvety texture."
US,89.0,33.0,Carneros,Roche,"This is a richly oaked young Chardonnay. It brims with ripe papaya, mango, pineapple and apple flavors, while the oak barrels add layers of buttered toast, honey and vanilla meringue."
US,87.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,Brian Carter Cellars,"This wine is a unique blend of Viognier (53%), Roussanne (35%) and Riesling. It's aromatic, with notes of flowers, green gummy bear and pear. It drinks dry with floral and grapey flavors, with it all not seeming to entirely meld."
Spain,85.0,10.0,Rioja,Burgo Viejo,"Raspberry aromas are simple but friendly. This feels condensed and a bit jammy, without a lot of stand-up structure. Candied, lightly loamy flavors of plum and currant finish modest and short."
US,90.0,20.0,California,Kunde,"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines."
US,88.0,75.0,Sonoma Valley,Hanzell,"Tastes rich and flashy now, with a rich array of oranges, pineapples and peaches, accented with oak. The acidity is just fine. Hanzell Chardonnays have a history of aging, so try stashing it for six years and see what happens."
France,91.0,70.0,Lalande de Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau le Manoir,"Despite the high alcohol level, this is classic Bordeaux, with style, elegance and fine balance between tannin and ripe black-currant fruit. It demonstrates the concentration and rich structure of the vintage, yet the finish has a light, bright, fruity touch."
Argentina,83.0,8.0,San Juan,Arge & Tina,"Sweet melon and apple aromas fall off to cheesy. The palate has some jump in it, but the flavors are generic and sweet, suggesting mealy citrus and banana. A rudimentary wine with a gimmicky name."
US,92.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"Great structure marks this lush, young Pinot Noir. Crisp acidity and refined, firm tannins give it a solid framework, and the flavors are delicious. Shows pie-filling cherries, black raspberries, currants and mocha, with spicy cinnamon and anise. Will age for up to a decade."
US,88.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Rally Point Wines,"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Barbera d'Alba Superiore,Brezza,"Mouthwatering aromas of dark berry, cooking spice and cured meat lead the nose on this bold wine. The savory palate doles out layers of mature black cherry, blackberry, ground black pepper and savory herb alongside firm acidity and velvety tannins. Drink through 2021."
US,87.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sagelands,"Light in color, this blend of 51% Syrah, 42% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon is perfumed with orange peel, coffee, plum and herbs. It drinks off dry, quite light and elegant in style with grainy tannins."
US,93.0,28.0,Dry Creek Valley,Gustafson Family,"This is a pretty wine, vibrant in white pepper and braised meat. The nose is pure violet and blueberry, while the approach to the fruit is light-handed, with integrated tannins and a low oak imprint. Entirely varietal, it delves into earthy territory with elements of forest floor and dark chocolate."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Monte del FrÃ ,"Cedar, ground pepper, cassis, scorched earth and tobacco aromas lead the way on this powerfully structured red. The chewy full-bodied palate doles out dried black cherry, black currant, fig, licorice and dark bitter chocolate set against a backbone of ripe and solid tannins."
Italy,88.0,65.0,Franciacorta,Fratelli Muratori,"There's a caramel candy or custard-like quality to this wine that is backed by pear, apricot and mature fruit. It's a complex, layered sparkler with creamy vanilla mousse and golden saturation."
Italy,91.0,30.0,Isola dei Nuraghi,Pala,"Made with old vines, this soulful red opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, game, baked earth, wild herb and a smoky note. The ripe, round palate doles out ripe black plum, black cherry, grilled rosemary and wild fennel alongside solid, velvety tannins. Concentrated and accessible, it will offer several more years of sheer drinking pleasure. Drink through 2021."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Roero,Malabaila,"Pear, apricot and honeysuckle scents lead carry over to the soft, round palate along with a hint of pear. A white almond note fills in the finish."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gamache,"Rich cherry fruit anchors this excellent, estate-grown Merlot. It's lush and textural, with deep, dark fruit flavors and pleasant roasted notes of coffee and smoke. Half the barrels were new American oak, the rest French, mostly new."
US,87.0,39.0,Dry Creek Valley,Stephen & Walker,"This is a robust, ripe and fruity Zinfandel that impresses for the sheer exuberance of its flavors. They range from black cherries and red currants to cola, chocolate, black pepper and the sweet, glyceriney taste of high alcohol."
Italy,94.0,68.0,Barolo,Palladino,"Full-bodied and delicious, this opens with aromas of red berry, rose, underbrush, kitchen spice and a balsamic note. The structured palate doles out juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, white pepper, grilled herb, vanilla and mineral alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It already has nice depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2019??031."
Italy,84.0,12.0,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,Terra Serena,"Here's a simple, no-fuss Prosecco Extra Dry with an interesting herbal component that recalls dried oregano or hay. There's peach and citrus fruit at the back that is carried forward by spicy effervescence. The mouthfeel is thin and tonic."
US,85.0,15.0,San Lucas,Lockwood,"Dust, black cherries and a hint of tarragon arise on the nose of this wine from a small appellation in Monterey County. Char and turned black soil power the very dark palate, which also shows a bit of sagebrush and prominent tannins."
Argentina,88.0,40.0,Mendoza,FranÃ§ois Lurton,"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors. Finishes firm, tight and a bit clipped and choppy. A reflection of 2008's tough conditions."
US,88.0,28.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"This barrel-fermented wine reflects the modest ripeness that marked the 2010 vintage. Scents of almond paste, orange peel, citrus, melon and pear intertwine, and the wine's flavors carry light suggestions of them all, along with a touch of caramel. It's drinking well right now, so why wait?"
US,91.0,36.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Diatom,"Subtle and somewhat sweet aromas of honey, candied pecan, fresh-sliced honeydew and lemon balm show on the nose of this bottling by Greg Brewer from a brand new vineyard. The palate is clean and fresh, and the sip offers a great tactile sensation on the tongue, with grippy tannins revealing citrus and melon flavors."
US,86.0,24.0,Monticello,Lovingston,"Fruity aromas of blueberry pie, raspberry and Cran-Grape Juice are palpable. Flavors in the same vein are jammy and spicy. Mouthwatering acidity manifests itself in this full-bodied fruit bomb."
France,92.0,40.0,Chablis,Domaine CheneviÃ¨res,"Full of fruit, this also expresses a tight and mineral sense of terroir. Tangy, packed with white fruit and green plums cut with lime juice, this ripe, full-bodied wine is going to be delicious. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bunchgrass,"A blend of Cabernet Franc (60%) and Merlot, this wine offers high-toned aromas of dried herbs, milk chocolate and cherry, along with an undertone of green pepper. The chocolate and cherry flavors are silky and linger long after the last sip."
US,89.0,25.0,Lodi,Mettler Family Vineyards,"The color is deep, the aromas thick with wood smoke, bacon and dried plums, and the flavors are ripe, like blackberry syrup but dry. This is full bodied and very firm in texture due to mouth-coating tannins that are nearly matched on the finish by persistent and bold fruit flavors. Tasty now, it should age nicely through 2020."
US,87.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,"Light aromas of lemon, apple, pineapple, toast and spice lead to just off-dry flavors. It drinks a little sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment?a straightforward crowd pleaser."
France,84.0,30.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau des Tourtes,"From a 17-acre Merlot-dominated vineyard, this is a dry wine, where the tannins dominate the fruit. The wine has a bitter edge from too much extraction. The hints of fruit are not quite enough."
Australia,87.0,13.0,Hunter Valley,Heritage Road,"Round and ripe tropical fruit mark this solid and affordable Chardonnay. Interesting shadings of lime, clove and other spices keep it engaging on the palate. Ends with a medium- length finish of sweet-tart pineapple fruit."
US,90.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ryan Patrick,"Sourced from Sagemoor Farms and the Homestead estate vineyard, this detailed and complex wine opens with pear and pineapple scents and flavors, then layers in pretty spices and toasty highlights."
France,93.0,85.0,Cahors,Mas del PÃ©riÃ©,"The top cuvÃ©e from Mas del PÃ©riÃ©, this is a concentrated wine, with new wood and black fruit notes. It's packed with intense tannins, spice from the wood aging and a great depth of flavor. This is an impressive wine that will need to age for at least 5?? years."
US,95.0,150.0,Oakville,B Cellars,"Sanguine, dense and thick, this offers an intriguing nose of black pepper and garrigue that conveys a sense of adventure and romance. Its leathery texture never becomes overly weighty, though the fruit and oak are plenty generous. An ideal partner for an equally beautiful steak, its structure suggests time in the cellar will only add to the experience; drink through 2022."
US,93.0,48.0,Adelaida District,Paix Sur Terre,"Lilac and violet hang with blackberries, black plums and sweet mocha on this purple chiffon-cake scented wine  from winemaker Ryan Pease. The blend of 55% Grenache, 30% MourvÃ¨dre, 12% Syrah and and 3% Counoise is full and silky on the palate, with olallieberry fruits, proving juicy but not jammy or overpowering."
France,95.0,50.0,Alsace,Biecher & Schaal,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017??035."
US,91.0,15.0,Clarksburg,Dry Creek Vineyard,"Orange-marmalade aromas set the stage for a rather full-bodied, dry and flavorful wine. Floral and fruity elements are counter-balanced by a tangy texture and subtle mineral accents. A classic of the type, it has a lot of personality, a great presence on the palate and a lingering finish."
Australia,92.0,23.0,Barossa,Thorn Clarke,"Savvy shoppers may be able to find this for about $20, making it an excellent deal in a full-bodied, structured red wine. Cassis, vanilla and plum notes mark the nose and palate, finishing with a flourish of dusty-textured tannins. Drink now??025."
France,88.0,28.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,ChÃ¢teau de FuissÃ©,"From vines in the northern part of the appellation, this ripe wine conveys peaches and apricots laced with lime. A vibrant, mineral wine with swathes of fresh acidity, it can be drunk now."
US,86.0,16.0,California,Old Soul,"This soft and lightly spicy wine has big fruit flavors, a veneer of sweet oak and a plush texture. It's easy to smell and taste the ripe cherry and strawberry accents."
US,93.0,60.0,Mount Veeder,Hess Collection,"With 20% Malbec, this wine is layered in refined complexity, swaying from juicy blueberry to herbaceous cherry and currant. Restrained in oak, with the slightest notion of vanilla on the palate, it finishes in mouthwatering dark chocolate?the tannins firm and structured."
US,84.0,20.0,Rogue Valley,Del Rio,"This smells??and remarkably it also tastes?like bubble gum, with some pineapple tossed in for good measure. Peaches and apricots? Not so much; this is definitely an atypical Viognier, but brings plenty of candied fruit to the table."
France,85.0,35.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau de Janicon,"This is a lightly creamy, fruity wine. With touches of citrus, bitter orange and a good burst of acidity, it is balanced, ripe and ready to drink."
Italy,84.0,9.0,Valpolicella,Bolla,"Seems confected, with sweet Jolly Rancher aromas playing against taut acidity. A light, tart offering best paired with tomato-based sauces?fine with spaghetti at your local Italian joint."
US,91.0,18.0,Lake County,Hess Collection,"Good ripeness and a sophisticated, complex character make this full-bodied wine interesting to drink. It has classic characteristics like bell pepper and black olive aromas, along with classy blackcurrant and light spicy, oaky notes. Drink now through 2020. (Available exclusively at restaurants.)"
Spain,87.0,13.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de Campo Nuble,"Opens with rubber, smoke, leather and coffee aromas, then the fruit comes in on the palate, which is juicy and correct, with tight, fresh red-fruit flavors and notes of ripe tomato and pepper flake. Finishes spicy and dry, with a crispness that'll make it 100% food-friendly."
US,88.0,14.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"They packed a little Cabernet Franc and Merlot into this Sangiovese to give it richness, with rewarding results. It's quite a good wine, dry and tart in mouthwatering acidity, with solid tannins framing accessible flavors of cherries, cola, leather and cedar. A commendable effort at a fair price."
US,88.0,40.0,Sonoma County,Dutcher Crossing,"A fine Cabernet, dry and balanced. It's rich in blackberries, anise and currants, with an herbaceousness that grounds it. Food-friendly, and totally drinkable now."
France,91.0,50.0,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey,"The appetizing perfume is a perfect fusion of lemon zest and tart apple. The palate also pitches that same, ripe freshness against zingy tang. The palate is dry, textured and juicy and thus very moreish. This is very alive and appetizing with a super-clean, lip-smacking finish."
France,86.0,10.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de l'Aubrade,"Solidly structured, this is a dense wine. Its black fruits add to the density, giving a concentrated, fruity wine. Drink this starting from mid-2018."
Spain,91.0,40.0,Rioja,Bodegas Escudero,"Elegant spicy aromas of dried red fruits and plum are fresh and clean. A pure forward medium-bodied palate holds flavors of spiced cherry, plum and vanilla. Those flavors are repeated and unbroken on a clean lithe finish. Drink through 2022."
France,90.0,60.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Domaine de Nalys,"This contains a higher proportion of Roussanne than Nalys's regular white cuvÃ©e, and more barrel influence as well. Toast accents pineapple, melon and honey flavors, finishing clean and pleasant."
Italy,87.0,55.0,Barolo,Virna Borgogno,"Underbrush, coconut, espresso and floral aromas lead the nose. It's full-bodied but lean in terms of fruit richness, offering exotic spice, roasted coffee bean and a hint of licorice while aggressive grainy tannins leave a mouth-drying astringent finish."
Italy,86.0,100.0,Barolo,Marchesi di Barolo,"Aromas of weedy underbrush, toast, menthol and cherry marinated in spirits emerge in the glass. The palate shows raw sour cherry and a hint of licorice alongside raspy tannins that dry out the finish."
France,88.0,30.0,Bergerac Sec,ChÃ¢teau BeausÃ©jour,"Organically grown fruit, aged in new wood for 12 months, creates this rich smooth wine. With a juicy oxidative character, it is soft and round. Yellow fruits and spice come together in a wine that is now ready to drink."
Spain,87.0,50.0,Cava,JuvÃ© y Camps,"With lemon-lime and lemongrass aromas, this Cava is slightly exotic on the bouquet. The palate feels good but not terribly interesting or complex, with flavors of dusty apple, peach and vanilla. With a short finish, this vintage sparkler is fine but not as good as in the past."
US,92.0,24.0,Amador County,Fiddletown Cellars,"Built for the long haul, this full-bodied and very firmly textured wine is impressive to taste now but will drink best after 2023. Beguiling aromas touch on sweet spices, grilled meat, black pepper, blackberries and wood smoke. Concentrated, layered fruit flavors seem to coat the palate and linger on the finish."
US,92.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Amalie Robert,"This barrel-fermented, estate-grown wine matches its luscious citrus and pineapple fruit to veins of butter, caramel and toast. It's perfectly balanced, lively and fresh, even after being open for a full 24 hours. The style, now becoming particular to many Oregon Chardonnays, sits squarely on the fence between the hyper-lushness of California and the minerality of northern Burgundies."
US,85.0,13.0,Coombsville,FlyWine,"Innocuous red fruit and a density of baked plum provide a fruity plushness in this travel-size wine, 100% varietal with ample tannin."
Argentina,86.0,10.0,Mendoza,Tilia,"Generic pear and apple aromas are simple but good. This wine runs light on oak and feels juicy and correct. Flavors of apple, pear and vanilla turn more briny and salty on the finish, which circles back with sweetness as it fades away."
US,93.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Madrigal,"Pricey, yes, but Madrigal pulled out all the stops on this flashy wine, making it their best Cabernet ever. It's a big, tannic and dry wine, stuffed with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Voluptuous and dramatic, but it needs age, possibly a lot. Give it a rest until 2015 and see how it's doing then."
US,86.0,14.0,California,Jamieson Ranch,"$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that shows such ripe, succulent fruit. It's rich in oranges, pineapples, limes and mangoes, brightened with crisp acidity. Entirely unoaked, the finish is dry, pure and clean."
US,87.0,13.0,California,Hey Mambo,"In calling this southern RhÃ´ne-style blend Bistro Style, the winery means to suggest friends gathered in a nice restaurant, having fun and not being fussy about what's in the bottle. That perfectly describes this dry, soft red wine, with its flavors of blackberries, cherries and cocoa."
US,85.0,84.0,Coombsville,Cairdean Estate,"This 76% Cabernet Franc and 24% Malbec blend pushes the coolness of the vintage and the appellation in its extremely herbal, woody nose, a taste of bell pepper rising midway through its lean palate. It finishes round and soft."
Argentina,84.0,9.0,Argentina,San Huberto,"Earthy, rubbery berry aromas are the set up to a full palate with flavors of rubber, roasted berry, saltiness and plum. A spicy, peppery finish with a spot of oak comes with freshness and good overall feel."
France,95.0,353.0,Mazis-Chambertin,Domaine Faiveley,"This wine is concentrated and dense. Big tannins flow up through this wine, giving shape to the ripe black fruit. In the back, acidity dominates bright red berries and the potential for a rich, generous future. The wine will age over many years. Drink from 2022."
Argentina,86.0,12.0,Mendoza,Tercos,"Woodsy, spicy aromas form a solid opening. There's adequate acidity on the palate along with raspberry, red plum and mild herbal notes. Racy, spicy and just toasty enough to rate well across the finish."
France,85.0,19.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Jean-Marc Burgaud,"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now."
Australia,92.0,50.0,Barossa,ChÃ¢teau Tanunda,"This intriguing effort starts off a bit odd, hinting at scents of maple syrup, mint and tomato. Thankfully, it quickly rights itself, morphing into a complex herbal mÃ©lange laced with mocha and plum. There's a sense of restraint to it on the midpalate, but then a surge of vibrancy on the long, velvety finish. Ready to drink."
US,92.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Newton,"Soft, slightly hot and peppery in alcohol, but very dry, this Merlot shows intense flavors of cherry marmalade, blackberry essence, dark chocolate and cedar. It's a rich wine to drink with grilled steak. The tannins will balance out the meaty richness."
Italy,93.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Donatella Cinelli Colombini,"Here is a thick and succulent expression of Brunello di Montalcino with a generous and immediately friendly disposition. The wine is soft, smooth and satisfying with firm tannins and a full delivery of blackberry, cherry and spice."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Bierzo,Armas de Guerra,Light raspberry and plum aromas offer a touch of floral violet. This everyday MencÃ­a shows grip and expansive flavors of earthy plum and raspberry. Moderate oak and a medicinal note rise up on a fresh finish.
US,95.0,105.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Silky on the palate, this offers exotic aromas of orange blossom and spicy cardamom. Juicy in fresh cherry, it combines structured elegance and plenty of power, amid a mouthwatering quality that's seductively delicious and yet just begs the question of how much more nuanced the flavors will be in time. Drink through 2022."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,La Farra,"This vineyard-designate sparkler shows enormous softness and creaminess, with plush aromas of peach, sweet grapefruit and sweet almond flower."
US,90.0,30.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Domaine Coteau,"From the first whiff?laden with tangy notes of herb, leaf and spicy cranberry fruit?this announces itself as classic Oregon Pinot Noir. At 14+% it's ripe enough to build a core of sweet cherry fruit; but it is not shy about expressing the herbal side of the grape, and does so to good effect. It's a vivacious, expressive wine that offers a rich range of flavors, well beyond the basic fruit and barrel approach of too many wineries."
France,87.0,15.0,Marcillac,Domaine Laurens,"Also known as the Mansois, the Fer Servadou has produced a bright and fruity wine from vineyards in the foothills of France's central mountains. It is soft, juicy and with fine acidity that cuts through its red fruits. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Soave,Franchetto,"This savory white opens with aromas of exotic fruit, apricot, hay and a whiff of wild flower that follow through to the palate along with grapefruit and a vegetal note. A mineral accent lifts the finish."
France,88.0,35.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine Carrette,"This structured, mineral wine has a fine tension between tight acidity and zesty acidity that gives it a nervy, crisp character. It is still developing, with its steely structure still dominant; drink from 2017."
France,87.0,48.0,Champagne,Liebart-RÃ©gnier,"This is a soft, fruity style of rosÃ©, perfectly suited as an apÃ©ritif. It has attractive red currant and raspberry fruit, a light touch of tannin and balanced acidity, finishing elegant and crisp."
US,90.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Buehler,"Good price for a Napa Valley Cabernet this distinguished. It's rich and satisfying in blackberry, black currant and blueberry fruit, with a lovely coat of smoky oak. Shows lots of complexity, and the finish is dry and spicy. Could go the distance, but just to be safe, drink over the next six years."
Spain,91.0,30.0,Rioja,Taron,"Foresty blackberry aromas come with a cola note and a dash of char. This feels full and rich, with wall-to-wall tannins. A mix of baked berry fruits and soy sauce flavors finishes with mild leather and lasting savory notes. Drink through 2022."
Spain,91.0,35.0,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,Finca WÃ¶lffer,"This Long Island winery's venture into making overseas wines offers rewards courtesy of this Petit Verdot-led blend from Mallorca. Rubbery, smoky aromas of blackberry and black olive set up a chunky, chewy palate with full ripeness. Flavors of baked blackberry, core spice and chocolate end with warmth but subdued richness. Drink through 2022."
US,92.0,75.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dunham,"Appealing aromas of cedar, vanilla, smoke and cherry are followed by a full creamy-feeling palate loaded with fresh cherry flavors along with abundant barrel accents. It hits a lot of high notes, with a lengthy finish capping it off."
US,91.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Trinchero,"This is a blend of grapes from Mario's Vineyard and Central Park West Vineyard, both in St. Helena. Full bodied and voluptuous, it offers classically tuned touches of cedar, dried herb, lingering red cherry and cassis. Sizable tannins give it plushness and depth. Drink now through 2022."
US,94.0,80.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Den Hoed,"Bright and dense, totally packed with dark fruits and aromas, this young and brambly blend brings tart, wild berry, cassis and smoky espresso into play full force. There's black licorice also, coffee grounds, and powerful tannins, along with the acids to age."
US,92.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Amici,"This is a big, lush, juicy wine with grip and a fully-formed body, accented with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A great deal for the quality, it's well made and deeply satisfying in highlights of coffee, cedar, mocha and blackberry, girded by a firm structure."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Bodegas Escorihuela,"Quiet and shy on the nose, with generic white-fruit notes. For a medium-dry white, it offers requisite sweetness along with soft fruit notes, candied flavors and a green, lightly vegetal accent. A bit spritzy but not that lively or precise."
US,88.0,17.0,El Dorado,Miraflores,"Made from 100% Barbera, this has perfumed aromatics and flavors of raspberry and peach. It's sweetness is in check?ideal for food with some heat, like Thai or Mexican."
US,87.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Bethel Heights,"The overtly fruity nose features some perfumed cherry fruit, flowers akin to violets and graham cracker. The sharp, chiseled palate has tart touches similar to raspberry coulis. The mouth is simple and smooth, with nothing but red fruit at the foundation."
Italy,90.0,21.0,Etna,Barone di Villagrande,"Dark-skinned berry, Mediterranean herb and forest floor aromas slowly emerge along with a balsamic note. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, vanilla and a hint of oak alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish."
France,90.0,45.0,Champagne,Taittinger,"Tasted from a half bottle, the rich and complex flavors of Brut La FranÃ§aise show just that extra touch of maturity. The wine has peach and almond flavors that contrast well with the taut, nervy edge. It's full in the mouth and ripe, and works well both as an apÃ©ritif and a food Champagne."
US,86.0,10.0,California,Replica,"Made in an overtly oaky manner, this wine imitates the big barrel-fermented style pretty well. It has smoky, buttery aromas, good pear and peach flavors and a smooth, soft texture."
France,92.0,72.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Jean-Claude Boisset,"Still showing its youthful fruity character, this concentrated wine is going to develop richness while always retaining its elegance. The acidity and structured fruit lend a strong sense of minerality, although it keeps its ripeness. Age for 3?? years."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Ribera del Duero,Costaval,"This rings true as a young Ribera. It has a mild foxy/herbal hint to the black-fruit nose, while the palate is wall-to-wall plump, with flavors that don't just settle on boring. With some pepper and heft on the finish, this is good everyday stuff. Nice texture; a bit herbal."
Spain,89.0,24.0,Montsant,Josep Grau Viticultor,"Black cherry, plum and currant aromas are young, bouncy and fresh as a whole. That pretty much describes the palate on this Garnacha-led blend: It's lively, rubbery, tannic and fresh. Blackberry, plum and black currant flavors finish tannic and grabby. Drink through 2017."
US,82.0,16.0,California,Crystal Valley Cellars,"Not badly made, just thin and wanting in flavor. The yield on these Solano and Napa county vines must have been enormous. The mouth sensation is of heat and acidity, with a bit of green strawberry thrown in for good measure."
US,87.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Signorello,"A little light in body and flavor, but easy to drink, with complex raspberry, cherry, blueberry, mocha, tobacco, vanilla, smoke and peppery spice flavors. At its best now. Try with sliced flank steak, stuffed into pita bread with cole slaw."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Toscana,Mazzei,"Made from 80% Sangiovese and 20% Alicante, this opens with aromas of plum, black cherry and baking spice that follow through to the medium-bodied palate along with a hint of clove. It's easy drinking with firm but fine-grained tannins."
US,92.0,42.0,Temecula Valley,Lorenzi Estate,"Hot gravel and tart cranberry aromas are vividly enhanced with roasted jalapeÃ±o pepper notes on this small-batch wine from one of the region's more quality-focused producers. There's lots of fun flavor on the palate, with a bell pepper element quickly evolving into black raspberry and cherry fruits, picking up dusty leather in the midpalate and finishing on fudge brownie."
Australia,91.0,17.0,South Eastern Australia,Insurrection,"This is full-bodied, velvety-textured and expansive in the mouth, delivering plenty of bold cassis, chocolate and sage flavors. Some brighter, red-fruit notes mingle with mocha shadings on the surprisingly long finish."
Argentina,86.0,7.0,Mendoza,Kirkland Signature,"This grapy, fruity Malbec is quite enjoyable. Aromas of boysenberry and blueberry are solid despite some reduction. Plum, boysenberry and creamy oak flavors finish on a note of clove."
US,90.0,25.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Tower 15,"The Huber Vineyard is one of the few places where this grape grows in America, and the wine is always fascinating. Extremely dark in color, it offers unctuous black currant, graphite and licorice aromas. The palate combines mouth-coating tannins with a surprisingly light, acid-driven frame, showing woody elderberry flavors and the grape's telltale minty lift. Not extremely complex, but a fun and different sipper."
Italy,94.0,88.0,Barolo,Ceretto,"Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Adelaida,"Suave aromas of bramble and red berries meet with chipped slate, a touch of anise and pressed lilacs on this nose of this blend of 37% Grenache, 29% MourvÃ¨dre, 13% Syrah, 10% Counoise, 6% Cinsault and 5% Carignane. Bright cranberry and red cherry fruit pop on the palate, which is bolstered by fennel, black peppercorns and dried rose petals."
US,87.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Mercer,"This wine brings aromas of caramel, blue fruit, barrel spice and herb that are followed by elegantly styled fruit flavors and gritty tannins, with a light bitter note that distracts."
Spain,85.0,21.0,Rioja,Ramirez de la Piscina,"A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save."
US,91.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"The aromas of cedar, fresh dark berries, thyme, garden herbs and flowers provide instant appeal, with woodsy accents following. Lively plum and raspberry flavors back them up, with fine-grained tannins and barrel accents speckled throughout."
US,84.0,30.0,Dry Creek Valley,Stella Monsi,"Robust, tannic, spicy, the wine is also rich in wild berry, raisin and prune fruit. In other words, a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue. The official alcohol is 14.5% by volume, but it tastes hotter than that."
Argentina,91.0,88.0,Mendoza,Antigal,"Full aromas of toasty oak, blackberry and vanilla feed into a saturated hard-pointed tartaric palate. Flavors of Christmas spice, oak and baked black fruits display hints of nutmeg and cola on a blocky hard finish. Drink through 2020."
US,83.0,9.0,Alexander Valley,Kirkland Signature,"Definitely inexpensive, but for a few dollars more, one might find more fruit and texture. This is an earthy, basic quaffer that'll please mostly on price."
US,90.0,18.0,Lodi,McCay Cellars,"From 100-plus-year-old Carignane vines, with splashes of Grenache, too, this is a refreshing wine for spring and summer. Stony in grapefruit and peach, it's balanced, light and dry with a fruity kick."
US,88.0,29.0,Napa Valley,Malk,"A pert, savory Sauvignon Blanc, this is brisk with acidity. A tart gooseberry touch shines against a backdrop of pink grapefruits, peaches and limes. A bit of ripeness on the finish will pair well with Vietnamese fare."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Uco Valley,DoÃ±a Paula,"This opens with a gaseous, sulfuric scent followed by aromas of peach pit, apricot, green apple and wet stones. The palate is lean and zesty, while flavors of lemon, tangerine and nectarine finish with a blend of raw acidity and oaky vanilla."
France,90.0,50.0,Champagne,Colin,"Based in VÃ©rtus, at the southern end of the CÃ´te des Blancs, Colin is a family-owned grower. The style is full-on, fruity, but with an attractive oxidative bottle-aged edge that rounds the texture out. There is some tight minerality and the wine is finely in balance."
US,85.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Judd's Hill,"Direct and fruity, with blackberry and blueberry flavors, wrapped into rugged tannins. Finishes a little sweet. Drink over the next few years."
France,86.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Skalli,"A silky, medium-bodied selection, this features elegant notes of cherries, fine leather and baking spices. It's a soft, easy-to-drink wine for immediate consumption."
US,87.0,34.0,North Fork of Long Island,Sannino,"Fresh, primary red-cherry and raspberry flavors get a kick of cherry-cola spice and vanilla here. It's an approachably plummy, juicy red with soft, feathery tannins, but puckering cranberry acidity keeps it fresh. Drink now through 2020."
US,85.0,38.0,Sonoma Coast,Fogline Vineyards,"A confectionary note of marshmallow gives way to lighter intimations of citrus and sour-apple skin, making for a confusing combination of ripeness and tartness."
France,91.0,39.0,FaugÃ¨res,Hecht & Bannier,"Although this is not the newest release from Hecht & Bannier, it is drinking nicely now, with mature notes of kirsch and black currant backed by accents of sweet spice, crushed violets and soft leather. Though aged, the mouth is still full and big with gripping tannins and a firm structure. The finish is long, evoking flavors of cocoa-dusted blackberries and peppery spice. Drink now??014."
US,86.0,29.0,Napa Valley,Marilyn,"A rather ordinary Merlot, dry and rugged, with jammy-fruity flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Blended with Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it needed body and power."
France,92.0,40.0,Vin de Pays de la Haute VallÃ©e du Gassac,Mas de Daumas Gassac,"The almost legendary wine of Gassac is in fact a deeply satisfying, rich but structured southern wine, with a fine balance between spice, red fruits and powerful tannins. There's a raw edge of youth here, confirming that these wines always have considerable aging potential."
Spain,87.0,42.0,La Mancha,Alcardet,"Dusty, gritty citrus aromas are softened by leesy notes and a vanilla scent. The palate is foamy and short on complexity. Flavors of orange, nectarine and white pepper turn slightly bitter, while citric acidity lends freshness to the finish."
Spain,95.0,90.0,Priorat,Clos Mogador,"With its patented blend of ripe plum and berry aromas matched against notes of wood smoke, herbs and leather, this is ripped and focused in the mouth, with strong but manageable tannins. Flavors of buttery oak, schist, blackberry and cassis culminate with mocha, vanilla and an overall sense of greatness. Drink from 2017 through 2025."
US,91.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It draws you into the glass with light, high-toned aromas of herbs, flowers and assorted spices. The palate brings a medley of black and red-fruit flavors, with herbal accents that display deftness, elegance and length. It's drinking well now but should only improve with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2018."
France,89.0,20.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,ChÃ¢teau d'Or et de Gueules,"Full-bodied and chewy, this blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Carignan and 10% Grenache is a spicy, garrigue-laden wine. Notes of cinnamon and cracked pepper accent black cherry fruit, turning to licorice on the dusty finish. Drink now??018."
US,84.0,15.0,California,Besitos,"Sharp and jammy, this has raspberry, peppermint and white pepper flavors. The name means ?little kisses??in Spanish."
Spain,90.0,25.0,Navarra,PrÃ­ncipe de Viana,"Aromas of cherry, plum, forest floor and tobacco feed into a clampy palate with fresh acidity. Lightly spiced currant and red-plum flavors are limited in scope but nice, while this tastes herbal and feels tight and racy on the finish."
US,92.0,85.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reynvaan Family Vineyards,"The aromas are generous, with notes of potpourri, dried herbs and black pepper. The palate is full of citrus and savory flavors that show depth and intensity along with restraint. Savory notes persist on the finish."
US,91.0,20.0,Anderson Valley,Navarro,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication."
France,89.0,25.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau la Chapelle aux Moines,"This generous and full-bodied wine is full of juicy red berry fruits, ripe tannins and just enough structure to support its opulent character. Wood aging gives a fine-grained texture that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016."
Spain,87.0,35.0,Rioja,Solar de Libano,"Aromas of tobacco, vanilla and dried fruit take on a grassy note after airing in the glass. A cool, wet vintage for the region yields a slightly astringent and acidic palate. Flavors of dried plum, cherry and vanilla carry a tart streak, while the finish is both earthy and a bit sour."
US,87.0,22.0,Seneca Lake,Hector Wine Company,Hints of roasted beet and forest floor lend rusticity to ripe red cherry and plum in this full-bodied Cabernet Franc. Crisp acidity lifts and lightens the midpalate. Smooth supple tannins and a hint of truffle linger on the finish.
US,91.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Mira,"Rich and thick in leathery blueberry, this Syrah from the great Carneros-based Hyde Vineyard is a study in full-bodied black licorice and dark chocolate caramel. Though bigger in style, it retains acidity and balance."
Italy,86.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,Cennatoio,"Made with Sangiovese and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of coconut, toast and oak-driven spice. The evolved palate offers coconut, clove and ground black pepper but the fruit richness has almost dried up entirely, leaving an astringent finish."
Argentina,87.0,30.0,Vista Flores,Antucura,"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent."
US,90.0,19.0,Carneros,Buena Vista,"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare."
US,90.0,22.0,California,Matchbook,"Powerful flavors and a muscular structure make this wine big and imposing. It has intense oaky, spicy, earthy and barnyardy aromas. Dark-fruit flavors like blackberry accompany meaty, beefy nuances and a firmly tannic, dry mouthfeel."
US,85.0,35.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Foxen,"Light in color and light-bodied in the mouth, this Grenache-based RhÃ´ne blend offers easy, sweet flavors of cherries, cola, vanilla and oak."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Toro,Bodegas CampiÃ±a,"Dense berry aromas give this wine a pasty, weighty bouquet. It feels scratchy in the mouth, with plum and red-fruit flavors. This wine runs short on  specifics while offering a juicy feel and a hint of chocolaty young oak on the finish."
US,85.0,33.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Siduri,"Not showing many complexities now. It's a big, ripe, fruity wine, with strong flavors of cherries, raspberries and smoky sandalwood, wrapped into a silky texture. Drink now."
US,94.0,55.0,Yakima Valley,Owen Roe,"Sourced from what is arguably Red Willow's finest block of Syrah, this is superbly balanced and remarkably concentrated for this cool site from a cool vintage. Cassis fruit is streaked with licorice and mocha, showing plenty of new oak influence without sacrificing depth or fruit. Drink soon or tuck it away for a few more years; either way it's a gem."
Spain,88.0,18.0,Rioja,Luis CaÃ±as,"For an off vintage, this is a nice wine. It has a touch of leafiness on the nose but also dark fruit, shoe polish and style. Gets better as it airs out, and thus the raspberry and plum flavors take on a forward, easygoing likability. Textured on the finish, and definitely not dilute or choppy like so many others from 2002."
US,88.0,17.0,Monterey County,Ca' del Solo,"This is just the kind of white wine California needs more of. It's crisp in acidity, with a brilliant, unoaky focus of fruit. Best of all, the alcohol is a low 12.5%. There may be some residual sugar, but the tangerine flavors are so crisp, the wine feels dry. What a great sommelier wine."
Italy,88.0,21.0,Chianti Classico,Il Molino di Grace,"Aromas of moist forest floor, truffle, new leather, blue flower and a hint of plum come together in the glass. The fresh, enjoyable palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice and a note of chopped mint while supple tannins and lively acidity give it an easy-drinking nature."
US,93.0,65.0,Mount Veeder,Yates Family Vineyard,"Hard to imagine greater concentration in a Napa Cabernet than you'll find here. It's just insanely rich in blackberries and blueberries and liberally oaked, while the tannins are hard and potent. Nowhere near ready now, even though it's already more than five years old. Give it at least six years in a good cellar, and it could easily go another decade beyond that."
France,93.0,38.0,Alsace,Boeckel,"Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening."
Italy,86.0,32.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,Marchesi Fumanelli,"From the 2004 vintage, this is a thin and slightly sour Valpolicella that would pair with cheesy pizza or ravioli filled with ricotta. The natural freshness and brightness of the fruit will cut through fatty dishes."
Australia,87.0,12.0,South Eastern Australia,Yarraman,"This wine shows exceptional freshness on the nose with newly mown grass, hay and lemon fruit. Yarraman is Aboriginal for ?wild horse??and the palate has an appropriate kick to it, with crisp acidity suppporting complex lanolin, citrus and pineapple flavors. The finish is surprisingly long. Drink now."
US,86.0,18.0,Napa Valley,Wheelhouse,"A little simple, but on the plus side of that word. You'll find plenty of varietal blackberry and cherry flavors, with a kiss of oak and smooth tannins. Drink now."
Argentina,88.0,19.0,Mendoza,Valentin Bianchi,"Pencil eraser, iodine, latex and blueberry aromas settle better than they start. In the mouth, this is saturated and chunky in feel, with toasty flavors of blackberry, licorice and mint that finish long, herbal and loamy."
US,93.0,78.0,Sonoma Coast,Williams Selyem,"The mighty Hirsch rises to the occasion of a burly, near-perfect vintage, showing off its ability to be brawny and brainy at the same time. Black fruit, tar and tea take center stage, with an intensely tannic underbelly specked in wild herb and smoke. This baby needs time. Drink now after decanting or cellar through 2023."
US,94.0,35.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"An absolutely delicious Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the drinkability factor. Supremely ripe cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted by brilliantly crisp acidity to make it all bright and lively. Oak plays second fiddle, contributing rich, tasteful notes of smoke, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast. Just gorgeous for drinking now and for the next 5?? years with your best fare."
US,90.0,55.0,Paso Robles,RN Estate,"The three varieties in this blend are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It's a delicious wine, smooth, dry and tannic, and slightly prickly in alcohol, with deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, and chocolate-covered bacon. Drink over the next few years for maximum freshness."
US,90.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,McCrea,"The first Boushey vineyard Roussanne from McCrea includes a 25% portion of Grenache Blanc. The wine is sharp and high-toned, with a bit of burn to the finish. The fruit flavors dance around the fringes of tropical, with a softer melon core. Though barrel fermented in neutral oak, some tasty, toasty flavors abound."
US,90.0,45.0,Chalk Hill,Chalk Hill,"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors. Complex and intriguing, this unfined, unfiltered Chard should drink well for the next few years."
US,88.0,40.0,Sonoma Valley,Dane Cellars,"High toned, with deep cherry, strawberry and vanilla notes, this wine is velvety and dense, with powerful tannins and a breadth of earthy flavor."
Spain,86.0,10.0,CariÃ±ena,ViÃ±edos y Bodegas Pablo,"Young, jumpy and slightly candied, but that's just fine given the price range it's playing in. To get old-vines Garnacha for a song is not uncommon, yet this wine's thick, fruity palate goes beyond the norm. And with a round mouthfeel built on light-framed tannins, it's easygoing as can be. Drink now, but don't put it under the microscope."
US,94.0,65.0,Paso Robles,Epoch Estate Wines,"Jordan Fiorentini continues to knock socks off with powerful wines, even when led by Grenache, which comprises 55% of this blend along with 27% MourvÃ¨dre and 18% Syrah. Dark raspberries, smashed strawberries, concentrated rose petals, soy and beef jerky lead into energetic flavors of olallieberry, black-slate minerality and blueberry-skin tannins."
France,89.0,19.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Doms,"This is a mineral, textured wine that has fine tannins and balanced ripe black fruits. It's dry, although with an undertow of richness, acidity and weight. It could age, so wait until 2017."
US,93.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gainey,"Complex aromas greet the nose on this top-level offering from a veteran producer, with dark strawberry and black plum treated to a eucalyptus and sagebrush twist. The palate mixes fruit with spice as well, showing raspberry-blackberry juice cut with clove, allspice, nutmeg and Mediterranean herbs."
US,87.0,35.0,California,Thornton,"Richer and more austere than the regular brut, and bone dry, it has a steely elegance. The aromas are delicate but suggest citrus fruits and a touch of strawberry. It?s very well balanced, with crisp acidity. There?s just the slightest hint of fruit on the finish, and then it turns dry and austere again."
US,85.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Domaine LeSeurre,"Dried herb and bramble notes cast a savory shadow to crisp apple, pear and lemon flavors in this sweet-tart Riesling. Brisk acidity enlivens the midpalate."
US,91.0,35.0,El Dorado,A Donkey and Goat,"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2?? years of aging."
France,90.0,50.0,Champagne,Chanoine,"A ripe wine that shows some bottle age, this has flavors of toast and yeasty bread as well as textured acidity and lemon-flavored fruit. Well balanced and with a sense of depth, it is balanced between freshness and maturity, ready to drink."
US,85.0,17.0,Paso Robles,Ancient Peaks,"This vineyard from the Santa Margarita Ranch at the southern end of the appellation produces a wine with blackberry, mint, slate and barrel smoke on the nose. The flavors aren't quite as dynamic, but still present cocoa, berry, beet juice and strongly mouth-coating tannins."
France,91.0,75.0,Champagne,Nicolas Feuillatte,"A soft product of a soft vintage, offering rich fruit as well as a crisp texture. The balance is just right: green apples and lime to go with yeast and acidity that lies neatly under everything. Age this excellent wine for 2?? years."
US,94.0,65.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"This vintage marks a welcome return of Viognier to the otherwise all-red Cayuse portfolio. It's an immaculate, elegant, complex wine, redolent of wet stone, dried herbs (thyme, rosemary), jicama, cucumber, lime, grapefruit, melon and more. It is clear and clean, precise and focused. It does not push the ripeness, or overshoot the cool vintage, and never sacrifices complexity. Fermented and aged in a concrete egg, it's seen no oak at all."
Spain,86.0,17.0,Montsant,Portal del Priorat,"Jammy plum and raspberry aromas are meaty and hint at being plush. A flush, fairly full mouthfeel packs power, while flavors of plum and prune fade toward herbal, with residual weight to the finish."
Spain,84.0,24.0,Rueda,Reina de Castilla,"Pungent and grassy on the nose, with a strong nettle and green herb character. The palate is soft and playful, with pithy white fruit flavors and then a soda-like dry finish. Plump, wayward and a bit green overall."
France,88.0,23.0,Menetou-Salon,Xavier Flouret,"Domaine de Chatenoy, in the same family for 15 generations, has produced this rich, full-flavored wine, packed with sweet strawberry and smooth tannins. It could age, but is ready to drink now."
France,86.0,12.0,Vin de France,Barton & Guestier,"This ripe, cherry-flavored wine has touches of toasty spice from wood aging. It's smooth and soft, with juicy acidity that offsets its rounded texture."
France,85.0,9.0,Vin de France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"A blend of typical Gascon grapes gives a lemon and citrus wine, very fresh, tangy. There is plenty of acidity and an attractive lightness. Screwcap."
US,90.0,19.0,Russian River Valley,Novy,"Like the label says, this Viognier is sweet, with honey, apricot, orange and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with fine acidity. Give it more concentration, and the score would soar. Still, it's a very nice dessert wine for the price."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Animale,"This is actually Wahluke Slope fruit, though labeled simply Columbia Valley. Tart pomegranate fruit, a seam of clay and well-integrated highlights of herb and earth mark this extremely limited-production wine as special. Dolcetto does not have much of a track record in Washington, but what's here is quite promising."
France,85.0,20.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine de la Denante,"Ripe and smooth, this rich wine has enough fruitiness and acidity to give a crisper edge, although it is more about a warm, spicy character. Drink now."
Italy,85.0,22.0,Rosso di Montalcino,La Fortuna,"La Fortuna's Rosso offers contrasting aromas of spice, red apple, wild berry, bramble and cherry liqueur. It boasts a deep ruby color and in the mouth, it feels pointed and edgy."
France,83.0,24.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Beausoleil,This tough wine has overripe fruit. There are tough extracted tannins. It's a hard wine to like.
US,85.0,28.0,Rogue Valley,Kriselle,"Smoky and oaky past the point of balance, this tastes of charred wood rather than fruit. The tannins are chewy and smoky. After considerable breathing time, blackberry fruit emerges. Aeration is highly recommended."
US,86.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Surprisingly full bodied, fruit loaded and instantly appealing, this new Chardonnay from Hogue mixes generous flavors of apple and butter, toasted almonds and a little spice."
Italy,89.0,33.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Giuseppe Campagnola,"Mouthfuls of black cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and cinnamon abound in this wine. It boasts a beautiful structure coupled with elegant freshness. Drink now through the next few years."
US,93.0,110.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Tanner DaFoe,"This luxury-level project by Jeff Tanner and Rob DaFoe delivers aromas of rich blackberry jam nuanced with wet tobacco, loam, tomato leaf and a touch of spearmint. Blackberries and blueberries also line the edges of the palate, but the core is all about spicy tobacco and black pepper. There's lot of acidity four years in, so this will stand the test of time in the cellar. Drink 2017 through 2028."
Spain,92.0,50.0,Campo de Borja,Alto Moncayo,"Like its brothers Veraton and Aquilon, this modern Garnacha opens with hickory, savory berry and balsamic aromas. While it's stout in feel, there's freshness amid the saturation. Flavors of toasty oak, licorice and blackberry finish long, blackened and savory. Drink through 2021."
US,87.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"This is a richer, rounder version of rosÃ©, with tropical mango and pineapple notes as well as lush peach aspects. Moderate acidity keeps it grounded and refreshing."
Italy,87.0,65.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Citille di Sopra,"This robust red opens with aromas suggesting forest floor, truffle, pressed violet and used leather. The hefty palate shows scorching alcohol, licorice and a hint of raisin but not much fruit richness. Clenching tannins leave an extremely astringent finish."
US,87.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Vin du Lac,"A tasty mix of fresh fruit flavors?including melon, peach and nectarine?this is sourced in part from Snipes Mountain's excellent Upland Vineyard. Aged in 100% stainless steel, it's balanced and tight, with good snap to the finish."
Argentina,93.0,65.0,Mendoza,Bodega Renacer,"This is Renacer's first Cabernet Franc, and it's excellent. Light herb notes, fine wood and deep black-fruit aromas make for a superb entry. The palate is loaded with power, but a touch of bold tartaric acidity does stick out. Black cherry, kirsch, mocha and chocolate flavors finish amid a lush mix of chocolaty oak, related spices and deliciousness. Drink through 2021."
US,94.0,225.0,Napa Valley,Diamond Creek,"Perfumed in lavender, violet and mountain sage, this is a lovely wine, as always, softly layered in concentrated flavors of tobacco, cassis and black cherry. Integrated and balanced, though bold, it has a grip of tannin and smoky oak that persists on the lengthy finish."
Spain,91.0,25.0,Priorat,Clos de Tafall,"This is ripe and a bit raisiny with prune and fig notes to the bold bouquet. This feels chunky on the palate, but not fat or out of shape. Baked black fruit and raisin flavors finish solid and ready, with a note of licorice and an overriding sense of richness. Drink through 2020."
US,88.0,25.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Canoe Ridge,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Canoe Ridge, Wallula and Wahluke Slope vineyards. Aromas of dried herbs and leaves, green pepper and cherry are followed by a fruit-filled palate. The tannins come off as a bit scratchy."
France,90.0,16.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Bernadotte,"With the same winemaking team as ChÃ¢teau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree. The wine is full in the mouth, structured and balanced, with ripe berry fruits bursting out from the tannic shell. The wine will develop well over the next few years; drink from 2017."
US,89.0,48.0,Willamette Valley,Big Table Farm,"This fruit-forward, elegant wine offers gentle flavors of strawberry and cherry, with a lightly candied aspect. It's like a cherry lollipop, with a lingering, slightly earthy finish."
Argentina,87.0,20.0,Mendoza,Famiglia Meschini,Peach and cantaloupe aromas are friendly and easy. A creamy palate with modest acidity offers slightly sweet flavors of dulce de leche and melon. A modest finish with spice and sugary notes closes this out.
France,86.0,15.0,Val de Loire,Lieubeau,"This is Chardonnay from the same region as Muscadet giving it a crisp salty character that has been filled out with some oak aging. The wine is ripe, spicy with a mineral character that comes from the granite soil. Drink now."
US,85.0,24.0,Santa Barbara County,R2,"Honey and tuberose contribute to a powerful Orange Crush aroma on this RhÃ´ne white blend of 48% Marsanne, 40% Rousanne and 12% Viognier. Potpourri and flower water carry the palate, with a little slate and slight bitterness on the finish. Serve with a strawberry-spinach salad."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Alto Adige,Girlan,"You'll find aromas of elderflower, hay, crushed rock and a whiff of exotic fruit on this linear white. On the bright palate, assertive acidity underscores grapefruit, green melon, chopped herb and mineral."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Castelli Martinozzi,"Underbrush, cured meat, grilled herb, menthol and dark-skinned fruit aromas unfold in the glass. The chewy palate offers dried black berry, black cherry, licorice, coffee and toasted nut alongside tightly packed tannins. Drink 2019??022."
US,87.0,40.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Paraiso Vineyards,"Best to give this young Pinot a year or two in the cellar, because it's a little too closed to completely enjoy now. It doesn't show the generosity of the '01 or '05, but is more tannic and a little earthier. Should mellow through 2009 and let the cherry flavors emerge."
France,90.0,70.0,Champagne,Drappier,"A blend that includes three ancient Champagne varieties?Arbanne, Petit Meslier and Blanc Vrai?along with Chardonnay. The mix gives a full, perfumed and rich wine, with intense acidity as well as the crispest apple flavor. It is without question a wine for food."
Italy,90.0,26.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,La Ciarliana,"Truffle, new leather and plum are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut red. The palate delivers Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and earthy game flavors, set against bright acidity and tightly wound tannins. Drink 2018??023."
US,88.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Pine & Brown,"Barrel-fermented in French oak, this wine is high in acidity and subtle in wood flavors, offering a brightness of citrus, pear and peach. Seamless on the palate and steely, it's well balanced and elegant."
US,91.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Soos Creek,"Hailing from Slide Mountain and Dineen vineyards, this wine charms with aromas of flowers, toast, clove, cardamom and anise. The pillowy-feeling flavors show richness, depth and detail."
US,92.0,56.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foxen,"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014."
US,83.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Survivant,"Unripe, with green peppercorn, tobacco and dried sage flavors, showing only a slender note of blackberries. Good and dry, but lacks richness. Drink now."
US,88.0,25.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),College Cellars,"This student-produced wine shows aromas of cocoa, cashew and cherry along with green pepper. Flavors are somewhat wood-dominated with vanilla and chocolate riding high over cherry. Overall there are some distractions but there's still much to enjoy."
US,93.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Talisman,"This is the producer's first release from this site. It succeeds wildly with its juicy, tart flavors of cranberry and red cherry that become fleshy and concentrated on the palate. Complex and delicious, it finishes with a thickness of toast and black tea."
US,92.0,35.0,Lodi,Michael David,"A deep, almost-black color goes right to a ruby rim. Aromas suggest dark chocolate and coffee bean and the flavors are concentrated, saturated and delicious, like blackberry and blueberry pie?except nicely dry. This full-bodied wine coats the sides of the mouth but stays velvety and lingers on the finish."
US,93.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),K Vintners,"Hailing from River Rock Vineyard in the Rocks District, this wine's black olive, green stem, potpourri, dark fruit and orange peel aromas are followed by silky feeling fruit and savory flavors. It keeps the interest high."
Italy,90.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,San Polo,"Aromas of menthol, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit come together on this accessible, full-bodied red. The ripe, chewy palate offers cherries marinated in spirits, blackberry jam, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate."
France,85.0,16.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau la Gordonne,"Full, while still crisp, this strawberry and orange flavored rosÃ© is ripe, dry with a touch of pepper and a rounded, smooth character. Screwcap."
US,88.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Green herbs and grass add freshness to the sweet aromas of quince and peach preserves on this interpretation of the Georgian Rkatsiteli grape. Intense fruit flavors persist on the palate, highlighted by lemon-lime acidity and lime-pith astringency."
US,91.0,44.0,Carneros,Domaine Carneros,"The sparkling wine producer shows off its prowess with still wines in this inaugural vineyard-designate from the well-loved Hyde. Tart lemon and green apple flavors highlight a brisk acidity that never tastes lean, and instead offers full-bodied luxury without the weight. Chameleon-like in that way, it's also juicy, structured and dotted in salty lemongrass."
Italy,90.0,50.0,Toscana,Russo,"This Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend sees 16 months in barrique; the result is redolent of chocolate, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and dried herbs backed by lovely fresh blueberry and blackberry. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with very good freshness and length."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Palazzetta,"Earthy leather, forest floor, herb and balsamic aromas emerge in the glass. The taut, wiry palate offers sour cherry, dried sage and clove flaavors, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that leave a firm finish. Give it a few more years to soften, then drink to capture the remaining fruit."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Sierra de Salamanca,La Zorra,"Plum and berry aromas are tight and focused, with no indication of oak. A blend of Tempranillo and Rufete, this wine is snappy and drawing in feel. Plum and currant flavors finish long and juicy, with ripping acidity."
Italy,91.0,35.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Di Filippo,"Earthy aromas of leafy underbrush, leather, ripe blackberry, savory herb and baking spice lead the nose on this warm, full-bodied red. The lush, juicy palate offers ripe black plum, fig, black pepper and graphite alongside velvety tannins. A licorice note signals the close."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,CarpenÃ¨ Malvolti,"There's a touch of burnt almond at the start, but this bright effort soon picks up speed thanks to delicate aromas of honey, cantaloupe and white peach. This is smooth and creamy on the finish."
US,85.0,38.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"This Pinot is quite tart, giving the cherry and cola flavors a sweet and sour candy taste. It's nicely dry and spicy, but that acidity really cuts."
Italy,87.0,45.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Montresor,"Aromas of scorched earth, game, dried rose petal and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. The aromas follow through to the solid palate together with overripe black cherry, bitter walnut and a confectionary note alongside grainy tannins. It's a bit rustic but still has an earthy appeal."
France,86.0,12.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Haut Pougnan,"A fruity, perfumed wine that has attractive acidity as well as spice. The black currant fruit gives the wine a crisp edge as well as an easy approachability. Drink now."
US,88.0,17.0,Washington,Trinity Vineyards,"Sourced from Coyote Canyon in the Horse Heaven Hills, this wine offers aromas of honeysuckle and peach along with a light vanilla accent. It's full bodied and somewhat viscous in feel with abundant apricot flavors."
US,87.0,34.0,Sonoma Coast,MacRostie,"This is a dry, elegant young Pinot Noir. It's rich in acidity, and the cherry and cola flavors are sprinkled with zesty white pepper. Seems to be giving its best now."
US,86.0,38.0,Virginia,Winery at La Grange,"A bramble patch of aromas and flavors comes to mind in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot: spicy raspberry, blackberry and green stems are prominent. The palate is silky and round in feel, with soft tannins melding against a veil of vanilla and butter."
US,95.0,75.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Corliss Estates,"A five-grape blend from a range of outstanding vineyards?Stillwater, Dionysus, Bacchus, Sagemoor and Weinbau. The detail and the dance between delicate nuances of vineyard and vine, and the supple berry and black fruit flavors, make this a wine to contemplate as well as savor. Can be drunk young for its vitality and superb structure, or cellared for another decade or more."
France,85.0,10.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Vignobles Fontan,"This is a bright wine with 90% Merlot. It has black-currant crispness and acidity. The tannins are light and the wine, ready to drink young and fruity, will be best slightly chilled."
France,88.0,20.0,Vouvray,Domaine Vincent CarÃªme,The touches of wood aging are apparent in the almond and toasty edge to this perfumed wine. Quince and apricot fruit show strongly through the tight dry texture and minerality. It's a wine made to be drunk young with great fruit. Drink now.
Argentina,86.0,9.0,Mendoza,Alma del Sur,"This has simple aromas of plum, berry and sweet vanilla. The palate feels fresh, with a citrusy bounce and flavors of raspberry, red plum and mellow spice. The finish is sweet and comported."
France,93.0,65.0,Champagne,Ruinart,"Ruinart's Blanc de Blancs is structured and intensely minerally, but with a rich, full, creamy palate. It is finely balanced?elegant yet fruity?with a bright, crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
US,86.0,18.0,California,Indian Rock,"Made from the winery's vineyard in Calaveras County, this white wine is dry and crisp to the point of tart, in the manner of a Pinot Grigio. Offers flavors of citrus fruits, white peach and spices, with a tangy bite of nasturtium flower."
US,90.0,28.0,Washington,Stemilt Creek,"This is the highlight of an excellent lineup from Stemilt Creek. It brings the same smooth, round fruit forward flavors as the other wines, but adds in more details with citrus, olive and green tea flavors streaking through. The finish gets downright sexy, with a strong wash of chocolate and caramel. It's made for immediate enjoyment rather than cellaring."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,Il Molino di Grace,"Aromas of underbrush, ripe dark-skinned fruit, clove, espresso and a balsamic note lead the nose of this structured Sangiovese. The generous palate delivers juicy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2016??021."
US,84.0,15.0,California,Bargetto,"At the time of tasting, this wine was slightly sparkling, providing a pleasant tingle to the lemon, lime and yeast flavors."
France,90.0,25.0,Sauternes,ChÃ¢teau la Tour Blanche,"This soft wine is still waiting for its intensity to come through. The acidity is there, as is ripe, honeyed fruit. Wait until 2022 to open it."
US,91.0,45.0,Red Mountain,Fidelitas,"This young vineyard is starting to make a name for itself with winemakers, and this 100% varietal wine demonstrates why. It's a classically Washington Merlot that shows appealing aromas of milk chocolate-covered raspberries. The feel is supple with sweet, luscious red fruit flavors that linger."
Italy,90.0,36.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,La Ciarliana,"Licorice, grilled herb, mature black-skinned fruit and balsamic aromas take shape in the glass. The juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed blackberry, orange zest and spice flavors, with a saline hint of cured meat. Chewy tannins provide lend structure."
Australia,91.0,17.0,Clare Valley,Wakefield,"This is a classically styled Clare Riesling, from its hints of talcum powder, green apple and lime to its precise line and crisp finish. It's dry and undeniably tart and citrusy?perfect for aging 4?? years."
US,90.0,75.0,Oregon,King Estate,"Made from single (777) clone, organically-grown grapes, the Blackjack Block Pinot Noir is focused and complex. The mid-palate shows flesh and fat, ripe berry and cherry fruit, with a backing of citrusy acids. Its middle is its strength; it would benefit from blending to add more depth to both front and back."
Argentina,86.0,13.0,Mendoza,Laberinto,"Grassy aromas of red currant suggest cowhide. This has a grabby narrow palate with green-leaning raspberry flavors. Overall, this is fresh and wiry in style, with a choppy, mildly tannic finish."
Italy,84.0,15.0,Salento,Masserie Pisari,"Aromas of candied fruit shape a ripe and slightly jammy wine with aromas of cooked blueberry and bramble. The wine is not too thick and heavy and, in fact, adds a refreshing element of crispness in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
France,91.0,58.0,Pomerol,Clos Beauregard,"Produced from 40-year-old vines on a 15-acre vineyard, the wine is almost entirely Merlot. It has dense, dark tannins and signs of wood aging that will integrate with time. It is a very fine, rich wine with black-plum fruit flavors. The aftertaste brings out the acidity and black currant fruits."
US,83.0,10.0,Washington,Radius,"In a kitchen sink blend that is just over half Merlot, it's the Syrah that pops with its notes of black and green olive accented by orange peel. With 20g/L residual sugar, it coats the palate end to end with overtly sweet fruit flavors."
Australia,92.0,17.0,McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills,D'Arenberg,"Neither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example. Scents of wet stone and flower-shop greens lead into off-dry flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The balance between sugar and acids, lithe body and long finish is finely judged. Drink now??025."
France,88.0,14.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,ChÃ¢teau de la Ragotiere,"This wine has great swathes of green fruits, like biting into a crisp apple. It's bright, shimmering with citrus and grapefruit. There is a tight, mineral bite at the end."
US,89.0,40.0,Willamette Valley,Walnut City WineWorks,"The vineyard is in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, though the label does not indicate it. There is a welcome purity to the fruit expression, pretty cherry flavors with a suggestion of hard candy. Although it has light herb and stem highlights, nothing overshadows the lovely fruit."
US,89.0,30.0,Mendocino County,Ranchero Cellars,"This Paso producer went north to find old-vine Carignan, a totally worthwhile effort with the wine showing aromas of hugely ripe strawberry and watermelon Jolly Rancher, the tannins smooth and dusty. An easy drinking wine, a hint of Pastis lingers at the end."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenuta Vitanza,"Spearmint, plum, oak, and menthol aromas take shape in the glass. The dense palate shows ripe plum, espresso, vanilla and licorice alongside bracing tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2018."
France,89.0,42.0,Sancerre,Domaine Vincent Delaporte,"Fruity wine, wild strawberry flavors that are cut through with juicy acidity. Touches of wood support the soft, ripe tannins of this structured, generous wine. Age for 3?? years."
US,93.0,78.0,Diamond Mountain District,En Garde,"This is a limited-production offering from a tiny appellation, blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. CrÃ¨me de cassis and Bing cherry give it an unexpected expansiveness of juicy texture, with jolts of tobacco and dried herb playing on the palate before a balanced finish wraps it up in a dry, resolved bow."
US,87.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Murrieta's Well,"A rich, mid-weight red blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 23% Malbec and 5% Petite Sirah, Murrieta Well's The Spur is balanced, soft in tannins and makes for a tasty midweek wine."
France,85.0,12.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau MÃ©zain,"This wine has some structure, with enough tannins to sustain the red-berry fruits. It's juicy, with stalky acidity and an attractive texture that will allow it to age a few months. Drink from early 2017."
US,91.0,42.0,Ballard Canyon,Casa Dumetz,"Mulberries and exotic plums mix with river rocks and hibiscus flowers on the nose of this very quaffable and inviting bottling, one of the best in the winery's Grenache study. It's broad and playful on the palate with flavors that perfectly reflect the aromas. With a slight chill, this would be a great red for brunch."
Argentina,84.0,10.0,Valle de Uco,Salentein,"Earthy, murky, raw aromas of generic berry fruits topped with vanilla and marshmallow set up a chunky but lazy palate with herbal plum flavors that border on green."
US,84.0,27.0,Virginia,Narmada,"This wine has intense aromas of blueberry pie and vanilla, along with a barnyard note. The palate is jammy in prune and baked berry flavors. There is a yeasty and resinous quality as well. The finish is long, tart and mouthwatering, with a charred-oak note on the back."
US,95.0,45.0,Chehalem Mountains,Alloro,"Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit."
US,91.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Duckhorn,"Hard tannins make this wine difficult to approach now, as they usually do for young Duckhorn Cabs. But it's quite a success for the chilly 2010 vintage, showing lush blackberry and cherry fruits and fine acidity. As tough as the tannins are, they're well structured, a strong suggestion that the wine, which includes Merlot, should have an easy time aging.  Start drinking it in 2016."
Italy,88.0,24.0,Collio,Sturm,"This bright, fragrant wine offers aromas of an orchard in bloom, spring flower, peach and a hint of banana. The crisp palate shows crunchy apple, pear and mineral alongside bracing acidity. A light almond note signals the crisp close."
US,87.0,30.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Siduri,"Spicy and succulent, with superripe flavors of melted cherry jam, milk chocolate, raspberry pie filling, cola and pepper spice. Dry, but a little too soft for all that richness."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Barbaresco,Prunotto,"This opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, game, scorched earth, sweat and ripe dark fruit. The chewy palate delivers juicy wild cherry, star anise and grilled herb framed in solid tannins."
France,81.0,20.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau la VerriÃ¨re,"This wine is all wood, with no promise of fruit."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"Subdued aromas convey strawberry with a whiff of green tomato. The palate offers crushed cherry, raspberry, oregano and black olive, while lithe tannins provide the framework. It closes on a tart note of rhubarb."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Ribera del Duero,Finca Torremilanos,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road."
US,85.0,14.0,North Coast,Souverain,"This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes."
Argentina,85.0,16.0,Uco Valley,DoÃ±a Paula,"Grapey and inky on the nose, this feels saturated and a bit hot on the palate, with a candied blueberry flavor leading to a grapey finish. Tasted twice, months apart, with similar findings; this score reflects both tastings."
US,89.0,26.0,Sonoma County,Seghesio,"Good, bright, spicy fruit, with fine balance and a silky, extended finish. There's lovely concentration in the back end, suggesting blackberries and loganberries and plenty of toast."
France,91.0,42.0,Saint-Aubin,Jean-Claude Boisset,"Opulent, ripe and fruity, this is classic Saint-Aubin. Generous fruitiness is balanced with crisp acidity and touches of minerality and spicy wood. Its fruitiness makes it accessible now, but several years' aging will make it even better and certainly more complex."
US,92.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"Only 120 cases of this wine from the Sonoma Coast, where cool weather limits ripeness. There are Burgundian aromas of grilled meat, raw meat and mushroom, with dark berries. Very dry, but with a glyceriney sweetness, it's light and supple on the palate. Might age; might not. This is still unexplored territory for Pinot Noir."
US,93.0,75.0,Rockpile,Hunt & Ryde,"This is a quiet blend of 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc, 19% Malbec, 18% Merlot and 18% Petit Verdot. It's delicate and light in toasted oak, with clove, tobacco, blueberry and cassis flavors. It finishes on a lingering licorice note."
France,86.0,29.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Haut Beyzac,"From an estate just to the west of Saint-EstÃ¨phe, this wine is structured and firm. A dry core of solid tannins balances the black-currant fruitiness. The wine is firm now although it will develop quickly, so drink from 2017."
US,87.0,24.0,Napa Valley,Ballentine,"An interesting Merlot that shows a huge improvement over the '02 and '03, possibly because the vintage was warmer and the fruit got ripe. The winery still has work to do on this bottling, but the '04 is tannic and rich, and shows the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors you want in an ultrapremium Merlot."
US,92.0,48.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Jamie Slone Wines,"Lush aromas of dried rose petals, black currant jam, turned loam and fudge greet the nose on this blend of 63% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot. A wide array of flavors hits the palate, from pencil lead, thyme, tomato leaf and black pepper to boysenberry, shaved dark chocolate, vanilla bean and cooked black cherries."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,La Tunella,"Opening aromas of wildflowers and pears lead to a subtle palate offering tart green apple, juicy nectarine and Barltett pear alongside crisp acidity. Pair this with appetizers and light first courses or sip as an apÃ©ritif."
US,89.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Occidental Road Cellars,"Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer."
US,93.0,38.0,Mendocino,Townley,"A worthy followup to the dramatic '08. Bone dry and zesty in cool-climate acidity, it shows bracing flavors of steely minerals, Meyer lemons, limes and buttered toast. A terrifically complex, Chablis-style wine made for upscale fare, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years."
US,85.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ryan Patrick,"There is nothing wrong with this wine, but it shows no particular varietal character. It's a soft, mocha-inflected, all-purpose red."
US,94.0,135.0,Napa-Sonoma,Pride Mountain,"This is a great Cabernet, blended with a drop of Petit Verdot. It shows the intensity of mountain fruit, with incredibly concentrated black currant and cassis flavors, with superb tannins. Few Cabernets have shown this degree of ageability. Drink now??024"
Argentina,84.0,10.0,Mendoza,Alma del Sur,"Sweet red-fruit aromas are mild and earthy. This feels rough on its own but will drink well with food. Flavors of plum, berry and chocolate lead to a similar-tasting, medium finish."
US,91.0,58.0,Sonoma Coast,Pali,"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste. Savory dark berry wraps itself around mushroomy truffles and black tea to linger on the tongue through a lengthy, weighty finish."
France,91.0,145.0,Volnay,Domaine Jacques Prieur,"This wine is quite firm, but with plenty of black fruits under the severe exterior. Heavy losses from hail don't seem to have affected the ripeness and the structure of what will develop into a very fine wine. It offers spice and a touch of chocolate at the end."
Italy,85.0,20.0,Barbaresco,Cancello del Barone,"This opens with whiffs of resin, stewed prune and exotic spice. The raspy palate is extremely evolved, showing mint, a note of raisin and the warmth of alcohol despite the modest declaration of 13.5% alcohol on the label. The fruit is drying up quickly so drink soon."
France,87.0,52.0,Champagne,Nicolas Feuillatte,"An onion skin pink is an attractive start to this fresh, red fruited wine. It is crisp, but not bone dry, having a soft texture. There is a fine balance of acidity of fruit, giving a light-bodied wine good as an apÃ©ritif."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau le Grand Verdus,"This concentrated, herbal wine has a good balance between the great fruit and the tangy, zesty texture. With its fruity character and spicy aftertaste, it's already a pleasure to drink."
US,89.0,24.0,El Dorado,Skinner,"This wine's prominent buttery aromas grab one's attention right away, and that same buttery element runs through the flavors and lingers on the finish. The fruit components are mild and melon-like, the body is medium and the texture reveals good acidity."
US,85.0,22.0,California,South Coast,"Cut grass, crisp green pears, honeydew melon, lime blossoms and a touch of passionfruit combine for a complex nose on this rarely seen grape. The palate is much more simplistic and flat though, with apple and pear-juice flavors enhanced by hints of brown sugar and spice."
France,90.0,33.0,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,"With no indication on the label, it would be hard to know that this is a sweet wine. That is a shame, because the wine itself is ripe and opulent, layering honey and sweet lychee flavors. There's even room for an attractive edge of acidity."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Sicilia,Valle dell'Acate,"With loads of white flower and honey notes, Zagra (100% Grillo) is fresh and clean, with lingering tones of almond skin, jasmine and orange blossom. The finish is crisp and lean."
US,87.0,90.0,Sonoma Valley,Audelssa,"This bone-dry wine is rather severe in tannins. It feels elegant, but lacks immediate reward, with cherry, currant and tobacco flavors that disappear into a cloak of astringency. Could develop after 2011, but no guarantees."
US,83.0,26.0,Calistoga,Vermeil,"Vanilla cream and a stony minerality form around a bitterness of preserved lemon and a touch of heat, that takes on an abundance of intensity on the finish."
US,92.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Irresistible from the get-go, this fragrant wine offers up inviting aromas of citrus, stone and exotic tropical fruits. Flavors of ripe peaches, brightened with vivid acidity, keep it in perfect balance. The 1.4% residual sugar is barely noticeable; the finish lingers gracefully and refreshes the palate, inviting the next sip."
Italy,92.0,70.0,Barolo,Negretti,"This shows some of the heat of the 2005 vintage. It is bold and black, with enduring aromas of cherry, prune, leather, spice and licorice. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Chianti Superiore,Poggio al Casone,"Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with plum and violet aromas. Mellow tannins frame a palate of red cherry and baking spice flavors. Enjoy soon."
US,87.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Guardian,"This wine is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon and 47% Merlot. The aromas are light, with notes of blue fruit, ripe red apple, herb and barrel spice. The palate is medium bodied, with a tart uplift on the finish."
US,92.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Morell-PeÃ±a,"Aromas of pear, lees and tropical fruit lead to a rich flavorful palate, absolutely loaded with tropical-fruit flavors that show a delightful sense of balance. The oak usage (25% new French) is judicious, allowing the fruit to shine."
Italy,85.0,25.0,Nebbiolo d'Alba,CÃ  Richeta,"This high-octane wine offers sensations of toasted oak, sawdust and evident alcohol. It's warm and evolved without much fruit richness."
US,88.0,13.0,California,Korbel,"This is a special bottling with a fancy new label that commemorates Korbel's 130th anniversary. It's slightly sweet and easy to drink, with rich, creamy flavors of honey, orange and vanilla. The blend is Chenin Blanc, French Colombard and Chardonnay."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Maremma Toscana,Rocca di Frassinello,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese, Poggio alla Guardia is bright, clean and enjoyable, and it exudes notes of cherry, blackberry and spice. It would pair seamlessly with red meat, chicken or pasta."
Italy,88.0,44.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Rasina,"Aromas of toast, coconut, thyme, vanilla and sugared plum cake lead the nose. The round, accessible palate offers black-cherry-marinated in spirits, licorice and a confectionary note framed in mature tannins. Ripe and evolving quickly, this is best suited for near- to mid-term enjoyment."
Italy,87.0,36.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Corte Lenguin,"This 70-30 Corvina and Rondinella Amarone blend is slightly disjointed on the nose with contrasting aromas of toasted oak and ripe fruit. It makes a nice impression in the mouth, however, thanks to its smooth, rich texture."
Italy,93.0,50.0,Toscana,Mazzei,"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine opens with aromas of red berries, sweet baking spice, grilled herbs and a whiff of cedar. The structured but almost weightless palate doles out ripe red currants, red raspberries, licorice, mocha and white pepper. Supple, smooth tannins weave alongside the juicy flavors. Drink through 2016??022."
US,86.0,29.0,Russian River Valley,Balverne,"Honeyed in apple, pear and mango, this is a tightly wound, full-bodied wine, voluptuous and quite ripe in style."
Australia,85.0,13.0,South Australia,Yalumba,"Made in a crisp linear style, this is picked at a modest level of ripeness. The result is a relatively low alcohol wine, but one that lacks generosity, instead offering one-dimensional notes of tart grapefruit that linger on the finish."
US,95.0,42.0,Anderson Valley,Lazy Creek,"Full-bodied and generously flavorful, this is shaped and accented by oak influences, but still governed by rich, enticing flavors of ripe plum, dark cherry, blackberry and cinnamon. It features great depth of flavor, breadth in the silky texture and length on the finish. Best now through 2020."
US,88.0,33.0,Washington,Ken Wright,"Made from Celilo Vineyard fruit, this has a sharp-toned bite to its aromas and flavors. Hints of tropical fruits can be found, but the core of the wine is citrusy. A suggestion of light caramel surfaces on the finish."
US,85.0,19.0,Virginia's Eastern Shore,Chatham,"This Cabernet Franc?with 10% Petit  Verdot?has easygoing black-cherry and raspberry notes, plus mocha and turmeric subtleties. It has light, pliant tannins, while the medium to high amount of acids keep the palate feeling energetic."
Italy,88.0,39.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Sesti,"Wild berry, mature black plum and orange zest aromas lead the nose on this brawny wine. The palate delivers black cherry, mushroom, black pepper, tobacco and licorice alongside big but rounded tannins. It's not an ager so enjoy soon."
France,91.0,100.0,Champagne,Jean Laurent,"With the dominance of Pinot Noir in the Aube region, it is no surprise to find a vintage Champagne that is 100% from that grape. With a round character from the Pinot, as well as a hot vintage, this is a full-bodied wine with vibrant fruit and lively acidity. Drink now."
US,88.0,30.0,North Fork of Long Island,Bedell,"Chalky oyster shell and saline notes accentuate the brisk, brash feel of this light-footed Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh apple and lemon flavors are accented by whispers of vanilla and spice. The finish is cutting and crisp."
US,83.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"A slightly funky, earthy nose gives way here to a red that offers pepper, tobacco and a touch of tart cherry on the palate. The flavors and tannins are good and balanced, though the wine is simple."
US,89.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Brian Carter Cellars,"Two thirds Tempranillo, this Spanish-style red blend is filled out with 17% Merlot, 6% Grenache, and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is dark and compact, but nicely framed with barrel spices that add some welcome sweetness. Tannins are hard and the finish brings in a broad swath of earth, tar and bark."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Etna,Benanti,"Pietramarina (a pure expression of Carricante) shows light touches of lemon rind and exotic fruit followed by etched mineral notes of crushed granite and brimstone. The finish is tight, fresh and capped by a slightly menthol-like sensation."
Italy,88.0,54.0,Barolo,Gigi Rosso,"Iris, wild berry and a whiff of camphor aromas lead the nose. The tightly wound but straightforward palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, crushed herb and dark spice notes alongside bright acidity and assertive, rather grainy tannins. Drink after 2023."
US,90.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Panther Creek,"This is a fine representation of the high-quality, fruit-laden 2012 vintage. Forward and ripe, it's packed with cherry fruit that shows a bit of candy at its center, then rolls into a lingering finish with hints of spice and caramel."
US,91.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Arbor Crest,"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins. Another Arbor Crest wine with a fine, fragrant bouquet, clean and bursting with fresh fruit scents. It was barrel aged for 20 months in 40% new oak, adding some strength to the tannins and hints of toast to the finish."
US,92.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Loring Wine Company,"While lower-priced than some of the Loring single-vineyard wines, this offers compelling characteristics and complexity. It smells like red and black cherries, black tea and cardamom, and tastes ripe but tangy. Full bodied and very flavorful, it stays well balanced by firm acidity and fine tannins."
Spain,89.0,18.0,Rioja,ViÃ±estral,"Plum, cherry, cassis and earth aromas are as is, with little nuance or complexity. In the mouth, this is plump, maybe a bit chunky. Quiet, ripe plum and spice flavors finish with more of the same and little to no change. Drink now."
US,86.0,21.0,Yakima Valley,Kestrel,"This wine's perfumed melon, white flower, vanilla and baking spice scents are followed by broad stone fruit flavors that finish tart. It goes down easy."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Rioja,ViÃ±a Herminia,"Punchy berry aromas lead to a fresh, direct palate with fairly sharp acidity. This shows flavors of plum, berry, herbs and spice, which are standard for Rioja. A lasting finish with mild oak and acidic snap wraps up this easy-to-gauge Crianza."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Sextant,"Concentrated strawberry and plum blossom aromas are boosted with iron and a touch of oak smoke on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Steve Martell. The palate shows ripe red currant, woody elderberry brush and a shred of asphalt."
US,91.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Rusack,"A beautiful Syrah, dry, full-bodied and tannic, that shows lots of class and elegance at this price. It has rich, complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red currants and oak, with earthy, leathery, bacon and licorice notes. Needs a few years to come around due to the tannins, or give it a good decant."
US,86.0,16.0,Sonoma County,Valley of the Moon,"A pretty Sangiovese, gentle and easy to drink now. With crisp acidity, it has flavors of sour cherry candy, tobacco, red licorice and peppery spices."
US,87.0,16.0,Mendocino,Brutocao,"A Chardonnay highly strung with green apple and lemon flavor, this wine evolves in the glass, deepening with fruit and minerality. The finish suggests vanilla. A good wine for creamy chicken and seafood meals."
US,86.0,18.0,California,Indian Rock,"Made from the winery's vineyard in Calaveras County, this white wine is dry and crisp to the point of tart, in the manner of a Pinot Grigio. Offers flavors of citrus fruits, white peach and spices, with a tangy bite of nasturtium flower."
US,95.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cayuse,"Always a standout, this is the only one of the Cayuse Syrahs that is cofermented with Viognier. This explodes with flavors of blueberries, soy, earth, black tea, iodine, anise and salt, plus a hint of sassafras. Notes of herb and cured meat add further interest to this unique, captivating effort."
France,88.0,70.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,ChÃ¢teau de Santenay,"This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2017."
US,85.0,65.0,Monterey County,Talbott,"At about four years of age, Talbott's '04 tastes overripe. It has the aromas and flavors of a botrytized, late-harvest Chardonnay, brimming with apricot jam and pineapples, except that it's bone dry. With the very high acidity, this makes it unbalanced and not entirely enjoyable. This is a bottling that seems to do better in cooler vintages."
France,89.0,32.0,Sancerre,Michel Redde et Fils,"Fresh and herbal, this young, textured wine shows green fruits and crisp acidity right up front, making it immediately attractive. Drink it now for this fruit or wait until later in 2017 for it to soften."
France,84.0,25.0,Alsace,Domaine Bernhard & Reibel,"A white fruit note leads this wine on a rich, spice-strewn path. The acidity cuts into the richness, putting the slightly oxidative character into perspective. With its rich, yeasty character, it's fit for drinking now."
Argentina,93.0,120.0,Mendoza,Bodega Catena Zapata,"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful. And that pretty much describes the palate: beautiful berry fruit rides a wave of richness that comes with accents of vanilla and pepper. Sexy, alluring wine with character."
US,87.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Burnt Bridge,"This wine is two-thirds Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Mesquite, dark cherry, vanilla, herb and spice aromas lead to tart, tingly flavors with bunched up tannins."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Alto Adige,Niedermayr Josef,"This polished blend of 80% Pinot Bianco and 20% Chardonnay features aromas of Golden Delicious apple, peach, passion fruit and vanilla that carry over to the palate along with lemon drop. Aging partly in barrels gives it structure, while fresh acidity generates a crisp, clean finish."
France,90.0,50.0,Champagne,Pol Roger,"With its extra touch of richness and a feeling of maturity, this remains a benchmark nonvintage Champagne. It has flavors of ripe white fruits, balancing acidity with just a touch of final softness."
US,90.0,36.0,Monterey County,Big Basin,"This appellation blend of Bradley Brown's Pinot projects aims at a low-alcohol, greener style, thanks to 85% whole-cluster inclusion, with green peppercorns, Kalamata olives, tomato leaf and even jalapeÃ±o on the nose. Those qualities make the palate incredibly interesting though very light and what many consumers may find underripe, with touches of strawberry fruit, dried dill, graphite and eucalyptus."
US,90.0,36.0,Napa Valley,Burgess,"Full bodied, this estate-made, 100% varietal wine is sinewy and dense, a combination of ripe, luscious blackberry and blueberry, akin to a compote, seasoned in lavender and black licorice. Weighty, it'll pair well with wintertime meals, finishing with a suggestion of vanilla bean."
US,87.0,32.0,Virginia,QuiÃ©vremont,"Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed."
France,89.0,96.0,CÃ´te RÃ´tie,Tardieu-Laurent,"This medium- to full-bodied wine is smooth in texture, not overly firm or tannic. Floral and peppery notes accent cassis-tinged fruit, which finishes in a flourish of supple tannins. Drink now??022."
US,93.0,29.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Kessler-Haak,"There's a complex blend of oak, citrus and butter on the nose of this wine, like a sourdough roll cooked over a campfire and then topped with lemon marmalade. The well-balanced palate further blends the experience, with smoke and vanilla coalescing around Mexican lime and yellow apple, culminating in a finish redolent with hard butterscotch candies."
US,87.0,53.0,Sonoma Coast,Flocchini,"This Pinot is starting to lose its primary fruit, and it's gradually becoming mushroomy and earthy. But the raspberry and cherry flavors are still plentiful, and the finish is dry and clean. It's an interesting, complex wine to drink now."
France,91.0,45.0,Champagne,Piper-Heidsieck,"The quality of this nonvintage wine from Piper-Hedsieck is a sign of the increasing quality of the range as a whole. It's a wine that hovers comfortably between freshness and maturity, between a soft dosage and crisp fresh apples. This bottling is ready to drink."
France,88.0,15.0,Montagne-Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau La Fleur Plaisance,"This shows the rich density of Merlot in 2009, giving a solid structure, with dried fruit and red berry flavors and a concentrated line of tannins. Big and dense, this is ready to age."
US,91.0,24.0,Chalone,Chalone Vineyard,"Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity. Judging from the very long, sweet finish, it's got quite a life ahead of it."
US,89.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,Patton Valley,"Bright, clean, crisply rendered raspberry fruit?nicely spiced?really shines here. This relatively modestly priced cuvÃ©e carries itself with style and elegance, still young, tight and tart, with plenty of medium-term aging potential."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Inspire Moore,"Rich, ripe aromas of mango and guava lend a distinctly tropical feel to this off-dry Riesling. It's juicy and lush on the palate, with sweet grapefruit and tangerine flavors offset by a swathe of fresh, green herbs on the finish."
US,82.0,10.0,California,Barefoot Bubbly,"Simple and rough in texture, with medicinal citrus fruit and dough flavors."
US,88.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Cosentino,"This soft, jammy wine from a good vintage is medium bodied and not overly oaken, offering black cherry and vanilla in equal measure. On the finish is a note of pomegranate puree."
US,92.0,36.0,Napa Valley,Keenan,"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautÃ©ed mushrooms."
US,90.0,150.0,Napa Valley,La Sirena,"From winemaker Heidi Barrett's own brand, this Cab is tightly wound in cranberry and tart cherry, before evolving in the glass into a textured, layered experience of toasty oak and a lush, silkiness on the palate. It finishes with a touch of cedar, and should cellar well, through 2021."
Argentina,88.0,25.0,Mendoza,Don Miguel GascÃ³n,"This creamy, oaky Malbec opens with aromas of rubber and raw oak, although with airing black plum, blackberry and chocolate scents rise up. Full, creamy and jammy in feel, this tastes of black plum, blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. A heady, oaky, sticky finish wraps it up."
US,92.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Schulz,"A beautiful wine that tastes much richer than you usually get for this price. Shows gorgeously ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into refined tannins and finishing long and spicy. A blend of Syrah, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon."
France,84.0,10.0,Bordeaux,Maison Duhard,"The Chartrons is the neighborhood of Bordeaux where the wine merchants traditionally worked. This branded Bordeaux is softly ripe, with an attractive density along with a dry core of tannins. Ready to drink now."
Spain,89.0,15.0,Rueda,MarquÃ©s de la Concordia,"Tropical-fruit aromas are slightly oily but on target for Verdejo. This wine displays a full, round palate held together by acidity and white-fruit tannins. Lightly salty grapefruit flavors finish moderately long, with citrus overtones. Drink as soon as possible."
France,89.0,30.0,Alsace,Domaine FranÃ§ois Schmitt,A faint nose of tart red currant turns into a subtly flavored palate rich with cranberry notes and gentle herbal notes of hay flowers. This subtlety is also expressed in the fine mousse and the long dry but very full-fruited finish.
France,90.0,30.0,MÃ©doc,Bernard Magrez,The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential. It is a ripe wine that is also stylish with attractive acidity and plenty of black-currant fruitiness. The wine is developing well and it should be ready to drink from 2018.
Argentina,81.0,15.0,Argentina,Battle Axe,"Dark, oaky and fiery on the nose, but soft and globular in the mouth, with raisin and prune flavors. The finish is heavy and dark, but severely raisiny. This is a bit overripe."
France,90.0,35.0,Chablis,La Chablisienne,"The small CÃ´te de LÃ©chet Premier Cru offers a steely vision of Chablis?crisp and driven by apple and grapefruit flavors. It is bright and taut; like any wine from this vineyard, it needs to age for at least three years."
US,87.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Matthews Estate,"Solid Syrah character is evident?pomegranate, wild berry, and gamy streaks of soy and earth and peppery spice woven into the flavors. Light chocolate adds interest to the finish, but some chalkiness (from unintegrated acids?) detracts from the finish."
US,89.0,22.0,Lodi,Harney Lane,"Imagine coffee ice cream drizzled with boysenberry syrup and you get the gist of the flavors of this full-bodied, rather sweet Zinfandel. Aromas of toasted oak barrels and fresh roasted coffee beans leap out of the glass as you sniff, then rich cherry and boysenberry flavors coat your tongue.  The alcohol is noticeable, but it carries so much flavor along with it that it comes off as decently balanced."
Italy,92.0,115.0,Barolo,Michele Chiarlo,"Subtle aromas of dark berry, espresso, exotic spice and French oak slowly take shape on this. The firmly structured palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, coffee and licorice while close-grained tannins provide an assertive backbone. Drink 2023??033."
US,91.0,33.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Apex,"Aromatically reticent initially it opens to reveal notes of herbs, coffee, plum and barrel spices. It's elegantly styled with silky cherry flavors and soft tannins that lead to a drawn out finish."
US,80.0,15.0,Virginia,Stanburn,"On the sweet side, this offers a soft texture, a slightly bitter edge and a pruny fruit flavor."
US,93.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Lost Blues,"Savory pepper and raw-beef notes mark on the nose of this tightly wound bottling, as well as nut brittle and teriyaki aromas. Plum skins, lavender and carpaccio show on the sip alongside a wash of flowers and herbs, from lavender to rosemary. The tannins are mouthcoating and need time to develop. Drink 2018??028."
US,90.0,40.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"Voluptuously lush and creamy, this is thick in vanilla swirls and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, with full-bodied concentration of baked apple. Rich and round, it finishes in a yeasty tone of brioche."
US,91.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Ken Wright,"Ken Wright produces as many as a dozen or more single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine is blended from many of those same sites, whose vines were often planted back in the 1980s. It's light and elegant, yet powerfully flavorful, with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit pushing deep into the palate. It's clean and fresh, with crisp defining acidity, perfect balance, refined tannins and a long finish. Best of all, it's widely available."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Chianti Classico,Tolaini,"Truffle, ripe berry, plum, oak-driven spice, espresso and leather aromas lead the nose. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and tobacco alongside tightly knit tannins. It closes on a note of grilled herb. Drink 2016??021."
France,87.0,21.0,CÃ´tes de Bourg,Closerie du Bailli,"Smooth and balanced, this wine brings together generous red fruits and fresh acidity. Underneath, attractive, dry tannins give shape to this otherwise ready-to-drink, fruity wine. It's is a generous blend of 60% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec."
Spain,84.0,10.0,Ribera del Duero,R+,"Burnt smelling like charred steak, this also offers raw oak scents along with boysenberry aromas. A dense, pounding, tannic palate holds blackened, peppery flavors of blackberry. A smoky finish smolders with peppery spice and hard tannins."
US,85.0,16.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"Lemony fresh with touches of mineral and earth, this easy-quaffing wine conveys subtle flavors of apple, pear and lemon. Dry in style, the expansive, full-bodied mouthfeel is cut by brisk, lemony acidity."
US,91.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"The Peju style is of soft, ripe voluptuousness, making this the kind of wine that's enormously attractive to drink now. This '11 Syrah is immediately appealing for its raspberry, cherry and oak flavors, but it's the mouthfeel that's special. With modest alcohol, it feels smooth, silky and clean. Drink now."
US,82.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Wilson,"The official alcohol is only 14.6%, not all that high, but the wine has a hot, Porty mouthfeel. It also tastes of overripe raisins, and finishes with a burning, chili pepper quality."
US,88.0,36.0,Paso Robles,Adelaida,"There are tons of rich, ripe flavors in this soft, high-alcohol California rendition of ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape. Based on MourvÃ¨dre and Grenache, it offers a blast of sweet cherry jam, blackberry, creamy mocha and spice."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico,Monte Schiavo,"This wine opens with sensations of yellow spring flowers and a whiff of citrus. The linear palate offers lemon zest and tart apple flavors, framed by racy acidity. Siena Imports, L'Amore di Vino."
US,94.0,64.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"Stark minerality, from hot gravel to chipped slate, meets with garrigue elements of lavender and thyme on the nose of this strong bottling that gains a savory quality thanks to roasted-pork aromas. The requisite fruit arrives on the sip, where smashed cranberry meets with pepper spice and dried herbs. The structure is grippy and affords great length in the finish."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Barbera d'Asti,Coppo,"Barbera d'Asti L'Avvocata opens with tart aromas of small berry and white cherry with a touch of pungent smoke or burnt toast. Light in color and consistency, the wine closes with a crisp, sharp finish."
US,87.0,15.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The Horse Heaven Vineyard adds a welcome touch of minerality to the plain apple fruit flavor of the wine. It is this minerality that elevates it a notch, giving it a textural and refreshing mouthfeel."
Italy,89.0,200.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Tedeschi,"This Amarone has scents of plum, raisin and toasted oak. The palate delivers prune and black cherry flavors, accented by hints of chocolate. This is soft and round, and the palate is also somewhat evolved."
US,86.0,18.0,Northern Sonoma,Rodney Strong,"Alexander and Russian River Valley fruit contributed to this dry wine, which is distinctively Zinfandel in its wild briary aromas and flavors. There's a peppery note, and it's bone-dry. It's the perfect wine for the barbecue or the tailgate party.  ?S.H."
Argentina,87.0,29.0,Uco Valley,Finca Don Carlos,"Murky aromas of herbal black fruits and coffee grinds are funky. A scattered mouthfeel and herbal, spotty flavors of plum and currant finish briny. Overall, this is interesting and good but odd, with can't-miss herbal notes."
US,86.0,10.0,Finger Lakes,Glenora,"While this wine is labeled ""dry,"" it's technically not. There's some sugar left in it, it just seems dry if you compare it to the winery's regular, semi-dry version. Aromas of spiced pears and musky, evening flowers blend with flavors of pears, peaches and dried spices."
US,92.0,16.0,Lodi,Uvaggio,"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish."
France,85.0,16.0,Bordeaux,Donjon de Bruignac,"With considerable acidity, this wine shows as much black currant fruitiness as it does structure. Fruit on the palate is accented with just a touch of toast and light tannins. This is an attractive wine for early drinking."
Italy,88.0,54.0,Recioto della Valpolicella Classico,Santa Sofia,"This presents sweet notes of berry fruit, cinnamon and crushed clove that are backed by firm structure and polished tannins. The finish is generous, with a cool cherry flavor."
US,87.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,"The 14 Hands Cabernet has more grip and authority than the Hot To Trot Red, but perhaps less immediate appeal. Black cherry and fig fruit are swathed in chocolate malt flavors, with a wash of mocha setting up the finish. Take your pick; either of these reds is sure to please."
US,87.0,24.0,Middleburg,Three Fox,"Fragrant and floral on the nose, this 100% Sangiovese rosÃ© shows interesting notes of rose water and pink grapefruit on the nose. Tart peach and watermelon are bright on the deftly textured palate and linger toward a fuzzy tannin finish."
Spain,87.0,14.0,Rioja,Bodegas OntaÃ±Ã³n,"Gritty, tarry plum and raspberry aromas are firm and good. This feels wide, fleshy and tomatoey. Plum, raspberry and currant flavors turn more oaky and toasty as they open, while the finish is lightly herbal and peppery in flavor, with zesty acidity."
US,90.0,45.0,Marin County,Sean Thackrey,"An eccentric wine. Rather heavy for a classic coastal Pinot Noir, yet not without charismatic charm. Shows rich, deep flavors of wild raspberries, toffee, vanilla bean and smoky wood. Gathers momentum and interest as it breathes in the glass. Could substitute for everything from Zinfandel to Grenache. Drink now."
Spain,90.0,33.0,Rioja,CVNE,"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish."
US,88.0,105.0,Napa Valley,Jarvis,"This is a 100% varietal wine grown entirely on the producer's estate. Aged nearly two years in all-new French Nevers oak, it shows a tinge of smoke?campfire nearly?from the barrel, followed by a reduced expression of blueberry and herbes de Provence. Firm, integrated tannins don't distract."
US,90.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Longboard,"An impressive Syrah, showing a good structure of acids and tannins and considerable complexity. Offers layers of blackberries, charred meat, moo shu plum sauce and exotic, peppery spices, wrapped into firm but finely-ground tannins. Drink over the next six years."
France,84.0,10.0,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,"There is a layer of tannins here that impart a dry edge to what is otherwise sweetly fruity wine. It is full and juicy, with strawberry fruit flavors."
Spain,82.0,14.0,Rioja,Bodegas TobÃ­a,"Candied cherry and strawberry aromas are soft, artificial and not convincing. Jammy on the palate, this tastes dull, with a touch of raspberry fruit. Bitter notes and latex dominate a flat finish."
Italy,89.0,59.0,Alto Adige,Caldaro,"Ripe wild berry, dark spice and a whiff of leather unfold in the glass while the solid palate offers up stewed prune, vanilla and roasted coffee bean. Chewy tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2017."
US,81.0,8.0,California,Round Hill,"Sweet in fruit and oak, with simple, candied flavors of pineapple jam and vanilla custard."
US,81.0,11.0,Lodi,Harlow Ridge,"A very basic Cabernet Sauvignon, very low in alcohol, with a harshness on the finish."
Spain,84.0,12.0,Ribera del Duero,Condado de Oriza,"Red-fruit and citrus aromas create an astringent sensation on the nose. In the mouth, this is rather dilute and wiry in feel. Flavors of cranberry, pie cherry and orange peel finish herbal and lean."
Australia,87.0,14.0,Adelaide,Shoofly,"Melon and pineapple fruit flavors offer something a little different from other white varieties, and while the wine is full and round in the mouth, it remains focused on the finish, a touch of honey balanced by citrusy notes. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Brunelli Martoccia,"Eucalyptus, forest floor, new leather and dark spice aromas swirl around in the glass. The full-bodied forward palate is already approaching its peak drinking window, offering dried black cherry and star anise alongside soft acidity and solid tannins. Drink through 2022."
US,85.0,25.0,McMinnville,Yamhill Valley,"Crunchy and somewhat bitter, this has tight citrus rind flavors and a whiff of vanilla. A small percentage of the blend spent a bit of time in neutral oak."
US,93.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Flora Springs,"With a sweet core of cherry fruit, plenty of tobacco and coffee nuances and other fine touches, this meritage blend hits the right chords and shows just the right weight. Deep, handsome, and fairly seamless; some light oak is applied skillfully, and in general the final product sings a pretty song."
US,89.0,14.0,Columbia Gorge (OR),Viento,"This single-vineyard blend includes Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc Musque, from a one-acre site in the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's labeled as a field blend, which suggests that the grapes were co-fermented; the results are harmonious and quite appealing. The mix of crisp citrus and tart pear fruit is set against flinty acids that set up the taste buds for chÃ¨vre or light seafood."
France,87.0,16.0,Marcillac,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"Marcillac is a tiny appellation tucked away in the France's elevated Massif Central region. Made from the local grape Mansois (also known as Fer Servadou or Braucol in neighboring Gaillac), this wine is finely perfumed and ripe with berry fruits. With a cool, tannic structure, the wine is firm while fruity. It is not going to take long to be ready to drink, so just wait until the end of 2016."
Italy,87.0,8.0,Moscato d'Asti,La Gironda di Galandrino,"This bright Moscato d'Asti delivers pure expressions of both the fragrant Moscato grape and the special territory in northern Italy that shaped this delicate dessert wine. Floral aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine are presented in a compact, elegant manner thanks to the temperate growing conditions in Piedmont. The finish is creamy, frothy and rich."
Spain,83.0,20.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,"Tire rubber, heat and funky, oak-based spice aromas are ominous and foretelling. The palate on this Garnacha is creamy and feels sticky, while the flavors are sugary and emphasize vanilla and marshmallow over clean fruit. Flaccid on the finish, with candied flavors."
Italy,91.0,15.0,Romagna,Tre Monti,"Savory and intriguing, this opens with heady scents suggesting ripe apricot, honeydew melon and Spanish broom. The round enveloping palate doles out juicy peach, ripe pear, bitter almond and a hint of honey. Mouthwatering acidity and a blast of tangerine give it a mouthwatering close."
US,90.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Lucie,"Ripely delicious and jammy with raspberries, red cherries, and sweet-buttered-toast notes, this Pinot is great for drinking now with steak or lamb chops. With a crisp edge of acidity, it's as elegant and tasty as Russian River Pinot gets."
US,90.0,18.0,Umpqua Valley,Abacela,"This is definitely sweet, with 30 g/L residual sugar, but that is counterbalanced with enough natural acidity to keep it lively and just outside the dessert wine category. The aromatics show plenty of Muscat's lush orange blossom and fruit character, with a concentrated palate and penetrating finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Amity,"Union Wine Company, which now owns Amity, makes a number of good-value, well-structured Pinots. Add this one to the list. Aged 11 months in 15% new French oak, it's pleasingly fruity (raspberry and cherry) but doesn't stop there. The touch of barrel-aging adds coffee and caramel highlights."
US,90.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Forgeron,"This lightly colored wine displays high-toned aromas of dried herbs, dried flowers, cranberries and cherries. The flavors show a pleasing mixture of concentration and restraint with the Petit Verdot blended in (10%) adding some heft and dryness to the tannins."
US,93.0,48.0,Yakima Valley,Sparkman,"The sister wine to Ruby Leigh, this Cabernet-based blend is sourced principally from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens with scents of violets and moves into a firm palate mixing cassis, herb and iron shavings. Excellent structure cellaring through 2025."
US,94.0,120.0,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,CaptÃ»re,"Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8??0 years, if not longer."
Italy,87.0,48.0,Barbaresco,Prinsi,"Aromas suggesting dark berry, exotic spice and toasted oak come together in this. The tight palate is more subdued than the nose, recalling sour berry and powdered herbs alongside astringent tannins."
US,90.0,22.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Stolpman,"An exotic but compelling wine that allows Viognier a full expression of its personality, but reins it in with dry elegance. The tropical fruit, nectarine, white flower, honey and vanilla flavors are pure Viognier, yet the wine never loses its structural integrity and minerality. Great value at this price."
US,91.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after."
France,88.0,15.0,Coteaux Varois en Provence,Gassier,"The small enclave of Coteaux Varois produces lighter wines than CÃ´tes de Provence. This fresh and smooth wine is typical, with an attractive poise that comes from ripe strawberry flavors and the lightest acidity. It's real apÃ©ritif style of wine."
US,86.0,22.0,Santa Barbara County,Consilience,"Dried and sour red and purple fruit aromas lead the nose on this wine, with accents of plums and Hawaiian li hing mui powder. The palate is more sour than anything, with bitter coffee, plum skins and tart cherries most readily apparent."
France,90.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du Marmandais,Cave du Marmandais,"The vineyards of Marmande are on the north bank of the Garonne River, east of Bordeaux. This wine, produced by the cooperative from a single vineyard, is dense, concentrated and full of both fine fruit and tannins. It has juicy black fruits that are sustained by the dusty texture. The aftertaste with its acidity is fresh and fruity. Drink from 2018."
US,90.0,180.0,Napa Valley,Caymus,"Brawny tannins meet mild acidity in this powerful, rich wine that's full-bodied and decadent. Chocolate, mocha and caramel notes are etched into its soft, rounded layers of generous red fruit."
US,89.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Robert Hall,"This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot, 20% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec shows umami-driven notes of beef char and campfire on the fairly tight nose, along with condensed violets and black cherry. Grippy tannins contain the palate, where layers of herbs, black fruits, asphalt, roast-beef char and blueberry pie show strongly."
US,88.0,25.0,Monticello,Lovingston,"A Merlot-based blend with 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers forward aromas of dark cherry, blueberry compote and blackberry, which are offset by notes of pastry spice, char and tobacco. Medium- to full-bodied, it offers ripe, integrated tannins and lush acids that lend the palate a velvety texture."
France,91.0,72.0,Condrieu,Les Vins de Vienne,"This wine has typical Condrieu aromas and flavors of honey, apricot and white pepper, all carried by a fairly full-bodied, slightly oily palate. It's a rich wine, with lingering spice on the finish."
US,92.0,52.0,South Coast,Carter Estate,"Well-integrated aromas of dried mint and black cherry meet with baking spice, cappuccino and dried-beef notes on the nose of this bottling. Dried cherry, smoked beef, bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors show on the sip, where a solid tannic structure and good density ensures a long life for this wine."
Spain,91.0,25.0,Priorat,Mas Igneus,"This is deep and fruity up front, with blackberry and cola aromas that come with creamy oak and offsetting minerality. Full and jammy on the palate, with flavors of blackberry, fine herbs and lightly applied molasses. Round and concentrated on the finish. Drink now through 2016."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Salento,Masseria Altemura,"Made from Negroamaro, this coppery, peach-hued rosÃ© is rather weighty, with flavors that run toward cherries and chocolate. You could serve it with rich seafood dishes, but it can also stand up to grilled beef."
US,90.0,45.0,Santa Maria Valley,Testarossa,"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime."
US,90.0,37.0,Willamette Valley,Antiquum Farm,"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new."
US,95.0,68.0,Ribbon Ridge,Brick House,"Evelyn's is the winery's reserve bottling. From first sniff to last sip it's a magical wine, conveying the richness and complexity that Biodynamic farming can convey. Cherries, cut tobacco, iron filings and dark chocolate flavors swirl together in a lush tapestry. The texture, tension and balance are superb, and time spent in 50% new French oak puts a wisp of smoke through the engaging finish."
US,92.0,50.0,Central Coast,Clos La Chance,"Ripe and powerful in blackberry, cherry, cassis and sweet oak flavors, with a spicy finish, this blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, also is potent in tannins. It's a complex, nuanced wine, but is really too astringent for current consumption. Give it at least six years and try again."
France,87.0,12.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,ChÃ¢teau de l'HyverniÃ¨re,"Light, fresh style, demanding shellfish, with crisp, green acidity and just a hint of creamy baked apple. Just what a Muscadet should be, enjoyable now and for the rest of the year."
US,85.0,18.0,Amador County,Folie Ã  Deux,"A good, everyday sort of Zin, dry and fruity. It has a rich tannic structure, with spicy cherry, tangerine, currant, cola and cocoa flavors."
Australia,84.0,22.0,Yarra Valley,Sibling Rivalry,"Lightweight but amply wooded, this is an earthy wine tinged with cedar, mocha and campfire smoke. Drink up."
US,84.0,22.0,Central Coast,Barton,"A blend of Grenache Blanc, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc, this white wine has sugary orange and apricot flavors. Brisk acidity fortunately provides some balance, but It's almost as sweet as a dessert wine."
Spain,85.0,15.0,Navarra,Ochoa,"Floral aromas and tropical scents are a touch heavy and oily. This blend of Viura and Chardonnay is citrusy in the mouth, with little variation on that theme. Tangerine, orange and tart nectarine flavors finish bright and juicy."
US,88.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Sheldrake Point,"A vein of burnt sugar threads curiously from nose to finish in this dry full-bodied Pinot Gris. Sunny tangerine, pineapple and apricot flavors flood the midpalate, brightened by streak of lime acidity. A graceful balance of brawn and restraint, it should drink well through 2021."
Italy,88.0,56.0,Barolo,Anna Maria Abbona,"This earthy Barolo has funky sensations of game, meat juices, oak, vanilla, spice and ripe black berry fruit. The warm midpalate and sweet fruit are balanced by tightly packed, astringent tannins that leave the mouth feeling dry. Drink after 2020."
US,86.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Standing Stone,"Warm whiffs of cinnamon and brioche accent aromas of black cherry and plum on this plush, fruit-forward Saperavi. Plummy and soft with black-fruit flavor, it's a straightforward, yet tasty wine. Finishes with a fringe of fine, delicate tannins."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Barolo,Giacomo Ascheri,"Be careful when you look for thense wines, the labels at Aschieri are a little confusing;  a small white strip label at thumb level distinguishes the Sorano ordinaire from the special Costa Bricco. The wine, itself, is thick and quite poerful, with very ripe dark fruit, roses and earth flavors. It is beginning to show its age, and did not seem quite as fresh as the Sorano, but it proved to be more intense and extracted."
US,90.0,17.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pech Merle,"Made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc fermented and aged in stainless steel tanks, this wine shows why Dry Creek Valley has achieved such a fine reputation with this variety. Totally dry and brisk in acidity, it has savory flavors of lemons and limes, passionfruit, gooseberries and white pepper. Awesome with Vietnamese, Ethiopian and Indian fare calling for white wine."
US,88.0,35.0,Sonoma Coast,Alma Fria,"This light, lean beauty is a blend of three vineyards in the appellation, including two that are vineyard-designated by the producer in other wines. It highlights wild strawberry, blueberry and forest floor, all fresh, bright and velvety on the palate. The finish offers a taste of oak."
France,84.0,45.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau FrÃ©dignac,"This is a juicy wine with fresh acidity and red berry flavors. It is bright with fruits although also with a dry core. The juiciness should develop, so drink from 2017. Vincent and Ludivine l'Amouller, the estate's fourth generation, began converting the vineyard to certified organic in 2010."
US,83.0,18.0,New Mexico,VivÃ¡c Winery,"A blend of 85% Merlot, 10% Syrah, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has an oxidative aroma that overrides the scents of cassis, blackberry, spiced mocha and vanilla. The medium-bodied palate feels soft and malleable, and it comes with a raisin-like edge. Finishes a bit short."
US,81.0,10.0,California,Stonehedge,"Dark and earthy, a thick, heavy wine with plummy, chocolatey flavors and big tannins, although the acidity is soft. The main drawback is residual sugar. Once that sugar hits, the palate is discombobulated."
Argentina,83.0,12.0,CalchaquÃ­ Valley,Michel Torino,"A fleshy wine with aromas of wet clay and earth. It seems a little hot and herbal at its foundation, but around the edges there are flavors of cherry and raspberry. The feel is chunky and innocuous, with mild tannins."
US,88.0,53.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"Mostly Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend is aromatically thick and heavy with vanilla, pipe tobacco and cherry fruit components. It's a big wine, with ripe tannins and a streak of cola. More bottle age may help to soften the aggressive new-oak flavors."
US,91.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Row Eleven,"This likable wine has juicy and bright core, a mix of spicy cola-cherry and forest floor nested in firm, integrated tannins that works seamlessly on the palate. A full-bodied wine, it has power and grace."
Italy,94.0,40.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,"Stunning and sophisticated, it leads with intense aromas of elder flowers, tropical fruit, spice and hay. The structured but elegant palate delivers creamy peach, melon, and exotic fruit accented with notes of spice and energizing mineral purity alongside vibrant acidity. Throughout, it shows impeccable balance and depth."
France,91.0,50.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Cantinot,"From 7.5 acres of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a rich wine, very perfumed and with layers of ripe fruit. It is lightly structured, full of red berries with a firm tannic character in the background. Under winemaker Olivier Dauga, the wine needs to age but has all the fruit potential there. Drink from 2018."
US,80.0,18.0,North Fork of Long Island,Laurel Lake,"Vanilla, butterscotch and some harsher oak-derived compounds dominate the modest citrus fruit that might have been wine before it was turned into oak juice. For wood lovers only."
US,94.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Justin,"Lush and lavish in all the right ways, this blend of 70% Syrah, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Petite Sirah shows vanilla cream, clove chiffon and blueberry pudding on the nose. The palate packs more blueberry fruit as well as black pepper, graphite, espresso bean and toasted sage, all framed by a solid structure of tooth-coating tannins."
US,86.0,8.0,California,Kenwood,"A versatile white wine, made from Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, and showing aspects of both. It's rich in creamy oranges, peaches, lemons and limes, brightened with crisp, citrusy acidity."
France,93.0,128.0,Gevrey-Chambertin,Domaine RenÃ© Bouvier,"This firm wine has structure as well as enticing sweet red berry fruits. Dynamic and fruity, it has a dark structure that impressively expresses this solid terroir. Drink from 2018."
US,90.0,46.0,Russian River Valley,MacRostie,"Light in color and nuanced in oak, this full-bodied beauty doesn't hold back on richness, allowing plenty of room for an expanse of salted caramel, pineapple and preserved lemon. Layered and robust throughout the midpalate, it lightens up on the intensity through a crisp finish."
France,88.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Georges Duboeuf,"With rich fruits, this is a ripe and full-bodied wine. With ease and concentration, it handles considerable youthful acidity plus berry fruits and structure. It should be fully integrated by the beginning of 2015."
US,86.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Silverado,"You'll find a rich vein of cherries, red currants and cedar, leading to a dry, spicy finish, but the velvety smoothness you want in a fine Merlot is what it lacks."
France,88.0,12.0,Bordeaux,SchrÃ¶der & SchÃ¿ler,"Ripe and juicy, this wine melds red berry and black currant flavors easily into its dry texture. A deliciously ripe wine, it feels soft and forward; it will likely be ready to drink in six months."
Argentina,89.0,23.0,Mendoza,Budeguer,"Aromas of raspberry, blackberry, green herbs and tar set up a blocky, jammy, chunky palate. Plum, raspberry, currant, pepper and oaky flavors are grainy and spicy, while a woody finish tastes resiny, chocolaty and toasty."
Italy,84.0,13.0,Chianti Colli Fiorentini,Lanciola,"This informal red opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, wet soil and dark plum. The simple palate offers up tart cherry, black raspberry and an earthy note of game alongside brisk acidity. Angular but fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish. Drink now."
US,91.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,McGregor,"Complexity abounds on this spicy cedar-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe red-plum and cherry flavors are juicy and plush yet balanced briskly by sharp edges of acidity and graphite. It's intensely earthy, studded with notes of bramble and autumn leaf. Fine feathery tannins lead a long lingering finish."
US,89.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Mi SueÃ±o,"This 100% Syrah is drinking so lush and opulent now, it's hard to see it developing any further. The fruit is from Coombsville vineyards, and the wine shows a brisk tannin-acid structure framing ripe flavors of cherries, currants, mocha and sweet new oak. Drink now??016."
US,84.0,22.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Carr,"Grown in the Happy Canyon section of eastern Santa Ynez, an area that one of these days will be an official appellation. It's warm back in that canyon, and this Sangiovese is sugary in sweet berries and cherries. Has nothing in common at all with Italian Sangiovese."
US,92.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Zotovich Cellars,"Everything about this Syrah works. It's dry, crisp in acidity, elegantly tannic and, above all, superbly drinkable, with subtle but powerful cherry, currant, cola, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Feels delicious and important, with a bit more weight than a Pinot Noir."
US,88.0,33.0,Russian River Valley,Acorn,"The cherry, red currant and smoky oak flavors on this wine are delicious, and with the light, silky texture and vibrant acidity, you might think it was Pinot Noir. Beautiful to drink now with your favorite Italian-inspired beef entrÃ©e, but stay away from tomatoes."
US,91.0,39.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"A brilliant Chardonnay, brimming with powerfully ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors, enriched with smoky, sweet oak. The key here is acidity and the minerality that accompanies the best Santa Lucia Chards. Drink this flamboyant wine now for maximum vibrancy."
US,91.0,32.0,San Luis Obispo,Last Summer,"The extreme youth of this stylishly packaged wine is on full display, with exuberant notes of crushed cranberry, raspberry, Earl Grey tea and rosewater on the nose. Lively acidity on the sip carries flavors of dried red fruit and touches of leather and tobacco. It's almost soda pop-like, and would go great with a slight chill on a warm day near the water."
France,88.0,22.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Domaine Dominique Pabiot,"Based in the village of Les Loges, close to the Loire, this producer has made a light, fruity style of wine. It is crisp with citrus, bright acidity and only the hint of a more mineral texture. It can be drunk now for its fruitiness."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Toro,Damalisco,"Spicy oak aromas accent foxy red berry scents in this pinchy, wayward wine. Its chocolatey black fruit and peppery spice flavors finish jammy, with a lot of unresolved oak."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,"Milk chocolate, toast and raspberry aromas are followed by quite sweet fruit flavors. It's unabashed in its easy-drinking appeal."
France,89.0,65.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Aromas of ripe yellow fruits announce a wine that has rich fruit flavors of apricots touched by pineapple. It does have the attractive, nervy texture of 2008, along with an important layer of toast."
Spain,94.0,45.0,Ribera del Duero,Telmo RodrÃ­guez,"Everything about this wine is singing in harmony. The nose is fresh and pure, with raspberry, plum, spice and youthful rubbery aromas. The palate is elegant and impeccably balanced, while flavors of vanilla and coconut announce ample oak, with toasty, peppery plum and raspberry flavors waiting in the wings. Power, precision and elegance are draped all over the finish. Best from 2017 through 2025."
US,87.0,20.0,California,South Coast,"From Silva Spoon Vineyards in Lodi, this uncommon California bottling of a common Portuguese white grape offers candied apple, mango, peach and papaya aromas on the lush and tropical nose. The palate, however, is crisp and dry, its honeydew melon and bubblegum flavors proving rather pleasant."
US,87.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Silver Thread,"The faintest waft of marshmallow lends a pleasantly confectionery note to stone-fruit and blossom aromas on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is elegant with brisk herbal tones and zesty lime acidity."
US,88.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Fritz,"Lots of ripe pineapple, peach and tropical fruit flavors in this Chard, as well as a nice hit of sweet, smoky oak, with a honeyed finish. It's certainly rich, but the acidity is strong."
US,88.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Curran,"An elegant wine, silky and supple, for drinking now with umami-rich fare, like ham or sausages, or a spicy lamb stew. Fully dry, it shows good acidity firming up the cherry, cola and herb flavors."
US,90.0,30.0,Rutherford,Trinchero,"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012."
France,94.0,30.0,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,"There is something pleasantly bitter on the nose: Burnt sugar or bitter almond. The palate answers this with fluid, rippling sweetness expressed in ripe, juicy, refreshing pear fruit. The bitter notes remain and create an appetizing, tangy edge to this concentrated wine that is streamlined by balancing freshness despite the residual sugar. A lovely balancing act with a bracingly clean, medium dry finish and echoes of citrus zest. Drink 2017??035."
US,88.0,28.0,Rogue Valley,Weisinger,"This pure Malbec from a single vineyard offers deep boysenberry fruit flavors, along with cassis, coffee and dark chocolate. It shows an effective balance between fruit and barrel flavors."
US,88.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Longboard,"Ripe, jammy pineapple, Meyer lemon and nectarine flavors characterize this Chardonnay. It also shows plenty of new oak and lees notes. Rich and flashy, it's fully ready to drink now."
US,91.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Fuse,"An exotic Cabernet at a great price. Shows classically ripe Napa fruit and tannins, a big, full-bodied and dramatic wine with blackberry and black currant flavors. The addition of 25% Syrah adds a peppery, teriaki beef spiciness and meatiness that's most welcome. Now??014."
US,83.0,31.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Holmes Harbor Cellars,"Sugary and astringent, the unusual mix of flavors includes bark, brown sugar and grain. Nothing jells."
France,86.0,19.0,Alsace,Leon Beyer,"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon."
US,92.0,50.0,Dry Creek Valley,Gary Farrell,"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender. Medium in body and acidity, it works for the table, finding balance as it goes, before a rich taste of toffee finishes things off."
US,94.0,225.0,Oakville,The Vineyard House,"This is a structured, substantial wine, grippy on the palate, with firm-grained tannin and smoky oak. Mouth-filling with a juicy sophisticated core of cherry, blackberry and black currant, there's a defiant meatiness to the fruit, spiked in clove, black pepper and tobacco. Cellar through 2033."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Friuli Grave,Pitars,This has a smooth structure and yellow fruit aromas. This wine also adds a grassy twist of dried herb or rosemary on the finish.
France,94.0,60.0,Champagne,Deutz,"This wine, though still young, reveals much about the Deutz style as well as the vintage. It strikes a balance between softness and crispness that fits the ethos of the house. At the same time, it's an attractive medium-term bottling, in line with what many producers acheived in 2010. It should be kept until 2019."
Spain,92.0,40.0,Pago de ArÃ­nzano,ArÃ­nzano,"Plum, currant and spice aromas are cool and lightly herbal. A bright, juicy palate delivers robust berry, plum and spice flavors. Dry, complex and harmonious on the finish, this is a shining example from a tough vintage. Drink this blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Merlot through 2020."
Spain,92.0,25.0,Toro,Teso La Monja,"With its inky black color and intense, dense aromas of black fruits, leather, spice and herbs, Almirez is a poster child for Toro. The palate is firm but offers cushion, while flavors of toast, wood, roasted berry, cassis and licorice finish long, wild and leathery. Drink through 2019."
US,93.0,75.0,Stags Leap District,S. Anderson,"Deep earth, tobacco and dark plums on the nose, and a lovely cool note. Dark fruit on the palate keeps that cool profile going. The flavorful finish rolls on and on, not missing a beat, with beautiful black fruit and espresso notes. An appealing black beauty, best after three years and out through 2010."
Australia,87.0,18.0,Mornington Peninsula,T'Gallant,"Seems almost Burgundian in this crowd, with its aromas of smoke and white peach and flavors of roasted hazelnuts and grilled peaches. Finishes clean and crisp, with tart, lime-like acidity and hints of smoke."
US,84.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Mosby,"This California bottling of an Italian varietal is rustic, with flavors suggesting cherry pie filling. This should pair with burgers and similar fare."
US,87.0,18.0,North Fork of Long Island,Jamesport,"The scent of apple blossoms perfume this round, richly structured wine, accentuating flavors of apple and pear on the palate. Touches of vanilla and cream add weight and mouthfeel, but the wine finishes crisp with lemony acidity and saline minerality."
US,94.0,38.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"Coming from a block of vines called South Pointe that are planted closest to the vineyard's creek, this wine shows plum and raspberry fruits on the nose along with smoked licorice and black slate. It's ripe in raspberry flavor at the tip of the sip, but then clings to a restrained line of graphite and peppery, acidic spice, continuing to evolve deep into the finish."
France,84.0,14.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Dubraud,"This wine is soft and juicy with 12 months in barrel. It has rounded tannins and perfumed berry fruits. What it misses is the acidity, leaving an unbalanced wine."
Italy,95.0,105.0,Toscana,Marchesi Antinori,"Here's a structured red with lots of finesse. It opens with alluring aromas of fragrant blue flowers, red berries, baking spices and exotic herbs while the firm, vibrant palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, orange zest, licorice and a sprinkling of white pepper. It's still young but well balanced, with tightly woven but polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2017??024."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Gianni Brunelli,"Aromas of dark berry, fragrant blue flower, chopped herb and a whiff of baking spice float out of the glass. The lively enjoyable palate doles out juicy wild cherry, cranberry, thyme and a hint of anise alongside smooth, supple tannins and firm acidity."
France,90.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Mathilde Chapoutier SÃ©lection,"This is the third release of the rosÃ© produced by Mathilde Chapoutier, whose father, Michel, runs the famed Hermitage-based M. Chapoutier. It is a light-colored wine, a typical Provence blend with the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon. Fruity and with great acidity, it is light in texture, just hinting at minerality. Drink now."
US,85.0,22.0,California,Reyes,"A curious rosÃ© that relies on a touch of Tempranillo to color the Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Symphony grapes, this shows sour orange and light plum on the nose. Dried strawberry and orange rind appear on the sip, which is framed by decent acidity and light tannins."
US,87.0,19.0,Finger Lakes,Heron Hill,"Juicy and ripe, yet briskly composed, this medium-bodied Pinot Noir boasts flavors of red cherry and strawberry preserves offset by crisp cranberry acidity. It's concentrated on the palate but finishes swiftly with just a feathery hint of tannins."
France,87.0,23.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"From vines grown below the Roche de SolutrÃ© cliff, this is a tight wine with a mineral texture and steely acidity. The structure will soften to give a wine that is full and concentrated, with plenty of acidity as well as citrus flavors. Wait until 2017."
US,91.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Matthews Estate,"An interesting Syrah, this weaves together light influences of vanilla, coffee and tea around beautifully integrated fruit flavors of citrus, blueberry and black currant. The balance is just right, and the melding of these seemingly disparate flavors is handled perfectly."
France,88.0,15.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Chateau de Sadran,"The wine is dry and firm with solid tannins as well as blackberry fruit. It is structured, balanced by juicy acidity and oak-aging flavors. The wine comes from the slopes of the CÃ´tes de Bordeaux about the small town of Cadillac."
Italy,93.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,San Giacomo,"Full bodied and balanced, this conveys aromas of menthol, underbrush, savory herb, fennel, tilled soil and leather. The vibrant palate offers bright red cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, grilled herb, anise and a balsamic note alongside tightly knit but poised tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018??025."
France,82.0,20.0,Vin Mousseux,Charles de FÃ¨re,"Made from Loire Valley fruit, this is a soft rosÃ©?the word Dry indicates it is off-dry rather than Brut. It has sweetened strawberry juice and a jammy character, with little in the way of acidity."
Italy,88.0,42.0,Barbera d'Alba,Sandrone,"Aromas of leafy forest floor, damp soil, espresso, dark berry and chopped herbs lead the way. The racy palate delivers raspberry, tart cranberry and powdered sage alongside a backbone of electrifying acidity and fine-grained tannins."
US,86.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Rodney Strong,"Does a good job at expressing ripe, cool-climate Chardonnay character at a fair price. Creamy and smooth, it shows peach, pear, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, with a spicy finish."
US,83.0,7.0,California,Coyote Creek,"With lots of residual sugar, this white Zin is so sweet, it's almost a dessert wine. The sweetness makes the raspberries and cherries taste like candy."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Rosso di Montalcino,San Polo,"This fresh expression of Sangiovese Grosso offers tight berry aromas, with shades of spice and toasted almond in the background. Bright acidity brings up the rear."
US,90.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Liberty Lake,"The aromas of cocoa, raspberry, black tea, vanilla and cranberry are in full bloom. The cranberry and cherry flavors are ripe and full, backed by firm tannins. This wine is in a sweet spot. Drink now."
US,92.0,15.0,California,Terre Rouge,"Dark and sexy; there's something erotic about this wine, with its seductive jammy flavors, velvety texture and spicy, long finish. After an initial bite of acidity, it turns soft as a goose-down pillow. In its own way, it's perfect. And the price is unreal. Best Buy."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Alto Adige,Erste Neue,"Aromas of violet, wild strawberry and red raspberry carry through to the palate alongside hints of tea and rosemary. It's balanced and approachable with silky tannins and fresh acidity."
US,86.0,30.0,Washington,Almquist,This variety is a relative newcomer to the state. It intrigues with aromas of citrus and flowers that are followed by smoky flavors with a cranberry and flower-filled finish.
US,89.0,23.0,Temecula Valley,Falkner,"This is a very peachy and fruit-forward take on the grape from Southern California. It's happily bright and tight on the palate, with chalkiness in the midpalate, and a tropical sense throughout, with banana and pineapple building towards a lemony and layered finish."
Australia,87.0,29.0,Adelaide Hills,Mr. Riggs,"This medium-bodied wine offers an elegant, silky mouthfeel. Some yeasty-dough aromas add interest to the pineapple and tangerine flavors, which linger delicately on the finish."
US,90.0,48.0,Santa Maria Valley,Riverbench,"One of the winery's special block bottlings, this shows purple aromas of blackberry, violet and lilac alongside graphite and toasted oak. The palate is meaty, bitter and spice-driven, without much overt fruit, showing anise, pencil shavings, tar and concentrated cranberry skins."
US,89.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),DiStefano,"This appealing Bordeaux blend opens with seductive mocha and milk chocolate aromas, threaded with cedar and toast. The fruit stands up to the wood, with pretty berry and rhubarb flavors. Extra bottle age has smoothed it out."
US,90.0,75.0,Red Mountain,Rasa,"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022."
US,87.0,15.0,Yakima Valley,Kestrel,"Nice spice and strawberry fruit. The blend is a mish-mash?half Merlot, the rest Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Cab Franc, Viognier and Malbec. Not that it makes a huge difference in a rosÃ©, but it does seem a bit diffuse as a result. Nonetheless, a good sipping wine."
US,85.0,22.0,Willamette Valley,LaVelle,"Yeasty, with beery aromatics, this has slightly sweet, tangy flavors of grapefruit and soda pop. Give it more time in the bottle to meld together."
US,87.0,24.0,Napa Valley,Raymond,"Rich and forward in cherry, blackberry, coffee and smoky oak flavors, this has ripe and fine polished tannins. It's a nice wine, with some sharpness on the finish."
Canada,88.0,50.0,Niagara Peninsula,Cave Spring,"Wow, is this sweet?tooth-achingly sweet. The aromas and flavors are relatively pure and free of botrytis; instead you get boatloads of ripe pear and melon flavors, huge thickness and weight, and decent acidity. Almost too rich and sweet for its own good."
US,84.0,13.0,California,Chime,"At this price with Pinot Noir, you never know what you're going to get. Chime's track record is all over the board. With this 2012 vintage, their California Pinot Noir is average, and fairly priced. It's light and silky, with raspberry sour candy flavors."
US,93.0,64.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"Light cranberry and pomegranate show on the nose of this always-anticipated bottling by Dan Lee, with a pine-needle aroma to provide depth. The slightly sour flavor of Montmorency cherries mixes with snappy cranberry and underripe red currants on the sip, which gains herbal and peppery spice complexity as it breathes."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Catalunya,Bohigas,"Lime and grapefruit aromas are tight and come with a touch of edgy harshness. The palate shows bright acidity and is clean as a whole. Mixed citrus flavors are straightforward, and so is the finish."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Taurasi,Mastroberardino,"Underbrush, red fruit, dark spice and a whiff of menthol are some of the aromas that come together on this. The firmly structured elegant palate offers ripe plum, red cherry, licorice and tobacco framed in youthfully austere fine-grained tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2020??028."
US,87.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Blacksmith,"Coming from an assortment of warm and cool climate vineyards and blended with 6% Roussanne, this pleasing wine offers notes of grilled corn on the cob, white peach, pepper and hay. Abundant stone fruit flavors are supported by a creamy feel, finishing just a touch bitter."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau La Rose du Pin,"As the tannins soften, this wine will become rich with generous fruitiness. Blackberry flavors and acidity are developing well to give a wine that is full and will be well balanced. Drink this Ducourt family wine from 2016."
France,94.0,185.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Olivier Leflaive,"This is a domaine wine, coming from one of the vineyards owned by Olivier Leflaive and worked biodynamically. It is a very fine wine from probably the most well-known premier cru in the village. With its rich acidity and white fruits, it is generous as well as crisply textured. The toast from the wood aging adds its juicy character to this impressive wine. Drink from 2019."
US,88.0,30.0,Sonoma Valley,Robert Hunter,"Has bright, focused aromas, including lime and raspberry, with nutty, smoky bread dough and yeast. Very clean, with a pronounced kiss of sweet berry fruit. Finishes slightly sweet."
US,91.0,85.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Serene,"Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking."
US,94.0,65.0,Willamette Valley,RÃ©sonance,"The eagerly anticipated first release from Maison Louis Jadot's Oregon project does not disappoint. Long time Jadot winemaker Jacques LardiÃ¨re has put all his heart and expertise into this wine, sourced from a much-loved vineyard recently acquired by the firm. Concentrated raspberry purÃ©e comes through in both aroma and flavor, with laser focus. It's a magical combination of finesse, silkiness and strident youth, with 20 years of aging potential. Drink now through 2035."
US,89.0,26.0,Yakima Valley,Trio Vintners,"Quite delicious, and loaded with wild berry flavors and herbal highlights, this impressive wine is almost pure MourvÃ¨dre?just 4% Syrah was blended in. Twenty months in a mix of Hungarian, French and American oak has begun to soften its rather hard and slightly stemmy tannins. Further aging?up to five years?is recommended."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Mendoza,Cas'Almare,"Smells wet and salinic, with a slightly acrid note coming on late. Feels tangy, tight and zesty, with oily lime and lychee flavors. Finishes hard, nutty and mildly bitter."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Alicante,Bocopa,"Cherry and plum aromas are light, generic and clean. This feels mostly right, with moderate acidity creating a solid mouthfeel. Plum, citrus and herbal flavors finish round and balanced."
US,86.0,23.0,Monterey,La Crema,"A rusty minerality shows on the nose of this bottling alongside dried cranberry, hibiscus and an earthy streak of crushed slate. It's lightly bodied on the sip, with somewhat sweet cranberry and pomegranate-fruit flavors, lifted by clove dust."
US,84.0,13.0,Amador County,Sobon Estate,"A deep pink or coral color, strong fruit and herb aromas and equally strong, dry fruit flavors call for something rich and spicy to pair with, like sausage and mustard or pulled pork sandwiches."
France,85.0,40.0,Champagne,Ernest Rapeneau,"Soft, ripe wine, open and with a fresh mousse. It has some tightness, a nutty quality and a lime juice aftertaste."
US,88.0,53.0,Napa Valley,Envy,"A 100% varietal wine with layers of leather and bacon at the core, this full-bodied bottling is otherwise soft and juicy in red and black fruit. Overlaying it all is a smoky quality that overbears at times, but will pair well with the right foods."
US,87.0,17.0,Amador County,BorjÃ³n,"A touch of concentration helps this wine stand out from the pink pack. The color is a vibrant pink, the aromas recall watermelon and the flavors and body are hefty enough to pair well with everything from salads to salmon to fried chicken."
US,85.0,45.0,Dry Creek Valley,Williamson Wines,"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich. It is, in black cherries, black currants, mocha and oak, but it remains a tough, hard wine despite being nearly six years old. Not going anywhere."
US,87.0,14.0,Lodi,Oak Ridge,"Maple-syrup aromas and a practically syrupy texture make this full-bodied wine taste sweet, while baking spices like cinnamon and vanilla accent the deep, ripe blackberry and black-cherry flavors. It's a very tasty wine for oak lovers."
Spain,84.0,11.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Venta Morales,"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic."
US,90.0,24.0,Russian River Valley,Matrix,"A generously ripe wine with 8% Petite Sirah, this has a softly layered entry that reveals strong aromas of black olive and plum, before delving headfirst into spicy blackberry cobbler. Complex and smooth, it offers heightened acidity and a richly chocolate finish."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Barbaresco,Rivetti Massimo,"Scents of cocoa, ripe berry and a balsamic note come together on this. The jammy, straightforward palate offers dark cherry, raspberry, coffee and a hint of licorice alongside fine-grained tannins."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Sicilia,Feudo Disisa,Jammy black fruit and inky blackberry preserves open the bouquet of this syrupy red wine. The wine's texture is both dense and gritty.
Italy,87.0,14.0,Albana di Romagna,Tre Monti,"The Albana varietal is usually made into dessert wine, but this interesting rendition is vinified dry. It opens with fragrant aromas of honey, peach and apricot. A touch of subtle sweetness marks the finish."
France,90.0,75.0,Champagne,Deutz,"The palest of pinks announces the lightness of touch that makes this wine so attractive. Sure, it has ripe strawberry flavors, but they are delicate, laced with acidity, good freshness. A real apÃ©ritif wine."
Australia,91.0,20.0,McLaren Vale,Wirra Wirra,"At 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, cassis-scented wine, but one that includes hints of ripeness and generous fruit. Dried herbs and brown sugar add nuance, while the velvety finish picks up some meaty, savory notes. Drink now??025."
France,89.0,61.0,Vin de Pays du ComtÃ© Tolosan,Clos Triguedina,"Made from Chenin Blanc, harvested at night, and with a delicate botrytis edge, this is a fresh wine, reveling in honeyed acidity, with quince and honey-and-lemon flavors. It's fresh to drink now, but will certainly age."
Italy,86.0,11.0,Castel del Monte,Rivera,"There's exotic spice here that plays a supporting role to prune, plum and mature blackberry. The wine (a blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia) is simple, but generous and intense at the same time. It feels smooth and succulent in the mouth. Pair it with grilled steak and French fries."
France,84.0,13.0,Buzet,Vignerons de Buzet,"This is a fruity wine made to be drunk young. It is soft, with a blackberry stalkiness in the background as well as fresh, spicy acidity. Drink now."
US,87.0,20.0,Red Hills Lake County,Rock Wall,"Rock Wall seems to release its wines pretty young, and this too could use a little time. A blend of half Zinfandel and half Petite Sirah from the obsidian-laden hills of Lake County's Red Hills area, a very promising spot for Cabernet in particular. Still hugely tannic, this mix is yummy in dusty black fruit, leather and dark chocolate."
Spain,93.0,68.0,Toro,Pintia,"Gritty, charred aromas rest on top of core blackberry and cassis scents. This is a blocky, stout number with firm tannins and serious structure. Charred blackberry and dark chocolate are the lead flavors, while this big-boned Toro tastes of toast and mocha on the finish, which is drying and tannic. Drink through 2027."
US,92.0,60.0,Dundee Hills,Kelley Fox,"This old-vine (planted 1972) Pinot offers delicate, yet complex details throughout the palate. It's elegant winemaking at its best?a pinpoint mix of herb, stone, berry and barrel?seamless and precise. Despite (or perhaps because of?) the low alcohol, this has the potential to age; try after 2018."
US,93.0,56.0,Napa Valley,Summers,"Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015."
US,84.0,32.0,San Luis Obispo,Piedra Creek,"This is a simple, easy-drinking Pinot for drinking now. It tastes like a juicy blend of cherries, pomegranates and cola, with just enough acidity for balance."
US,85.0,27.0,Russian River Valley,Truett Hurst,"Aromas are wintery in baking spices and cinnamon stick. Flavors follow suit, awash in rich vanilla and butterscotch with a layering of ripe tropical fruit and apple."
Italy,89.0,95.0,Barolo,Viberti,"Stewed prune and cake spice aromas lead the nose along with a balsamic note. Showing the intense heat of the vintage, the warm palate offers dried cherry, raisin, powdered sage and a hint of clove alongside polished tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness."
Argentina,88.0,20.0,Mendoza,Bodega Catena Zapata,"Floral berry and plum aromas are touched up by notes of thyme and cardamom. Fresh grippy acidity keeps this lively, while flavors of berry and plum are spicy and suggestive of tomato sauce. Saucy, herbal flavors rise up on a high-acid finish."
France,92.0,20.0,Saint-Amour,Henry Fessy,"Ripe, rounded and generous, a warm plum juice-flavored wine. There is power and concentration. It is a very complete, ageworthy wine, although accessible now."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Ermacora,"This is fresh, with lush layers of peach, melon, lemon zest and white flower. It's an easy effort, boasting good structure and staying power."
US,94.0,48.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Foxen,"Ripe boysenberry, root beer and mocha latte aromas make for a dynamic, delicious nose on this bottling from Foxen's seven-acre estate vineyard. The flavors range from black pepper and roasted meats to dried thyme, sagebrush and black licorice, all set against emerging tannins and a long, lingering finish."
France,90.0,50.0,Champagne,Jacquart,"A portion of wine blended for this wine is aged for five years on lees, helping create considerable depth and richness. The youthful fruit has been replaced by almond, spice and crisp acidity, with concentration and fullness. Drink now."
Argentina,84.0,20.0,Tupungato,Domaine Bousquet,"A flat luster and mild aromas of wood and almost stale fruit get this wine off to a slow start. A full palate is sketchy in terms of acidity and balance, while this tastes cidery, with a bitter flavor of grapes skins on the finish."
US,92.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,RÃ©sonance,"Maison Louis Jadot's Willamette Valley project continues to bear fruit and has increased the production of this entry-level cuvÃ©e. A lovely, chunky mix of purple and black fruit, it's beautifully proportioned, with plenty of power, lacking only the depth of the older estate vines. It finishes on a lacy note of minerality."
US,87.0,10.0,California,Belle Ambiance,"This blends almost-sweet fruit flavors of strawberry and red cherry with savory and spicy notes, making a nicely complex and multi-dimensional, medium-bodied wine. It's smooth and fruity, with no harsh tannins."
US,85.0,14.0,Lodi,Peirano,"Made from Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier, this fruity white shows lots of complexity for the money. It's crisp and off-dry, with citrus, peach, honeysuckle and spice flavors finished with a kiss of smoky, vanilla oak."
US,94.0,48.0,Adelaida District,Alta Colina,"Roasted and raw beef, dried strawberry, crushed marjoram and salt-and-pepper seasonings show on this Syrah. Extremely dark in the glass, it's bolstered by 4% Grenache, 4% MourvÃ¨dre and 2% Viognier. Elderberry fruit kicks off the palate, following by pepper, coffee grinds, espresso beans and dark-chocolate sauce, surrounded by grippy tannins."
Australia,81.0,5.0,South Eastern Australia,Banrock Station,"This bargain-basement Australian is oddly lacking in fruit, offering up herbaceous and pine scents instead. Flavor is likewise scarce on the crisp palate and the short finish. No tannins in sight."
US,91.0,30.0,Kelsey Bench-Lake County,Prima Materia,"This wine has a big personality. It's dark in color and oozing with ripe black-cherry flavors that intermingle with a high level of tannin for that lip-smacking tooth-staining effect. So approach with caution, and then enjoy for all its boisterous impact."
Australia,91.0,37.0,McLaren Vale,Oliverhill,"Oliverhill seems to have hit the mark in 2008 with their Jimmy Section Shiraz, a seamless blend of blueberries and cream dressed up with savory notes of dark earth and dark coffee. Full-bodied and creamy textured, this densely concentrated wine should be at its best now-2020."
US,89.0,50.0,Napa County-Sonoma County,Galaxy,"A collaboration between Winemakers Elizabeth Vianna (Chimney Rock), Bryan Parker (Terlato Vineyards) and Steve Fennell (Sanford), this is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc from Napa, Chardonnay from Carneros and Viognier from Sta. Rita Hills. Golden in color, it's buttery in style, with subversive fruit that leans lemony crisp and tart on the palate."
US,88.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Panther Creek,"A blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their green farming practices, this is clean, fruity and forward. A mouth-pleasing Pinot with generously juicy and pretty cherry flavors."
US,84.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Eagle Castle,"Here's a soft, fruity Syrah that brings to mind drinking with a ham sandwich slathered with mayo. The gentle texture frames succulent flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and salty crackers."
Italy,89.0,16.0,Greco di Tufo,Colli di Castelfranci,"It opens with lovely aromas of wild flowers and stone fruit. The juicy palate offers creamy white peach, pear and apple accented with aromatic herbs and mineral alongside lively acidity."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Salento,Feudi di San Marzano,"A red blend from Salento, this bright red offers jammy notes of blackberry preserves, black cherry and prune. There's an impression of sweetness on the finish, followed by a rich, chewy mouthfeel."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,La Viarte,"Aged in stainless steel for a fresh, zesty feel, this tangy Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of peach, mature melon and Golden Delicious apple. The wine is smooth and creamy and would make a perfect match to spicy appetizers."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Collio,Eugenio Collavini,"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports."
Argentina,87.0,15.0,Valle de Uco,Zuccardi,"Wiry plum and raspberry aromas are jumpy and a touch candied. This feels bulky and grapy, with an obtuse body. Salty lightly herbal plum and berry flavors end with a touch of heat along with herbal leftovers."
Argentina,82.0,10.0,Mendoza,Hat in the Ring,"Very sweet at first, with aromas of cherry cough drop and crÃ¨me de cassis. Turns cheesy with air, and once the palate arrives be prepared for tangy pie cherry flavors in front of a starchy, lean finish. Offers the basics but nothing more."
France,89.0,40.0,Champagne,Gremillet,"A blend of up to five different vintages go into this ripe, full and fruity Champagne. It has a touch of maturity, vibrant acidity and crisp lemon-like fruit. It's fresh and ready to drink."
France,86.0,14.0,Entre-Deux-Mers,ChÃ¢teau Tuilerie PagÃ¨s,"This is an attractive herbaceous wine that's light and tangy. Its gooseberry character dominates, lending acidity and a lively, crisp finish. The wine's blue bottle is memorable."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Romagna,Noelia Ricci,"This no-fuss red opens with aromas of red berry and underbrush. The cheerful palate offers strawberry, cinnamon and a hint of orange peel accompanied by smooth tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux,Cheval Quancard,"Marked by its five months in wood, this warm, ripe and spicy wine is packed with rich black fruits and light generous tannins. It is a chunky wine, solid with its dry core while full and warm with its fruits. Drink now."
France,86.0,14.0,Entre-Deux-Mers,ChÃ¢teau Rousset-Caillau,"Green fruits and an herbal character give this wine brightness and freshness, balanced by riper tropical fruits that come in with their softer edge. Still young, the wine is ready to drink now although is likely to be better from summer 2016."
US,94.0,36.0,California,Nelle,"Intriguing layers of fruit and herbs interplay on the delicious nose of this bottling, showing bay leaf, thyme, oregano, pepper, hibiscus and cherry. The palate is rich and savory, with more of the same roasting herbs as well as fig, black olive, black pepper, fennel and purple-flower flavors. It's quite rich and delicious."
Italy,87.0,35.0,Bolgheri,Grattamacco,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot and Sangiovese, this forward wine offers sweet black cherry, red currant, black pepper, toasted oak and espresso sensations. The ripe palate finishes on a note of drying tannins. Drink soon."
US,87.0,25.0,Rogue Valley,Folin Cellars,"A floral nose greets you at first sniff, followed by hints of light citrus. A mix of grapefruit, melon and apple flavors are light and enticing, keeping the wine delicate and balanced. The finish leaves an impression of lemon tea."
Italy,92.0,77.0,Barolo,Fratelli Alessandria,"This terrific producer does a great job of capturing the magic of Nebbiolo. It is elegant and fine but powerful and bold at the same time. Sweet fruit and exotic spice give this wine a playful, modern flair. Drink after 2018."
France,85.0,16.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau de la Vieille Tour,"Fruity and crisp, this is an attractive lemon and pear-flavored wine from certified organic vineyards. With fresh, balanced acidity and a creamy texture, this 60% Sauvignon and 40% SÃ©millon blend is ready to drink."
US,88.0,87.0,Paso Robles,HammerSky,"One of the winery's luxury-level releases, this doesn't play the massive Paso ripeness game, instead offering easy notes of black currant, violet, grape candy and burnt caramel on the nose. The palate is even more restrained, with black cherries, baking spice, a touch of asphalt and soft tannins."
US,90.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,McCay Cellars,"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end."
France,89.0,18.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau l'Avocat,"The high proportion of SÃ©millon in the blend gives the wine an extra richness. That rounds out the more herbaceous character and brings in ripe peach and kiwi flavors. It's already a lively, drinkable wine, but should only improve over another few months."
France,92.0,25.0,Moulis-en-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Duplessis,"Dating back at least to the 17th century, Duplessis was one a hunting lodge. Today, owned by the Lurton family, it has produced a dark and dense wine that has a dry structure at the moment, with a strong extraction character. However, the potential black fruits promise future richness. Drink from 2018."
US,88.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer."
US,86.0,18.0,Wahluke Slope,Hogue,"Aromas of mandarin orange, peach and herb are followed by lightly styled, off-dry drinking but still well-balanced fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
Argentina,90.0,17.0,Tupungato,Finca Sophenia,"This muscular Malbec opens with a blast of ripe berry aromas offset by oaky coconut notes. A plump palate avoids being pudgy, while plum, black cherry and blackberry flavors end with a turn of oaky vanilla and balancing residual acidity."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Umbria,Barberani,"Here's a savory blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano that opens with aromas of meat juice, soil, prune and plum. The palate offers juicy black cherry, raspberry, mint and tobacco, with hints of truffle and underbrush in a ripe, ready-to-enjoy style."
US,87.0,36.0,Alexander Valley,Reynoso,"This Syrah is marked by fruit. The oak is modest, staying in the background, with only a suggestion of toast. The flavors are ripe, suggesting black-cherry jam, chocolate, mu shu plum sauce and peppery spices. Drink it now."
US,86.0,18.0,Amador County,Terra d'Oro,"A dry, tannic Zinfandel from Amador, fairly large production at 14,000 cases a year, with enough blueberry, sweet black olive and spice on the finish to make the whole package a nicely made bottling from a Sierra Foothills Zin specialist."
US,88.0,29.0,Alexander Valley,Ousterhout,"Fire up the barbie for this robust, delicious Zinfandel. It's full bodied, dry and tannic, with sweet, ripe black-and red currant, licorice, pepper, cola and sandalwood flavors. It has Zin's briary, powerful personality, yet manages to rein it in toward balance."
Italy,90.0,19.0,Morellino di Scansano,Terenzi,"Rich in wild cherry, raspberry, black cherry and white pepper, this delicious wine offers all the juicy fruit, freshness, minerality and supple tannins that make a young, well-made Morellino so attractive. Extremely enjoyable now, it will maintain beautifully until 2017??018 and develop more depth."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Castillo De Feliciana,"Aromas of citrus rind, baking spice and baked bread fill the aromas. The palate is tart with lively fruit flavors."
US,90.0,55.0,North Fork of Long Island,Harbes Family Vineyard,"Ripe yet deftly balanced, this full-bodied wine offers an abundance of blackberry fruitiness balanced by tones of granite and dried herb. It's sumptuous and expansive on the palate, finishing long with fine, sharply edged tannins."
France,87.0,10.0,Vin de France,L. Tramier & Fils,"Based in Burgundy, this producer understands Chardonnay. That's why this wine is so finely balanced, with a ripe and perfumed character and a warm, full aftertaste. Drink now."
US,83.0,26.0,Monterey,Pianetta,"Dry and very acidic, with a cutting edge of tartness alongside the cherry and tobacco flavors. Rich meats and cheeses will help soften it."
US,90.0,20.0,Washington,Almquist,"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (65%) and Barbera. Cranberry, raspberry and baking spice aromas are followed by generous tart fruit flavors with an electric jolt of acid. The acid is quite bracing to have on its own. Pair it with pasta with a red sauce."
US,88.0,35.0,Dry Creek Valley,Laura Michael,"High-pitched acidity helps balance the bigger, bolder elements of truffle earth, leather and cherry cordial than run freely in this full-bodied softly textured wine."
US,92.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gramercy,"There's no mistaking the variety, with plentiful aromas of fresh herb and cherry alongside vanilla and light barrel accents. The dark fruit flavors are supple with a mesmerizing texture and an exquisite balance that extends through the coffee-filled finish. The attention to detail throughout is impressive, especially for a wine at this price."
France,86.0,19.0,Chinon,Bougrier,"Light and smoky, this is a fruit-forward, soft wine. Berry flavors are balanced by the stalky texture. It's young, although very ready to drink."
France,87.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du Marmandais,Cave du Marmandais,"For its youth, this is a rich, smooth wine. The tannins, even from the Malbec in the blend, are full, rounded and already integrated. Acidity and an attractive smokiness give this wine its already-drinkable character. Drink from the end of 2015."
US,86.0,34.0,Oak Knoll District,PiÃ±a,"The caramel oakiness of this wine is offset by austere structure and a focused midpalate, the flavors leaning toward cool-climate green apple and kumquat. It returns to richness and intensity on the finish."
US,91.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Burnt Bridge,"This is 58% Grenache, 39% Syrah, and 3% Tempranillo. It's a real fruit salad of a wine?fresh and loaded with strawberries, cherry candy, cola and cream. Forward and fruit-driven, it's enormously appealing and ready to drink right now."
US,93.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Justin,"This blend of 55% Cabernet Franc and 45% Merlot is quite ripe on the nose, with lavish black-currant fruit as well as dried dill and fennel touches. Impressively soft and thick, the tannic structure coats every corner of the mouth, carrying flavors of black cherry, mint-laced chocolate and black truffle."
US,87.0,60.0,Dundee Hills,Torii Mor,"Among the early releases of the 2011 single-vineyard Pinots from Torii Mor, the Olson seems to be the one that had the most difficulty achieving full ripeness. Scents and flavors are focused upon green tea, peppery herbs, even a suggestion of fiddlehead ferns. The fruit reaches rhubarb-level ripeness and remains there, but the balance and structure are first-rate."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Astoria,"This opens with whiffs of yellow apple, pineapple and white spring flowers. The palate delivers tropical fruit and white peach alongside crackling acidity and persistent, vigorous bubbles."
Spain,90.0,75.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Comando-G,"While this high-elevation (4,035 feet) white Garnacha is mostly neutral smelling, it offers stony notes that are direct, minerally and clean. On the palate, it is tightly wound and showing vital malic acid. Salty but fresh persimmon and quince flavors are lasting on the finish. For a 2014, this is in fine shape; drink now."
US,88.0,25.0,Lodi,PRIE Vineyards and Winery,"Aromas like apple skin and peach skin lead to flavors with a little more heft and ripeness, like pears, lychees and apricots. It offers a lot of taste complexity and easily keeps the interest going with good acidity, medium body and an almost spicy finish."
US,84.0,45.0,Paso Robles,Justin,"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot is not one of Justin's best efforts. It's simple in construction, with soft tannins and cherry pie, red licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish with a touch of bell pepper."
Italy,91.0,53.0,Cortona,La Braccesca,"Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco, allspice and mocha unfold in the glass along with a note of tilled earth. The opulent palate offers blackberry extract, dried plum, licorice and chocolate while velvety tannins provide support and give it a smooth texture. Drink through 2019."
Argentina,92.0,20.0,Mendoza,Bodega Renacer,"With its reliance on old-vines vineyards, Renacer often comes out with great wines. This is one of them. Smoky, leathery berry aromas are inviting, while the mouthfeel is silky and plush. Oaky flavors of chocolate, smoked meat and vanilla accent ripe berry flavors, then clove and baking spices pour onto the finish."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Mendoza,Zolo,"After rubbery, dark-fruit aromas set things up, the palate feels racy and forward, with dark berry, spice and peppery flavors. It feels solid on the finish, while the fruit character holds on for a good while. Readily available, with 300,000 cases made."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Sirch,"Intense aromas of mature pear and Granny Smith apples carry over to the palate along with lemon-lime and honey dew melon. Crisp acidity gives this a clean, refreshing finish."
France,92.0,24.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"Perfumed, subtle apple notes unfold on the creamy, biscuity palate. This is rounded but fresh, generous but shows tension. A central seam of acidity keeps the dry palate very supple and lets the purity of this wine speak clearly. The mousse is somewhere between creamy and frothy and thus very invigorating."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Terlano,"Sleek and polished, this opens with aromas of raspberry preserve and rose petal. The elegant palate offers crushed red berry with hints of green tea, cinnamon and a mineral note alongside firm acidity and supple tannins."
France,87.0,25.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bel Enclos,"For such a young wine, this is surprisingly mature. Its tannins have softened and rounded, becoming well integrated with the black currant flavor and bright acidity. It's an attractive choice to drink now or over the next few years, but not for long-term aging."
US,89.0,16.0,Lodi,Seven Deadly Zins,"This full-bodied wine has a deep color and smoke and charcoal aromas. The flavors are ripe, concentrated, grapy and berry-like. The texture has moderate tannins but is polished around the edges. It's a big and rowdy wine that doesn't lose control."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Alto Adige,Girlan,"You'll love the delicate floral fragrances of this feminine, cool-climate northern Italian white. Acacia, jasmine and honeysuckle play a leading role with a supporting cast of stone fruit and pear. In the mouth, it's not particularly intense or thick."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Prosecco Treviso,Masottina,Pretty scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit rise from the glass. The off-dry refreshing palate offers sweet white peach and candied citrus peel alongside bright acidity and a soft mousse.
France,91.0,39.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine de la Croix Senaillet,"This wine has spice, concentrated yellow fruits and a delicious backbone of acidity. With its acidity firmly in place, the wine is beginning to reveal the richer yellow fruit and tangy lemon. Already delicious, it will be better from 2017."
US,90.0,18.0,Amador County,Terra d'Oro,"This is a dark, almost thick, velvet-textured wine with plenty of tannin and flavors of blackberry and black pepper. While mouthcoating in texture, its not overly full in body, and will pair well with cheesy pastas and rich meat braises."
US,87.0,42.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Foxen,"Lots of ripe, luscious raspberry, cherry and mocha fruit in this Cabernet. It has good acidity and some fine tannins. One drawback is the finish, which is rich in brown sugar and glycerine, with high alcohol. Drink up."
France,90.0,50.0,CÃ´tes de Bergerac,ChÃ¢teau Tour des Gendres,"Hugely concentrated wine, full of new toasty wood flavors, its structure packed with tannins. That said, there is also a weight of black currant fruit, richly jammy, adding to the sense of power."
US,84.0,32.0,Lake Michigan Shore,Three Fires,Faint notes of yuzu rise over underripe peach in this unoaked Chardonnay. The light-bodied palate shows a mild concentration of lemon leading to a short but clean finish.
Italy,88.0,20.0,Umbria,Marchesi Antinori,"This 100% Chardonnay, from Antinori's Castello della Sala estate, opens with aromas of Golden Delicious apples, vanilla and a whiff of oak. The palate delivers creamy apple and juicy lemon flavors, with notes of well-integrated oak. Despite the richness, it's also elegant and fresh."
US,89.0,44.0,Santa Maria Valley,Dierberg,"A delicious aromatic range of smoked meats, spicy strawberries and cinnamon-laced churros introduce this wine from one of the appellation's most promising vineyards. Red fruits and brown spice power the palate, with noticeable tannins and a good wash of acid on the finish."
US,83.0,20.0,Monterey County-Napa County,Stickybeak,"This is a simple, sweetly fruity wine, more Shiraz than Syrah, with jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors. Napa brings ripeness, while Monterey brings acidity. Drink up."
US,82.0,33.0,California,Villa Andretti,"Super-high in acids, almost sour, and tannic too, with dry flavors of bitter cherries. If this is your kind of wine, break out the rich meats, butter and cheese and enjoy."
France,90.0,20.0,Tavel,ChÃ¢teau de SÃ©griÃ¨s,"A fine example of what Tavel can be, this is a full-bodied, luscious rosÃ© with a bit of sturdiness to its structure. Cherry and peach notes fade into hints of fresh herb and cocoa on the long, harmonious finish. Drink now and through the summer of 2014."
US,93.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Merry Edwards,"Klopp is a mix of California and Burgundy clones, one of the producer's finest offerings every year, made in an opulent, balanced style. Lush layers of strawberry and cherry are surrounded by truffle-like dirt. The wine is concentrated in tannin and subtle oak, while anise marks the measured finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar through 2020."
Italy,91.0,35.0,Etna,I Custodi,"Part of the natural wine movement, this organically farmed blend of Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio and Alicante shows harmony and elegance. It shows some age too, with aromas of tar, licorice, cassis, prune and dark tobacco. It feels supersmooth and silky."
Argentina,89.0,11.0,Mendoza,Lagarde,"This is your quintessential New World Best Buy. The bouquet is full, slightly oaky and a touch burnt, and overall it's very nice. Same goes for the mouth, full of ripe berry and cassis flavors. It's medium to full in terms of weight and intensity, while the tannins create a chewy, masculine sensation."
Italy,87.0,26.0,RuchÃ© di Castagnole Monferrato,Cantine Sant'Agata,"Pro Nobis is a good example of the RuchÃ© grape (a mysterious variety from Piedmont with some similarities to Brachetto). The wine offers aromas of wild berries and blue violets, backed by medium consistency and bright acidity. Pair it with cheesy pasta dishes."
France,92.0,60.0,Champagne,Vollereaux,"This is a beautiful wine showing remarkable richness and maturity. Hints of toast and bright fruits combine seamlessly to yield a full, ripe wine marked with with intense acidity. With concentration from old vines showing strongly, it's a wine that's ready to drink now."
Spain,89.0,29.0,Priorat,Portal del Priorat,"Rubber, Band-Aid and leathery red-fruit aromas open this blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah. In the mouth, this is blocky and collapsed. Roasted plum and berry flavors carry a medicinal note, while this is chewy and tastes lightly herbal on a tannic, weighty finish."
Italy,90.0,17.0,Falanghina del Sannio,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Jasmine, honeysuckle, apricot and citrus aromas open. The bright, savory palate presents juicy pineapple, ripe pear, white peach and lemon zest framed in tangy acidity. Hints of Mediterranean herb add depth while a mineral note energizes the finish."
US,90.0,32.0,Santa Maria Valley,Riverbench,"This is a familiar and tasty take on the grape, with aromas of caramel, buttercream, vanilla smoke, brown spices and squeezed lemons. There's sea salt and lemon-lime on the palate, which is straightforward but quite clean and crisp."
France,91.0,35.0,Sancerre,Domaine Laporte,"Produced from vines located between Chavignol and Sancerre, this comes from pure chalk soil. It is crisp while having a warmer, more rounded character. It's full of apple and pineapple as well as citrus fruits which are added to the young, tight mineral texture. Aromatic and ripe, the wine should age a year or two and will be better from 2017."
France,91.0,40.0,Vouvray,Domaine Pichot,"A rich dessert Vouvray with a marvelous tension between acidity and honeyed sweetness. There is a floral character, offering a contrast and bringing out a fresher side to the wine. With the tension and texture, the wine will age. Drink from 2017."
US,85.0,40.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Westerly,"You'll find luxuriously ripe apricot, pineapple, white currant and peach flavors in this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Chardonnay. It's a bit stewed in fruit, though, and ready to drink now with sweetish fare."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Maremma,Rocca di Montemassi,"Hats off to the Zonin family for being among the first to offer a Viognier from southern Tuscany. This shows the thick viscosity that is characteristic of the variety, with floral notes of violets and lemon blossoms. There's a dusty touch of mineral or brimstone on the finish."
US,89.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Napa by N.A.P.A.,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Barbera and a few other varieties, this is dry and complex. It has cherry, plum, red licorice, spice and cedar flavors."
Argentina,86.0,10.0,Uco Valley,Salentein,"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish."
France,88.0,12.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Jean-Luc Colombo,"This blend of 40% Clairette, 30% Grenache Blanc, 20% Viognier and 10% Roussanne offers up delicate lemony scents alongside hints of pineapple. It's a medium-bodied white, displaying freshness and finesse in its citrus, pear and melon flavors. Drink it over the next year."
US,87.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Chateau Lafayette Reneau,"This delightful surprise from upstate New York features Pinot Grigio-like lime and herb aromas. A touch of chalk and the faintest hint of peachy fruit on the palate add to its appeal. Displays good feel and finish, with lingering citrus flavors."
US,88.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Frei Brothers,"Good price for an elegant Chardonnay with such richness. The pineapple, lime and smoky oak flavors have a caramelized sweetness, but acidity is brisk, and there's a fine minerality that makes the wine finish dry."
US,91.0,27.0,Santa Barbara County,Municipal Winemakers,"Bright and fruity, this blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Counoise and Syrah shows strawberry, pomegranate, hibiscus, rose, sumac and fennel scents on the nose. A fennel element plays on the palate as well, alongside cranberry, raspberry and turned earth flavors."
Italy,91.0,43.0,Recioto di Soave Classico,Coffele,"This opens with aromas of dried yellow peach, white flower and ripe pear. Made with dried Garganega grapes, the savory palate delivers dried tangerine, apricot jam and a touch of caramel. It has good length and fresh acidity."
US,95.0,50.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Sea Smoke,"A fabulously rich and approachable Pinot Noir that offers everything now, yet will also age. The considerable tannins will protect it in the cellar for a good 6?? years, but it's so fresh and vibrant in cherries, red currants and oak-inspired red licorice that it's hard not to drink it now. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness factor."
Spain,92.0,48.0,Rioja,Consejo de la Alta,"Blackberry, black currant and toasty oak make for a dark, charred, manly nose. This is full but not heavy, with racy acidity and firm tannins. Blackberry, baked plum and savory flavors finish with notes of prune and leather as well as salted cured meat. Drink through 2022."
US,95.0,120.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Horsepower,"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Markham,"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016."
US,88.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Milbrandt,"A blend of seven different varieties, this wine is aromatic and fruit forward, recalling blueberry pie and cocoa with a citrus top note. It's plush but still deft in feel with soft tannins and abundant blue-fruit flavors."
US,92.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Adelsheim,"Star fruit and citrus notes build into riper peach and tree fruit flavors. A hint of powdered sugar colors the finish, as does a burst of buttered toast. Still integrating, this will reward further cellaring. Drink 2019??030."
France,91.0,22.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau du Galoupet,"From one of the classed growths of Provence, this wine is intense with ripe fruits. Red plum, red currant and berry fruit flavors go with a steely, nervy texture that needs to age. Drink from the end of 2014."
US,83.0,18.0,Yakima Valley,Hyatt,"Reserve it may be, but it is a thin wine nonetheless, with hard, green flavors and a stemmy, tannic finish. ?P.G.  Sangiovese"
Italy,91.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Panzanello,"Firm and fragrant, this opens with scents of violet, iris, ripe plum and sweet baking spice. The chewy palate delivers dried plum, ripe black cherry, white pepper, anise and clove while fine-grained, polished tannins provide support."
US,87.0,52.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Sunstone,"Wraps minty, pepper-infused cherry flavors into a very soft texture, giving a wine of considerable lushness and attraction. Right on the edge of the Merlot revolution going on in the warmer parts of Santa Ynez Valley, and a wine to watch."
France,87.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du Marmandais,Cave du Marmandais,"This is a ripe, perfumed blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris. It is smooth and creamy in texture, with rich apricot and pear flavors. Spice comes from five months wood aging. It is ready to drink."
France,87.0,27.0,Sancerre,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"The wine is stalky with tight tannins and just a touch of spicy wood. It has acidity, bitter cherry fruits and structure. Drink now."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Jasci & Marchesani,"This easygoing red has aromas of dark berry, wild herb and a hint of cooking spice. The simple zesty palate offers dark cherry, raspberry and a hint of cinnamon alongside dusty tannins."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Marche,Domodimonti,"A plump blend of 50% Merlot and 50% MonteÂ­pulciano, this opens with a sweet cherry flavor, followed by notes of tobacco, leather and cola. Pair this with pork sausages."
Italy,91.0,18.0,Biferno Rosso,Di Majo Norante,"Soft and plush, this blend of Montepulciano (80%) and Aglianico has beautiful intensity to its long-lasting aromas of blackberry, maraschino, chocolate, exotic spice and leather. There's a bright touch of mint and licorice on the finish."
US,92.0,38.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"The Wedding CuvÃ©e is one of Iron Horse's sweeter bubblies, but it's not a sweet wine. It's soft, creamy and delicious. Brimming with flavors of green apples, strawberries, brioche and pepper, it continues the winery's brilliant tradition of crafting some of the finest sparkling wines in California."
US,90.0,45.0,Monticello,Trump,"Exuberant green apple and quince aromas meet a savory almond-croissant tone on the nose of this 100% Chardonnay sparkler. Time in French oak and extended aging on the lees have rounded and broadened the mouthfeel, offering a rich palate accented by lemon rind and candied nuts. Vibrant acidity and finely-beaded bubbles keep things light and entertaining."
France,89.0,20.0,Cahors,Georges Vigouroux,"Fragrant, soft and fruity, this has weight and firm tannins, which meld with the juicy blackberry flavor. The result is a forward and ready-to-drink wine."
US,92.0,40.0,Red Mountain,Fidelitas,"All varietal, this wine is a blend of Scooteney Flats, Kiona and Canyons vineyards. Aromas of exotic spices, clove and purple fruit lead to elegant supple flavors that linger. It still needs time to fully blossom."
US,91.0,64.0,Oakville,Groth,"Mellowed with 20% Merlot, this full-bodied, structured wine shows supple tannin and dark cherry, blackberry and tobacco flavors. Oak-derived notes of vanilla, clove and smoke are also present, albeit in measured quantity."
US,86.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Eco Terreno,"Big oak defines this robustly dense and extracted red, swimming in vanilla and cherry flavor. Full-bodied and gravelly in texture, it's a rustically pleasant wine for pizza nights and crowds."
Italy,92.0,72.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Foradori,"Made with Teroldego from three different vineyards, this offers aromas of truffle, leather, scorched soil, black plum and a whiff of game. Aged and fermented in wood, the savory palate offers ripe blackberry, spiced blueberry, earthy notes of Mediterranean herbs and dark cooking spice. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2016??026."
US,85.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Siduri,"Doesn't taste fully ripe, with a wintergreen, minty edge to the raspberries and cherries. Sugary sweet in the finish, too. Shows the difficulties of this extremely cool vintage."
France,87.0,12.0,Lirac,ChÃ¢teau de SÃ©griÃ¨s,"Not quite as impressive as the wonderful 1998, this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah features solid black-cherry fruit and hints of smoke but seems a bit compact, with firm structure. Still, the persistent finish and reasonable depth suggest it will show better in a couple of months."
US,94.0,155.0,Stags Leap District,Chimney Rock,"Juicy and supple, this wine astounds with its ability to be generously broad in appeal yet with undeniable complexity and tension. Its soft texture betrays chalky tannic grip, while its fruit and spice attributes?a mix of cardamon, clove and brambly berry?become increasingly intense."
US,90.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,QupÃ©,"Plump boysenberry and dewy sagebrush meet with a touch of wet asphalt on the nose of this bottling by Bob Lindquist, whose pioneering brand is now part of Charles Banks' portfolio. Dark purple fruits, from blueberry to blackberry, show on the palate, but with refreshing tartness, as do more complex nuances of menthol, eucalyptus and incense."
US,90.0,30.0,Santa Maria Valley,Chanin,"Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay. Shows a ino Sherry-like yeastiness, and is minerally and streamlined. Zesty flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits round out the finish."
US,85.0,26.0,Paso Robles,Midnight,"This Chardonnay underwent aging in new French oak and sur lie battonage, yielding a wine that's certainly rich, but also jammy with flavors of pineapples, oranges and vanilla cream."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Ca' Rugate,"Here's a concentrated Valpolicella that opens with aromas of new leather, truffle, French oak and a balsamic note. The firm palate shows raisin, fig and oak-driven spice alongside close-grained tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato,"Traditionally, Prosecco sparkling wines were executed in a dry style, which means they have enough sweetness to change the aromatic profile and softness of the mouthfeel. Indeed, fresh peach and apricot emerge from the bouquet and the wine feels round and creamy overall."
US,84.0,28.0,Southern Oregon,Spangler,"There are odd hints of plastic in the nose and in the flavor, along with black-cherry fruit. In the mouth this wine feels disjointed, with a chalky, short finish and a hint of coconut."
France,89.0,26.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Louis MÃ©taireau,"Rich, full, this is a great mouthful of ripe red apple and grapefruit. It is big, vivacious and densely mouthfilling. The acidity is certainly not aggressive, but offers freshness and crispness."
France,88.0,32.0,Alsace,Domaine Fritz Schmitt,"Floral overtones join ripe pear notes on the nose. The palate comes in with even more generous, juicy pear fruit, the rounded flavors boosted by a little residual sweetness that makes the wine finish off dry."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Sicilia,Donnafugata,"Bright and juicy, this opens with heady aromas of fragrant white flower, citrus and ripe orchard fruit. Mirroring the nose, the fresh palate doles out mature apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine zest alongside a note of Mediterranean scrub."
France,88.0,47.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Louis Latour,"This is a big, bold wine with scents of ripe pear and a hint of anise. The fruit seems to grow and add dimension in the mouth, featuring pears and peaches that are topped off with a dollop of spicy oak and butter."
Italy,95.0,460.0,Toscana,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,"Fruit was picked later than normal and the Masseto Merlot does indeed show mature aromas of black cherry, ripe blackberry, earthy iron and polished stone. The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish. It is already showing beautiful evolution in the glass."
US,89.0,16.0,Potter Valley,McFadden,"Pretty and pink, this light-colored wine has subtle peach aromas that continue to dry fruit flavors that are peachy and crisp. A little bite in the texture makes the mouth water."
US,81.0,8.0,California,The Original Dark Horse,"The price is right. It's soft and sweet, with jammy, candy flavors."
US,90.0,18.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Made in a delicious, dry style, this has a vivid yellow-gold color, lemon and butter aromas, a touch of honey in the Bosc pear flavors and a creamy texture that leads to a long finish. Not much of this variety is made in California and the acreage is dwindling in Livermore Valley, so this bottling is a rare treat."
Spain,84.0,25.0,Ribeira Sacra,Ponte da Boga,"A mash of coffee, turned earth, Band-Aid and charred, baked berry aromas are funky and lead to a wide, flabby palate with briny berry and red-fruit flavors. That charred character from the nose persists on the finish, which tastes roasted and feels pinched."
France,88.0,60.0,Champagne,Brimoncourt,"This grower in AÃ¿ on the Montagne de Reims has produced a rich style of rosÃ©. It emphasizes red fruit, soft acidity and creamy texture. Ripe and full, it's ready to drink."
US,86.0,28.0,Red Mountain,Convergence Zone,"A Bordeaux-style blend, tart and fruity, with an unusual fruit flavor mix that starts with citrus and orange and runs into bright berries. Two things keep the score down?a chalky edge to the tannins, and some noticeable volatility (a whiff of nail polish)on the nose."
US,84.0,125.0,Sonoma Valley,Lasseter,"This wine is comprised of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Dusty earthiness frames its green, vegetal flavors, wrapped in ripe, sturdy tannins and bitter leather and clove notes."
US,87.0,18.0,Virginia,Fabbioli Cellars,"This wine is abundant with aromas of cherry Coke, sarsaparilla and baking spice. The palate is delicate yet is given some weight from seven months in neutral French and American oak. This wine gains a soft texture from Tannat skins added during fermentation."
US,89.0,25.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Beckmen,"This winery's workhorse blend of 45% Syrah, 40% Grenache, 8% Counoise and 7% MourvÃ¨dre shows aromas of boysenberry, asphalt, peppercorn and lilac on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft yet the palate is still wound up nicely, offering tart plum, black raspberry, black pepper, chipped slate and earthy flavors."
France,85.0,15.0,Coteaux Bourguignons,Vignerons de Bel Air,"Ripe and creamy, this is an attractive wine that has forward apple, lemon and green-plum flavors. It's a lightly textured, vanilla-touched wine that can be drunk now."
France,91.0,38.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Tracy,This is a richly ripe 2009 Pouilly FumÃ©. It steers right to the tropical fruit end of the spectrum while not losing sight of a more textured mineral character. It is rich and could age for 1?? years and more.
France,94.0,62.0,Beaune,Louis Jadot,"This wine is dark, with a strong sense of structure. Dense black fruits are cut with strawberry acidity and a dark tension between fruit and firm tannins. The coiled power will allow this beautiful wine age for many years. Drink from 2020."
France,89.0,16.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine des Nugues,"Powerful and concentrated, this has a dark red-plum flavor and solid tannins. It is dense, and it shows the structure of the vintage. This is worth aging, and it certainly needs food to show at its best."
US,89.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ryan Patrick,"This is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 8% Syrah. The influence of 18 months in oak is showing strongly, though some very pretty raspberry candy flavors come through also. Give it extra breathing time to help balance it out."
France,87.0,35.0,Champagne,Dom Caudron,"Pure Pinot Meunier from the Marne Valley, this is a soft, fruity wine. Apples and ripe pears show strongly along with a lightly tangy citrus edge. The basic nonvintage wine in this Meunier specialist's range, it is attractive and ready to drink."
France,95.0,74.0,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,"Hay flowers, honey and ripe yellow pear create an alluring nose. The palate adds even more fruit, with juicy mirabelle and peach carried by boost of residual sugar. This richness is aptly countered by lemon and tangerine zest. This joyful exuberant medium-sweet wine has a tightrope balance and incredibly deep and rich dimensions of fruit. The finish is lasting and pure. Drink 2017??037."
US,91.0,35.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Luna Hart,"Very fresh and lively carnation, rose petal, tarragon, elderberry and strawberry aromas show on the nose of this bottling from young winemaker Gretchen Voelcker. Deep cranberry flavors show on the strong and pleasant palate, where dried herb and peppery spice notes add complexity."
US,91.0,45.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Sante Arcangeli,"Winemaker John Benedetti relies on a single clone usually used for sparkling wine in this bottling from a 25-year-old dry-farmed vineyard at 1,700 feet. Aromas of buttered cherries, rhubarb, red flowers, cinnamon and milk chocolate give way to a palate that shows lots of slate and graphite as well as dried cherry, eucalyptus, dried mint and a touch of leathery gaminess."
US,89.0,28.0,California,Solitary Cellars,"This full-bodied attractively dry wine has very flavorful blackberry and black-cherry accents and a good grippy moderately tannic texture. Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, it's nicely balanced and complete: a go-to wine for almost any occasion."
US,87.0,24.0,Monticello,Stinson,"Grapefruit spray and gooseberry aromas jump from the glass initially, with an herbal tomato-leaf tone lingering behind. Lemon-lime acidity cuts through the medium-bodied palate of underripe peach and tropical fruit, leading to a talc-dusted finish. This is zesty, lively and perfectly enjoyable as an apÃ©ritif or paired alongside tangy cheese."
US,84.0,15.0,Central Coast,Bargetto,"Heavy handed in ripe fruit and oak, with a soft, sweet mouthfeel. Will appeal to fans of the tropical fruit and buttered toast style of Chardonnay."
Spain,91.0,50.0,Alella,Alta Alella,"This dense, purple wine is packed with roasted, charred aromas of burnt toast, espresso and plum. The palate is creamy and smooth, with good core acidity. Flavors of loamy berry, raw oak, chocolate and herbs finish smooth, woody and lush. Only 300 cases made; drink through 2019."
Australia,83.0,25.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"Deep golden straw in color, with modest aromas of struck flint and pear. The flavors are reminiscent of buttery, honeyed pears, yet stay tart from start to finish. Perplexing."
Spain,90.0,30.0,Ribera del Duero,Valtravieso,"Gritty berry and olive aromas are woodsy and a touch flat. This feels full and grabby, while flavors of tea, herbal blackberry, salt and roasted meat finish blackened and peppery, with a toasty element that gets more pronounced the longer this sits. Drink through 2022."
US,88.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,J. Christopher,"This clean, fresh, bracingly grassy wine makes you wish there were more Sauv Blancs from the Willamette Valley. It has the crisp elegance of the Loire, along with a delicate suggestion of chalk."
Italy,89.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,PianCornello,"Scorched soil, toasted oak, dried sage and roasted coffee bean aromas lead the nose. The approachable, full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, espresso and a hint of clove alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
US,92.0,125.0,Sonoma County,Hidden Ridge,"This robustly generous wine is impactful in chocolate and sweet, soft plum. A complexity of cedar, herb and blackberry marks the palate, with integrated tannins and oak. The complementary elements provide intrigue and flavor in a heavyweight package, ready for cellaring through 2022."
US,86.0,25.0,California,Circadia,"Baking spices and almost-sweetness come out in the aroma and continue in the flavors, making this a full-bodied and enthusiastically fruity wine. The texture is smooth and broad and includes some fine-textured tannins."
US,88.0,25.0,Chehalem Mountains,Potter's Vineyard,"Sourced from a three-acre vineyard planted in 2001, this smooth and quite pretty Pinot is round and fruity, offering lots of blueberry and raspberry fruit. It's laced together with a tight streak of coffee and toast."
US,95.0,55.0,Mount Veeder,Hess Collection,"From one of the few Napa Valley wineries to showcase Malbec, this wine is a testament to the virtues of that devotion. It offers rich, dreamy flavors of blueberry cobbler, blackberry and licorice, lifted acidity and plush, soft tannins, all gorgeously finished in spicy chocolate and vanilla."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Salcheto,"The nose of this wine is brimming with dark fruit, spice and toasted-oak fragrances. The palate shows oaky notes of coffee and toast, with soft plum and pepper undertones. It's straightforward, with a drying, tannic finish."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni,"Subdued aromas suggesting black plum, game and moist soil come together on this. The thin simple palate offers morello cherry and a hint of brown spice alongside loose, fleeting tannins and zesty acidity."
US,88.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cave B,"Pine and herb and green apple scents introduce this sharply defined wine, with crisp acidity and bright fruit flavors. It's tight and juicy, an excellent companion to creamy dishes or soft cheeses."
US,84.0,42.0,Atlas Peak,City Winery of New York,"There's a tension between leanness and grip in this Cab, from the mountainous terrain of Atlas Peak. Black tea and tarragon intermingle between near-hidden layers of black fruit."
Italy,93.0,170.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Masi,"Mature black plum, tobacco, crushed violet, cake spice and toast aromas mingle together in the glass. The taut full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, orange peel and licorice alongside a backbone of close-grained tannins. This is still extremely young and tightly wound, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019??029."
US,90.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"All varietal, this wine offers unique aromas of toast, fig, dried herb and exotic spice. The purple fruit flavors are deft in style with a pleasing sense of balance, length and texture."
US,96.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"A splendid Chardonnay, rich, vital and elegant, with so many layers of interest. Framed by a cut of brilliant acidity, it evolves with complex flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals, flowers and honey, then finishes long and savory in a swirl of spices. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast, while the wine is a study in the creamy effect of sur lie aging. It's perfectly dry on the finish."
US,87.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Skyfall,"Light aromas of spice, dried herbs and plum lead to plump blue-fruit flavors with a touch of sugar stitching them together. This doesn't bring a lot of complexity but still has appeal."
France,90.0,45.0,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,"A creamier notion of ripe apples with custard pervades both nose and palate of this soft wine. The acidity is bright and pure but cushioned by creaminess that gives this a very approachable, very friendly and fruity aspect."
US,88.0,47.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reininger,"Chuck Reininger sources the fruit for this wine from what is arguably the best site in the Walla Walla Valley. The wine does not shy away from the herbal aspect for which CarmenÃ¨re is known, but the stemminess is mitigated thanks to the influence of new French oak. A cherry candy note consolidates the flavors on the medium-long finish."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,Poliziano,"Leather, earth, wild flower, cedar, red currant and wild cherry aromas lead the nose on this robust wine. The ripe, simple palate doles out rich black cherry, vanilla, cinnamon and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. Drink soon for freshness."
US,85.0,24.0,Bennett Valley,Baldassari Family Wines,"Baldassari's 2010 is rich in blackberries, currants, mocha and crispy bacon, but the texture is off. Drink up."
US,86.0,34.0,Virginia,Rappahannock Cellars,"This wine is a blend of about equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a balance of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The nose is toast and oak driven, bringing notes of charred currant and dark-roast coffee. Medium bodied on the palate, structured tannins offer support to flavors of racy red and black currant, red plum skin and toasted vanilla."
Spain,89.0,16.0,Valencia,Bodegas Rafael Cambra,"This is a clean, fresh style of Garnacha with floral black cherry aromas offset by a minty note. The palate has a zingy feel and crisp, fresh plum, raspberry and dry herb flavors. As a whole it's focused and uncomplicated; this is very good Garnacha from one of the Valencia region's better producers."
Italy,92.0,74.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Terralsole,"Here's a thick and opulent Brunello Riserva with a pleasurable and forward style that puts emphasis on intensity, quality of fruit and texture. The wine boasts a dark garnet color with aromas that span from exotic spice to pressed flowers. It needs at least five more years of cellar aging because the tannins are still a bit young."
US,90.0,37.0,Napa Valley,Ravenswood,"A 100% varietal wine, this offers a juiciness of red fruit that's deliciously inviting, surrounded by plenty of cinnamon and black pepper. Grippy and full bodied, it reins in its ripeness well, remaining structured and complex through a mineral-driven finish."
US,91.0,50.0,Moon Mountain District Sonoma County,Y Rousseau,"Named for the producer's French grandfather, PÃ©pÃ© is peppery in clove and Mexican cinnamon, with an abundance of black cherry. Made in small amounts, it shows a softness around its rounded edges of structure and moderate body of acidity, finishing with length and grace."
US,89.0,48.0,Livermore Valley,Nottingham Cellars,"A rich, concentrated Livermore Valley Bordeaux blend, comprised of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser percentages of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. This vintage of Supremacy has a big presence, smelling of earth and cinnamon, a layering of blackberry and chocolate lingering in the background. A wine with great texture and mellowing tannins ready to drink now or in 5?? years."
Australia,83.0,10.0,South Eastern Australia,Andrew Peace,"This light- to medium-bodied Shiraz is crisp and tart, yet also shows some dried-fruit character on the finish."
US,87.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Mira,"This wine is blessed with velvety texture and bombastic ripeness, which leaves its plum and cherry fruit feeling baked and prune-like. The brawny fruit profile is accented with leather, tobacco and black pepper, finishing with a touch of heat."
Italy,91.0,52.0,Barolo,Giacosa Fratelli,"This is a sharply focused expression of the Bussia cru with a steady delivery of wild berry, underbrush, sour cherry, white mineral, anise and ginger. The aromatic intensity is understated but refined and the wine performs with the same elegance in the mouth. Age this wine for another five to eight years."
Italy,90.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Livio Sassetti,"The 2006 Pertimali tastes better than the 2006 Riserva and the 2007 Brunello. This wine is uniquely characterized by bold freshness and richness showing the clean and precise quality of Sangiovese fruit. The aftertaste is long, spicy and firm. Give this wine 5??0 more years."
France,84.0,13.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Lauduc,"A wine that is bright, fruity and light in character. The crisp apples and juicy lemon flavors are brightly lit by acidity and a hint of a more steely texture. Drink now."
US,85.0,24.0,New York,Waters Crest,"Intense aromas of day lilies, honey and spiced canned peaches abound in this not quite ?dry??Riesling. The mouth feels a bit confected with so much sunny orange marmalade and lemondrop flavors, but the finish ends drier with a hint of bitter orange pith."
Italy,90.0,32.0,Franciacorta,Montenisa,"Loads of peach and honey open the nose of this creamy, rich Chardonnay-based sparkling wine. In the mouth, the wine delivers sharp acidity and piquant effervescence."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Trento,Altemasi,"Here's a fun refreshing sparkler that offers delicate scents suggesting red berry and a whiff of candied citrus zest. The lively palate offers strawberry, red currant and apple alongside tangy acidity. It finishes clean and crisp."
Argentina,91.0,20.0,Mendoza,Casarena,"This is a rich, plush Cabernet, with a sense of elegance. It smells like prune, blackberry, coffee and toast. The concentrated palate boasts prune, olive, coffee and dark berry flavors. Drink or hold for a few years."
Argentina,88.0,30.0,Mendoza,Sur de los Andes,"Spunky dark fruit aromas open the show, with leather, cheese and mocha coming in later. The palate is a little grabby and acidic, but the juicy flavors of plum, wild berry, citrus and cassis are good. Finishes with some bounce in its step due to full acidity, and overall it maintains freshness and zest. Malbec with smaller doses of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot."
US,85.0,11.0,California,Bogle,"This is a fine Petite Sirah at this price, good for everyday fare like pizza or barbecue. It's dark in color, dry, tannic and stuffed with juicy blackberry and currant fruit."
US,91.0,20.0,Alexander Valley,Souverain,"This is a beautiful Cabernet, and at this price, a super deal. It's dry and soft, with the dusty tannins and herbal flavors that mark Alexander Valley Cab. But you'll find rewarding notes of blackberries. A great job from this veteran winery."
France,91.0,25.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Jean Rijckaert,"This tangy, perfumed single-vineyard wine also has some ripe fruit. A zesty character dominates at this early stage, leaving room for richer yellow fruits to come through in time. The wine has good potential, so wait until 2017 to drink."
Argentina,86.0,23.0,Mendoza,Cruzat,"Citrus and stone-fruit aromas struggle to hold up, while the palate on this blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay is solid but soft. Flavors of apple cider, peach juice and yeasty bread shift to powdered sugar and white table grapes on the finish."
Spain,86.0,8.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Capa,"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Heron Hill,"Ripe forward notes of apricot, tangerine and berry on the nose gain restraint on the palate of this dry Riesling. Tart lemon-lime acidity and earthier notes of dust and pollen add to its subdued style. The crisp tangerine finish is long and refreshing."
Argentina,89.0,25.0,Uco Valley,Monteviejo,"This Malbec-led blend opens with inky, hard-packed aromas of black fruits and grilled meats. The palate is on the rough and tough side, while flavors of ripe black fruits are intertwined with strong oak and spice. Overall, this is ripe, bold and heavy."
Spain,90.0,24.0,Jumilla,Casa de la Ermita,"The blackberry, boysenberry and cinnamon aromas are exotic and attractive. It offers a ton of body in support of concentrated flavors of black fruit, fudge and spice. The finish is long, with notes of chocolate, pepper and some elegance."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Isola dei Nuraghi,Agricola Punica,"Elegant and tight, this blend offers savory tones of cured meat and dried fruit, followed by green notes of curry leaf and herb. The wine is tangy, thick and persistent on the palate."
Spain,85.0,14.0,Rioja,Bodegas Valdemar,"Quite ripe on the nose, such that raisin and sweetness are front and center. Saturated in the mouth, but as a whole it's a bit flabby and, for the most part, it's neither here nor there. Flavors of plum and berry tilt to the dark side, while the finish is short but inoffensive."
Italy,90.0,52.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Montresor,"This offers aromas of candied cherry, cake spice, charred earth, cured meat and a whiff of underbrush. On the rich palate, notes of vanilla and black pepper accent chocolate covered cherry, raspberry and raisin accompanied by velvety tannins."
France,89.0,19.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de Gaudou,"With 14 months oak aging, this structured, spicy wine shows considerable toast. A strongly smoky character is freshened by the red currant and blackberry fruitiness. Acidity gives the wine a lift and also promises aging. Drink from 2017."
US,91.0,42.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"Gloria Ferrer's 2005 dry Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were both really good, so why shouldn't this bubbly blend of them be? And so it is. Rich in raspberry, lime, vanilla cream, yeast and cinnamon spice flavors, it has a complex, silky texture, with very fine bubbles. Drink now."
US,94.0,110.0,Howell Mountain,Lamborn Family Vineyards,"So dramatically deep in flavor, it immediately impresses for the depth of blackberries, cassis and minerals, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are fierce now, and the wine shows a precocious immaturity that makes it somewhat coarse. But it clearly has the structure to age well. Should glide through the next dozen years with ease. Production was 875 cases."
Spain,90.0,17.0,Toro,Vetus,"This wine's ripe plum and berry aromas feature an oaky note of bacon. On the palate, it's choppy and aggressive with tannic bite. Dark fruit flavors are bolstered by oaky spice, tobacco and chocolate hints that persist long on the finish. A texbook Toro wine."
US,85.0,20.0,North Fork of Long Island,Sannino,A touch of spritz lends verve to pressed apple and spice notes in this light-footed Chardonnay. It's slim and a bit simple on the palate but finishes refreshingly crisp. Drink now.
US,84.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,JCB,"Crisp and spicy, this blush has slightly sweet flavors of raspberries, red currants, lavender and vanilla."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Lugana,Perla del Garda,"Aromas suggesting Anjou pear, almond, grilled herb and a whiff of smoke come together in the glass while the palate offers tangerine zest, ginger and mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance."
US,86.0,35.0,Amador County,Renwood,"An austere, savory Zin from Amador, one of the smaller-production Zinfandels from Renwood and it shows. Firm tannins, dusty black fruit and spice?a good option for Sierra Foothills Zin fans."
US,87.0,17.0,Monterey County,Chloe,"Plump red cherry and red cranberry meet with touches of anise, sagebrush, cola and purple flowers on the nose of this smartly priced bottling. Strawberry candy, smashed herbs and more anise show once sipped, framed by lots of acidity."
Argentina,93.0,140.0,Mendoza,Achaval-Ferrer,"Piercing blueberry and wild berry aromas are prototypical of this label. A juicy, high-acid palate is linear and a bit edgy, but its composition bodes well for the future. Spiced plum and currant flavors finish with toast, spice and berry notes. Drink through 2024."
US,87.0,25.0,Yolo County,Rosenblum,"It's pure Rosenblum, as sweet as a confection, as delicious as a filling made from blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla and white sugar. It's impossible not to be impressed and troubled by a wine such as this."
France,90.0,50.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,ChÃ¢teau Mont-Redon,"Weighty, warm and welcoming, this is an easy-to-like wine with surprisingly delicate aromas of citrus blossom, tangerine and pineapple. Citrus and honey flavors form the bulk of the rich palate, lingering on the finish."
US,87.0,10.0,California,Grand Pacific,"A creamy, buttery texture wraps around a core of bright lemon and apple flavors. This is balanced slightly toward sweetness as the luxurious viscosity carries the vivid flavors into the finish."
France,92.0,80.0,Alsace,Cave du Roi Dagobert,A tender subdued nose gives hints of honeysuckle and ripe mirabelles. The medium-sweet palate lets the stone fruit speak even louder but a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides a frame for the juicy sweetness. This is rich and generous and has a lovely tang of tangerine on the warm finish.
Spain,88.0,13.0,Bierzo,Cuatro Pasos,"This fresh MencÃ­a's bright red fruit aromas exude rocky mineral tones. Raw, popping red plum and cherry flavors finish herbal and tomato-like, with a bit of tannic bite. Drink now or any time through 2021."
US,85.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cave B,"Stainless steel fermentation has yielded a yeasty, beery wine. There's plenty of fruit, a bit too reminiscent of canned peaches, and a finish that seems constricted and short. Residual sugar is right around 2%."
Italy,89.0,35.0,Toscana,Tenuta San Vito,"Here is an organic Merlot with well-integrated spice, fresh fruit nuances and natural rubber (a tiny touch of Band-Aid is present as well). Soft tannins and a velvety mouthfeel give the wine a sophisticated edge, and its dusty tannins give it the structure to stand up to grilled meat."
US,90.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Spring Valley Vineyard,"The aromas pop on this wine, with generous notes of white pepper, jalapeÃ±o pepper and herbs. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, showing a very pretty styling."
US,86.0,35.0,Sonoma Valley,Ridge,"Tastes too sweet by far, with sugared black cherry, currant, prune and tobacco flavors. The sweetness may be partially attributed to high alcohol. With thick tannins, this Zin is just too rustic to merit a higher score."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Basilisco,"This fragrant red opens with lovely scents of perfumed berry, blue flower and Oriental spice while the polished palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, anise and clove. Fine-grained tannins give the finish grip."
US,88.0,36.0,Umpqua Valley,Paul O'Brien,"Fermented in 1200-liter French oak casks, this seems a bit stark, with tangy raspberry fruit and a suggestion of wet stone minerality. It's tightly wound, crisply defined, immaculately fresh and good to go now through 2020."
France,88.0,25.0,MÃ¢con-FuissÃ©,Christophe Cordier,"This wine is spicy, fruity and immediately attractiv with ripe yellow fruits as well as acidity and zesty lime. Balanced and refreshing, this lively wine is ready to drink."
Argentina,84.0,19.0,San Juan,Graffigna,"Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry. The palate is chunky and clampy, with jammy, overly broad black fruit flavors that finish on the stewed and herbal side. Concentrated, massive and clumsy."
Italy,84.0,23.0,Emilia,Quarticello,"Made using an aromatic clone of Malvasia, this is a slightly sweet sparkler that would work beautifully with appetizers or tapas. It shows a light hay color and aromas of peach and honey."
France,88.0,42.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Sylvaine et Alain Normand,"This is a smooth, rich wine, full of tropical mango and pineapple flavors, with the lightest touch of acidity. Drink this superrich wine now."
Spain,81.0,18.0,Rioja,Bodegas Escudero,"Almond candy and lacquer aromas create a corny scent on the nose. This wine feels flabby and soggy, with buttery oak and little to no fruit flavor. Finishes woody, with vanilla and spice. A blend of 60% Viura and 40% Chardonnay."
Italy,95.0,103.0,Barolo,Michele Chiarlo,"An exciting flagship wine from one of the best producers in Piedmont, this is dark, inky and penetrating. It offers beautifully intense aromas of cassis, dried forest berry, ginger, cola, leather, and cedar. On the palate, it shows an incredibly silky and long quality. Hold for 10??0 years."
Spain,93.0,89.0,Priorat,Cims de Porrera,"Modern and bulky, this has a lot of great things going on. It opens with aromas of mineral, graphite, sage and bold berry, with chewy, roasted black-fruit flavors. It's long, compact, chocolaty and spicy on the finish. Still not mature but it's drinkable?best from 2014 and on."
Italy,90.0,115.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Campogiovanni,"Big and powerfully structured, this opens with aromas evoking truffle, sunbaked earth, fruitcake, iris and a whiff of game. The round meaty palate shows raspberry compote, fleshy morello cherry, clove and a hint of nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the finish. Drink through 2023."
US,91.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ott & Murphy,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Petit Verdot and 9% Merlot. The PV shows through in the ripe, textural tannins. The concentrated berry and cassis fruit is annotated with barrel notes of vanilla, coffee and tobacco. This is a hand-crafted wine with distinctive, albeit somewhat rustic, appeal."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Maremma,Poggio Mandorlo,"This blend exhibits thick density and concentration and direct aromas of blackberry, black ink, cola and roasted chestnuts. The wood is well-integrated, and the wine is juicy and firm on the palate. Drink after 2010."
Australia,88.0,14.0,South Australia,2 Up,"A warm, inviting wine, with scents of brown sugar, plum and baking spices. The tannins are creamy-soft, imparting a lush texture, balanced by just enough acidity to keep it from being thick or cloying. Finishes with plenty of fruit, plus a dash of chocolate."
US,95.0,50.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Melville,"Plump yet bright with fruit, suave yet spicy with herbs and gamy elements, this bottling shows candied cherry and cranberry alongside sage, eucalyptus and slight barnyard notes. The same juicy red fruit immediately elevates the palate, which is then leveled by lively Mediterranean spice and a buoyant acidity."
US,85.0,17.0,California,Sharabella Wines,"The label says California but these grapes are from Clarksburg, near Lodi and for Pinot Noir, leave a little to be desired. Mostly fruit, the wine's aromas and flavors are fairly simple and oaky. There's not much saying Pinot Noir specifically here."
Argentina,92.0,23.0,Mendoza,Fabre Montmayou,"Opaque to the eye, this is rich, heady and full of inky blackberry aromas and notes of graphite, balsam wood, tobacco and coconut. A lush, mile-deep palate offers chocolaty flavors of blackberry, roasted meat and salt. Ripe black-fruit flavors dominate a lush finish. Drink through 2020."
US,90.0,60.0,Oak Knoll District,Trefethen,"This wine is expansive and juicy on the palate. A tight grip shows its youth while the underlying softness on the texture reflects the relative coolness of the growing spot. It imparts Napa's robust ripeness in its depth of cassis, chocolate and black pepper."
France,89.0,24.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Rounded and honeyed, this is a wine that shows a sweeter side of Pinot Blanc, buoyed by fresh, juicy white-peach flavor. Full, rich and dense, this is fruity, yet it has a complex structure."
Italy,92.0,100.0,Etna,Pietradolce,"Made entirely with old Nerello Mascalese vines between 80 and 100-years-old, this has aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak. The elegant linear palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, chopped herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish. Drink 2018??025."
US,89.0,55.0,Bennett Valley,Talisman,"Earthy sage and black licorice invite one into this dark brooding expression of the grape, defined in exotic blackberry, black cherry and smoke. Medium bodied and softly smooth, it impresses in its brush with the dark side."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Siduri,"Shows fine Siduri character, a silky, dry wine with pleasant Pinot Noir flavors of cherries, currants, mocha and cola. Doesn't have the weight or density of the winery's single-vineyard wines, but the price is right."
US,90.0,36.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mounts,"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone."
Spain,85.0,25.0,Rioja,CVNE,"Stalky, short aromas suggest that this is raw and underripe. The palate feel confirms that impression; it's tight and choppy, with drying tannins. Roasted, gritty flavors of red fruits come with a sprinkle of cocoa, while the finish is tough in feel, spicy and ultimately mildly bitter."
US,91.0,32.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish."
US,85.0,11.0,California,Fleur de Lyeth,"A useful Bordeaux-style blend, dry and tannic, with blackberry, blueberry and chocolate flavors that finish sweet and spicy."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Langhe,SocrÃ©,Here's a fun and slightly less formal expression of Nebbiolo (especially when compared to the great wines of Barbaresco and Barolo) that offers tight fruit nuances of white cherry and forest berry backed by light shadings of spice and smoke.
US,89.0,27.0,Rogue Valley,J. Scott Cellars,"Here is a full-throttle mouthful of brambly berry fruit, with generous accents of dried herb and underbrush. The melding of fruit and herb is perfect, with clean, polished tannins."
France,92.0,197.0,Alsace,Hugel,"Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 GewÃ¼rztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis."
US,86.0,18.0,Central Coast,Calera,"Ripe, exotic papaya, mango, apricot and tangerine flavors highlight this wine. There's also plenty of buttered toast notes, but it's balanced with brisk acidity. This is a fine wine for drinking now."
US,80.0,14.0,California,Heavyweight,"Excessive sweetness mars this wine, making the blackberry flavors dull."
France,85.0,20.0,Sancerre,Domaine Roger Champault,"A caramel aroma sets the scene for a ripe, smooth wine. It has ripe red fruits that have a nutty, toasty character that balances with the crisp acidity and tight texture. Drink now."
France,87.0,19.0,Alsace,Domaine Bernhard & Reibel,"Lemon and green apple are the chief flavors of this easy Riesling that provides honest and uncomplicated refreshment. It finishes dry, with a fresh, lemony aftertaste."
US,82.0,10.0,Mendocino County,Castle Rock,"A low-price, high-production Merlot from Mendocino County grapes that smells musky and tastes a bit bland."
Spain,90.0,19.0,MÃ¡laga,Jorge OrdÃ³Ã±ez & Co.,"Don't let the near nonexistence of color fool you, because this is a nice racy-sweet Moscatel. Aromas of citrus peel and air freshener are mild, while this feels juicy. Tropical fruit and citrus flavors finish lean except for a touch of viscosity."
France,90.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,ChÃ¢teau Henri Bonnaud,"Organic grapes grown on limestone close to Mont Sainte-Victoire have produced a wine that is tight, mineral and ripe. The texture and the structure suggest a wine for food. Plenty of juicy red fruits in the background give weight and richness to the wine and to its peppery aftertaste."
US,90.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Bacio Divino,"Plum aromas are pounded home with notes of meat and menthol. When you next hear the word ?opaque,??think of this. But the body is surprisingly svelte, and the flavors emphasize red fruit. Some tannins are manifested on the finish, which shows licorice and buttery oak."
US,91.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Angelo Cellars,"Like so many wines from this site, this is explosive and powerfully rich, yet a lurking acidity keeps it fresh and in check. Notes of cedar, dried herb and pencil shavings meet integrated oak and firm tannin, as brambly blackberry and blueberry flavors linger with clove-tinged spice on the finish."
France,86.0,13.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Les Vignerons de Tutiac,"This is a strongly herbal wine. Its acidity and crisp texture give it great lift, bringing out lively fruitiness and a green fruit aftertaste. Drink now."
US,89.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"About 5% Viognier is blended into this spicy, round and fruity Pinot Gris. Complex and lively flavors suggest lemon and orange peel, melon, pear, and a hint of vanilla."
Italy,93.0,35.0,Collio,Mario Schiopetto,"There is an amazing medley of aromas and flavors in this powerful Tocai. Aromas of perfumed spring blossom, almonds follow through on the palate with flavors of pears, almonds and spice, with just a touch of pepper."
Argentina,91.0,79.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Trivento,"Dark in color, then jammy on the nose, this oaky specimen has heavily extracted berry aromas. In the mouth, there's a level of freshness offset by heavy fruit content. Flavors of berry and plum are chocolaty up front and finish with spice, pepper and additional chocolate richness. Drink through 2018."
US,87.0,18.0,Rutherford,Frog's Leap,"Shows the winery's characteristic green, tart gooseberry flavors and zesty acidity. There's a richer streak of grapefruits and pineapples. It's an elegant wine whose low alcohol, below 13%, doesn't prevent it from being dry."
US,89.0,28.0,Washington,Coeur d'Alene,"Vanilla, coconut and baking-spice aromas are out in front of dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors show vibrancy, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the long finish."
US,89.0,45.0,Dundee Hills,Torii Mor,"Six barrels?one each from six vineyards?comprise this cuvÃ©e. It's soft and silky, with pretty cherry fruit and a touch of herb. The finish continues smooth and supple, with a suggestion of caramel."
US,88.0,39.0,Monterey,Wrath,"Ripe fruit explodes in this wine, which swamps the mouth with crushed, jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Oak adds sweet buttered toast and smoke, but it's the fruit that really stars."
US,88.0,40.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foley,"Heavy sagebrush and chaparral spices meet with cherry fruit and a touch of asphalt on the nose of this bottling. The palate is earthy with loam and juniper flavors, all woven into dark cranberry fruit."
France,87.0,14.0,Bordeaux,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite),"A structured, firm wine showing a great balance of red fruits, dry Bordeaux-style tannins and a freshly jammy texture. For a branded Bordeaux, it has both quality and elegance."
US,93.0,54.0,Sonoma Coast,Keller Estate,"Named for the famous wine from France and similarly made by co-fermenting Syrah with Viognier, this cool-climate offering features a delightfully juicy backbone of red fruit and savory earth. Floral and spicy, it remains elegant on the palate and will take on additional nuance in the cellar. Drink now through 2020."
US,87.0,35.0,Carneros,B.R. Cohn,"This wine opens with a rich nose of graham cracker and a concentrated midpalate, which becomes full bodied and toasty in oak. Around a gravelly texture are flavors of green olive, brine and baked pear, a mix of savory and sweet that finishes with a dash of nutmeg."
US,90.0,80.0,Atlas Peak,Lobo,"Blended with smaller amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this mighty wine offers a depth and concentration of berry pie, chocolate and vanilla within a moderately structured amount of acidity. Bright cassis and currant add some freshness."
Italy,90.0,350.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,ZymÃ¨,"Blueberry, plum cake, mocha, vanilla and sweet pipe tobacco aromas jump from the glass of this mature, structured wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon and anisette back up primary flavors of dried black cherry and blackberry. Thanks to its smooth tannins, this would be nice to sip after dinner in front of the fire."
US,87.0,27.0,Carneros,X,"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle."
Italy,92.0,29.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Le Potazzine,"Structured but elegant, this weaves together sensations of tilled earth, forest floor, black cherry, raspberry, orange peel and nutmeg alongside supple tannins. It's vibrant and drinkable. Even though it will age moderately well, enjoy over the next few years to capture the fresh berry fruit."
US,89.0,45.0,Dundee Hills,Panther Creek,"This single-vineyard cuvÃ©e brings bold red fruit backed with steely minerality. After 14 months in 50% new French oak, the barrel flavors remain unintrusive, allowing pretty aromas of roses, raspberries, cherries and chocolate to emerge. It's drinking well already, and should continue to shine through 2026."
US,88.0,62.0,Paso Robles,Cass,"The nose on this bottling is quite complex and elegant, with black cherry syrup, cola, milk chocolate and sandalwood touches. The palate is more straightforward, with blackberry-balsamic sauce and black cherry fruit."
US,90.0,20.0,Long Island,Channing Daughters,"An intoxicating whiff of musky floral perfume persists throughout this bright, full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberry and white grapefruit flavors are tart and crisp, gaining plushness through the addition of Chardonnay in the blend. Elegant and substantial in mouth feel, it finishes long."
US,94.0,48.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sineann,"As good as varietal Petit Verdot gets, this delicious effort marries ripe red and black fruit to firm tannins streaked with minerals. It has the density and length of a cellar-worthy powerhouse, yet retains the elegance and balance to drink young."
Italy,90.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Casato1,"An inky-black appearance and spicy-savory aromas make this the kind of Brunello you want to drink on a really cold winter night. Tightly concentrated and extracted, with loads of black cherry, leather and tobacco, there are balsam notes too, but delivered in a big, strong fashion. The smooth, silky finish that is not overly dense or intense."
US,86.0,20.0,Seneca Lake,Belhurst,"Leesy, yeasty notes lend a savory feel to freshly-pressed apple and herb flavors in this easy-drinking Chardonnay. It's dry in style with a delicate mouthfeel that's accentuated by bright streaks of lemony acidity."
US,86.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Ledson,"Made in the slightly sweet, crisp popular style, this Sauvignon Blanc offers easy flavors of pineapple, pear and apple juice, with the sweet vanilla of oak."
US,90.0,15.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively."
Italy,90.0,21.0,Sicilia,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"A candied element of butterscotch, caramel and dried apricot opens the nose of this luminous and bright Chardonnay. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with enduring flavors of stone fruit and mineral (in fact, vineyard soils are heavy in chalk content). Baglio del Cristo is Sicily's hottest new winery to watch."
US,91.0,34.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"Give this wine a year or three in the cellar, unless you like your Pinots a little on the tough side. Tannins and earthiness currently dominate the polished raspberry and cherry flavors. If you do drink it now, decant for a few hours, but not overnight."
US,94.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs,"Quite a distinguished Cabernet. Shows its pedigree in ultra-refined tannins and an overall mouthfeel of lushness and finesse. Flavor-wise, it's all black currants, blueberries and sweet, smoky oak. Thirty-five dollars isn't cheap, but this is as good as it gets in this price bracket."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Collio,Russiz Superiore,"Heady aromas of cut grass, yellow stone fruit, dill and a hint of tomato leaf are showcased on this fragrant wine. The bright, focused palate delivers yellow peach, yellow apple, sage, saline and mineral note. Toasted almond signals the finish."
US,91.0,19.0,Napa Valley,Starmont,"Pretty in honeysuckle and gardenia, this bright wine, blended with 5% SÃ©millon, recalls fresh-squeezed lemonade before the sugar, refreshing and intensely delicious. The acidity is balanced by enough weight to dial the volume down and flavors of rich, lush melon."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Chianti Classico,Isole e Olena,"This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice."
Italy,92.0,80.0,Barolo,Amalia,"Roasted herb, moist underbrush, menthol, dark berry and vanilla aromas meld together in the glass. The ripe, chewy palate is full of juicy black cherry, dense raspberry, vanilla and cinnamon along with firm tannins and fresh acidity."
US,85.0,11.0,Sonoma County,Cline,Barrel toast and smoky gunpowder scents give this wine a savory edginess before revealing medium-bodied layers of baked blackberry and cherry.
US,87.0,18.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"Buttered toast, orange jam, vanilla, honey and yeasty flavors swirl together to make this easy-drinking Chardonnay. It has good acidity countering a lushness in the finish."
US,90.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Martin Ray,"Lemon pith and honey-vanilla provide substance to a floral, light and lingering wine also accented in melon that's food-friendly and refreshing."
US,84.0,35.0,North Fork of Long Island,Hargrave,"The dominant aromas are smoke, toast and cinnamon, which ride over tart-cherry fruit. Turns quite stemmy and tough on the finish. Drink young, with a piece of rare beef to help tame the tannins."
Spain,86.0,14.0,Ribera del Duero,O. Fournier,"Generic berry and plum aromas come with sweet vanilla notes and a briney pinch. The wine feels fresh but clacky, with juicy acids giving drive to standard dark cherry and berry flavors. Peppery and lightly oaked on the finish."
US,91.0,34.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan. The flavors aren't quite so mind-blowing, though, as basic fruit-punch elements meet with touches of peppercorn and nutmeg."
Italy,87.0,36.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Corte Lenguin,"Corte Lenguin's Amarone is less intense aromatically and laid-back in general with measured aromas of ripe fruit, resin, tar and mesquite. It offers more in the mouth however, in terms of density and taste, with a broad texture and bright cherry flavors."
US,86.0,55.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Bernardus,"This tastes and feels a little heavy and sweet, with prominent cherry candy flavors. It's quite tasty, but one-dimensional in its appeal. Drink now?it's hard to see it devloping much in the bottle."
US,90.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"No one in Washington makes better Semillon at this price. Dry and subtle, it benefits from blending with 10% Sauvignon Blanc, showing bright citrus rind, light toast, and excellent length."
US,87.0,26.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Crest,"Hailing from a single-vineyard block planted in 1979, this wine is aromatically reticent with notes of pear and flowers. It drinks off dry with stone- and tree-fruit flavors."
France,94.0,39.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"A touch of yeast still clings to the beautifully fresh apple nose of this wine while the palate still tingles with some residual carbon dioxide. This is rather young but the fruit is very pure in crisp green-apple notes and fresh, tangy lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and very taut and fresh. Some yeasty notes also swing along on the palate. This certainly needs bottle age but promises to become a lemon-scented, fresh and linear marvel. It certainly has bags of tension and freshness. The finish is bright, refreshing and utterly clean."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,Trivento,"While this Cab may be a touch soupy and heavy on the nose, aromas of coffee grounds and berry fruits are good. A full, blocky palate features cheek-rubbing tannins, while this tastes of coffee, chocolate and herbal berry fruits. For everyday purposes, this makes the grade."
US,92.0,52.0,Anderson Valley,Angel Camp,"Complex and tantalizing aromas of mint and cinnamon carry over to the palate, where bright plum, red cherry and floral tones linger through the finish. The texture is very smooth since the tannins and acidity are mild and well integrated."
Italy,89.0,12.0,Barco Reale di Carmignano,Fattoria Ambra,"Fruity aromas of wild berry meld together with whiffs of violet, tilled earth and dark spice on this young juicy red. The round savory palate doles out ripe black cherry, black berry, white pepper and a hint of licorice alongside supple tannins. It's easygoing and made to be drunk young so enjoy soon."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Cass,"This RhÃ´ne blend offers dried red cherry, boysenberry and rose petals on the inviting nose. The Grenache is a powerful player, contributing a rosewater touch to the palate, alongside cranberry, caramel and a touch of cola."
US,86.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Bynum,"Matchstick aromas are joined by a fleshy tropical character that defines this wine, which is aged in stainless steel drums, neutral French oak and a touch of new Acacia. Robust and ripe, it offers a boldness of vanilla and melon."
France,86.0,11.0,Beaujolais,ChÃ¢teau de Pizay,"This is ripe, full bodied and delicious, with a red fruit flavor. It has all the juicy fruitiness that is associated with Beaujolais. Drink now, even slightly chilled."
US,89.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Angel Vine,"The Hellion is half Primitivo, one-third Petite Sirah and the rest Zinfandel. A lively mix of berry, citrus and tree fruit flavors, it's plush, forward and full across the palate. It starts out beautifully, then falls a little flat coming into the home stretch. The finish shows some heat and a hint of milk chocolate."
US,93.0,150.0,Napa Valley,Black Stallion,"The producer's high mark for excellence, this opaque, thickly tannic wine begs for more time in the bottle. Bold, it hones in on a full-bodied weight of black raspberry, tobacco, cassis and black pepper. Complex, with touches of clove and dark chocolate, it can be enjoyed now, though it will cellar well through 2021."
US,87.0,13.0,Finger Lakes,Lamoreaux Landing,"A round, full character with ample layers of creamy spice and balanced acid recommend this elegant, more traditional Chardonnay from the Finger Lakes. The mouthfeel is full but poised, and the finish long."
France,85.0,13.0,Entre-Deux-Mers,ChÃ¢teau Vrai Caillou,"This wine is light and fruity, poised between rich tropical and herbal-laced green fruits. It has a perfumed touch from the Sauvignon Gris in the blend and a crisp texture. Drink from early 2018."
US,91.0,75.0,Rutherford,Frog's Leap,"Frog's Leap strove for elegance above power in this modulated, ageworthy wine. Tasted against bigger, riper Cabs, it's almost lean, with herb-infused red cherry, violet and mineral flavors, wrapped into complex tannins. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.6%. This is a connoisseur's wine, and it should develop for 10??5 years in a proper cellar."
US,89.0,15.0,Monterey County,Cameron Hughes,"This wine blends competing elements of steely minerality and ripe, nearly sweet elements of red apple and squeezed tangerine on the nose. The flavors are also well-rounded, with apple fruit and Asian pear balanced by lemon juice acidity."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Prosecco Treviso,La Jara,"La Jara?an organic Prosecco producer?has shown happy improvements in quality over the years. This expression is redolent of pink grapefruit, peach and Golden Delicious apple."
Argentina,86.0,13.0,Tupungato,Andeluna,"Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Nebbiolo d'Alba,Fontanafredda,"This medium-bodied Nebbiolo weaves together aromas of crushed raspberry, black cherry and forest floor that carry over to the firm palate along with notes of toast and tobacco. Chewy tannins provide the framework."
US,84.0,22.0,Sonoma County,Wellington,"Burnt, smoky char displays prominently on the nose of this wine, which is mouth-puckering with blackberry, current and pencil shaving flavors and finishes on bay leaf and sage."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Valpolicella Ripasso Valpantena Superiore,Tezza,"Here's a soft ripasso, with aromas of plum, raisin and menthol. The round palate offers plum, prune, black licorice and chocolate sensations. There's not much complexity here, but it's very enjoyable."
Italy,92.0,28.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Volpe Pasini,"Solid, luscious and silky smooth, this white wine from the northern Friuli region is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Pinot Bianco grape you'll find. Stone fruit and nutty tones are rich and penetrating and backed by more fruit and white flowers. Half the wine sees four months of oak to shape its creamy consistency and heightened complexity."
US,91.0,60.0,Chehalem Mountains,Lachini,"Bright, fresh raspberry fruit takes the center stage in this young and still rather tight wine that will reward further cellaring. There's a hint of metal in the acids. Drink 2020??030."
US,88.0,55.0,Paso Robles,Opolo,"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors."
France,93.0,500.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Domaine du Pegau,"This is a full-bodied, amply tannic red with an incredibly long, silky finish. It's also rather animale in style, boasting intense leather and beef jerky aromas and flavors that are smoky and meaty, while hints of liniment and horse tack grow stronger toward the finish. One to try?if possible?before committing to a purchase."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,Alamos,"Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character."
US,83.0,15.0,Paso Robles,Casa de Arcilla,"While this Tempranillo is straightforward in style, it does have some good cherry, herb tea and cola flavors. It's rich and soft, but has a pleasant burst of acidity."
Italy,94.0,106.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenute Silvio Nardi,"Austere and reserved with a dark side of exotic spice, anise and mature black fruit, Vigneto Manachiara is a savory, masculine and intense Brunello. In the mouth, the wine tastes dense, concentrated and opulent. This is a real crowd pleaser."
US,85.0,18.0,Napa Valley,Rutherford Ranch,"Flowery in aroma, this dry, balanced wine offers ripe flavors of melon and a touch of barrel.The finishis fleshy but abbreviated."
US,88.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Atwater,"Rich and juicy with aromas of preserved peach, fresh apple and even a hint of berries, this Riesling is dry in style, yet remarkably forward with fruit. The palate is bright, with zesty lemon-lime acidity that lingers on a medium-long finish."
Italy,92.0,55.0,Toscana,Castellare di Castellina,"Here's a masterpiece Sangiovese (with 15% Malvasia Nera) that shows a plush, rich nature and loads of fruity aromatic intensity. The wine is smooth, penetrating and long-lasting."
US,92.0,62.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"Acidity marks this fresh, young wine, giving a tension to the mouthfeel, and suggesting some time in the bottle to round it out. The underlying flavors are exquisite, suggesting cherries, raspberries, strawberries, pomegranates, Dr. Pepper cola and spice. The pedigree is obvious from the refined mouthfeel."
US,92.0,39.0,Livermore Valley,Occasio,"Bold and rich without feeling heavy, this luscious wine oozes with ripe blackberry and boysenberry fruit and has a mouth-coating, mouth-filling texture that keeps its flavors echoing through the finish. Occasio makes exceptional wines in small quantities."
US,87.0,23.0,Temecula Valley,Falkner,"Aromas of lemon-lime soda, chalk, underripe nectarine and kumquat show on the nose of this bottling from Southern California. Tangy citrus and a wet-cement minerality show through on the sip, where ripe Gravenstein-apple flavors trend toward sour stone-fruit rinds on the finish."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Avenue,"A bit herbal and brambly, with baked, earthy red fruit aromas. Modest raspberry flavors are mostly what you get off the narrow palate, and the finish follows suit as it fades out with a tight, herbal character. Rudimentary Cabernet."
France,90.0,50.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau LabÃ©gorce Margaux,"If Margaux is the most delicate of the MÃ©doc wines, then this is the epitome of Margaux. It is light, poised and attractively perfumed. The fruit is elegant and fresh with a fine streak of acidity."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Palagetto,"This opens with delicate aromas of acacia flower, ripe stone fruit and toasted nut that carry over to the straightforward palate along with yellow apple. It has the wine's signature bitter almond on the finish."
France,85.0,18.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Louis Max,"Honeyed and caramel aromas are followed on the palate by a ripe, rich creamy texture. Yellow fruits are further smoothed by buttery flavors. This is a rounded wine, ready to drink."
US,90.0,18.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Helwig,"Beautiful fruit flavors and a lively texture make a memorable impression in this medium-bodied, richly layered but also crisp and balanced wine. It tastes like sliced Pippin apples and Bosc pears, with pinches of vanilla and nutmeg."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Veneto,Albino Armani,"Herbal and citrusy, this is a cleanly made Pinot Grigio that offers a modicum of complexity. Pear and citrus flavors mingle with notes of bitter herbs. Finishes with a hint of bitter grapefruit pith but also lingering apple notes."
France,95.0,303.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Domaine Leflaive,"A rich wine, full and fruity up front, then opening up into a much more mineral, textured character. It is a great explosion of citrus, pear and green apple, the wood aging showing with subtlety. It's a wine for aging, complex and tight at the end."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Toscana,Rascioni e Cecconello,"Made entirely with Ciliegiolo grapes, this opens with fruity aromas of red raspberry and red cherry that carry over to the easy-drinking palate along with hints of vanilla and cinnamon. It's already accessible and enjoyable, with smooth tannins."
US,94.0,58.0,Sonoma County,Ferrari-Carano,"This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now??013."
France,92.0,80.0,Champagne,Roland Champion,"In perfect balance now, this is a great expression of mineral-driven Chardonnay. Its acidity is a vehicle for the crisp flavors of pear and lime, with a hint of ginger. It's still young, so drink it now for its great fruit, or age for four more years."
US,85.0,25.0,Carneros,Clos Pegase,"The oak contributes buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors to this dry, crisp wine, but the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support all that weight. Shows only modest flavors of pineapples, kiwis and minerals. Disappointing."
US,90.0,125.0,Stags Leap District,Silverado,"This is 100% varietal, from a heritage clone named for the owner and the winery, the Disney Silverado Heritage Clone. It contributes a dusty earthiness to the wine, a density and purity of fruit deep in dense blueberry and blackberry unctuousness. Cedar and graphite season it well, as firm, thick tannins fill up the finish."
Spain,89.0,49.0,Rioja,Beronia,"Inviting aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and rooty blackberry are a high point on this slightly hollow Rioja reserva. Plum, blackberry and citric flavors are short and tart, while the finish is light in step, with juicy acidity. This is solid for a 2008, a notoriously difficult vintage. Drink through 2024."
France,88.0,39.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine Saumaize-Michelin,"Round, smooth and rich, this full-bodied wine has ripe fruit and a balanced acidity. It is more about yellow fruits, less about citrus, conveying a generous character. It is likely to age quickly, so drink from late 2015."
France,94.0,455.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau Lafite Rothschild,"This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins."
US,91.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Rasa,"This wine is an unusual blend of Grenache (59%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%) and Syrah. It brings aromas of herbs and red fruit that lead to a full-bodied palate, chock-full of plump, ripe cherry and raspberry flavors, with the tannins giving a squeeze. It's a unique interpretation of these three varieties."
France,88.0,12.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de Bordes-Quancard,"The wine is full and ripe, generous both in its black fruits and its tannins. It's rich, juicy and packed with berry fruits, a touch of wood and a mineral texture showing at the end. Drink from 2016."
US,89.0,23.0,Napa County-Sonoma County,Ghost Pines,"Soft and delicious, this is for drinking now, with a certain elegant fanciness. The blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors are complex and worth repeated sipping."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Trentino,Maso Poli,"This rich Pinot Grigio sees some contact with oak barrel for a fuller, more generous mouthfeel. Aromas include honey, white almond, lemon zest and stone fruit."
US,86.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Beaucanon,"This wine has been in bottle a while, perhaps to round out its flavors components, which tend toward candied cherry and spice. Aged in American oak, the tannins remain tight-grained and the aromas focused, but the wine falls somewhat flat on the finish."
US,92.0,25.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gainey,"A beautiful Chardonnay, solidly in the Gainey style of balance and integrity, but also showing the cool climate terroir of its origins as well as the excellence of the vintage. The result is this crisp, richly oaked but balanced young wine. It brims with tropical fruits and spices."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Toscana,Renieri,"This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of black berries, cedar and spice with a hint of meat juices. The palate delivers dense black cherry and black berry flavors along with vanilla, espresso and chocolate notes. It's ripe, concentrated and velvety but it also lacks freshness and energy."
US,88.0,40.0,Finger Lakes,Fox Run,"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, Fox Run's Meritage highlights Merlot's rich, ripe black cherry flavor with Cabernet's taut acidity and herbaceous flair. It's rigidly tannic still, but should mature elegantly over the next 3?? years."
US,86.0,14.0,Clarksburg,Dancing Coyote,An earthy vein in the aromas and flavors keeps this wine from being a classic. Nonetheless it has ripe fruit flavors and a relatively smooth texture in spite of the variety's typical firm tannins.
France,86.0,19.0,Bourgogne,Simonnet-Febvre,Epineuil is a small area close to Chablis. This red wine is as light and fresh as its northerly location would suggest. Red cherry juice dominates an attractively textured wine that could be served slightly chilled.
Spain,90.0,26.0,Cava,Muga,"Leesy, yeasty apple and pear aromas are a touch funky yet sophisticated. Made in Rioja, so it's based on Viura, this is cushioned but zesty on the palate, with lively bubbles. It tastes complex and a touch sour, with notes of apple cider and apricot. Briny in flavor and solid in feel on the finish."
France,90.0,35.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau d'Esclans,"Time to rock with this new, lightly oaked cuvÃ©e from Esclans, a fresh, bright, full wine with forward fruit. Despite its alcohol, the wine has a light touch with a hint of pepper and rounded red fruits making it ideal for food. The wine will be best to drink from late 2016."
France,93.0,22.0,Tavel,ChÃ¢teau de SÃ©griÃ¨s,"This rosÃ© is mouthfilling and round, with ample melon and berry fruit, a sprinkling of dried spices and minimal herb notes. It actually drinks almost like a red wine for its weight and berry-scented richness, but remains refreshing on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now."
France,89.0,20.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Simonnet-Febvre,"This rich, fruity wine is packed with ripe apples and pears, and cut with delicious, full-on acidity. It's aromatic, with a lively mousse and a sparkling, lifted character. Drink now."
France,88.0,23.0,Alsace,Cave de RibeauvillÃ©,"Fresh lemony notes are signalled on the nose and fizz on the simple, fruit-driven palate. There is an element of creaminess but the frothing mouthfeel is all about refreshment and easy fruit."
US,90.0,70.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"This cuvÃ©e is made with the oldest WÃ¤denswil plantings at the estate. It's broadly fruity with delicious strawberry flavors front and center. Supporting acids are proportionate and fresh. Although relatively light, this elegant, graceful wine is ready for immediate enjoyment."
US,89.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Ousterhout,"Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange."
US,88.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"With buttered popcorn scents and flavors, underscored with pretty, toasty oak, this marries those flavors to a more restrained body, balanced with good acidity and showing fruit flavors of green apple and banana cream pie. Not a complex wine, but forward and flavorful."
US,94.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023."
Australia,87.0,12.0,South Australia,R Wines,"Like the D&J; Chardonnay, this is a readily approachable, easy-drinking wine with good varietal character. Cassis fruit dominates, accented by slightly herbal notes suggestive of mint. The tannins are supple, adding an appropriately dusty edge to the finish. Drink now??012."
France,85.0,15.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau Cailleteau Bergeron,"This soft, ripe wine by the Blaye sister-brother team of Marie-Pierre et Pierre-Charles Dartier has caramel flavors integrated into the red fruits. A crisp side comes from red currant flavors, while a smooth aftertaste keeps it rich while not losing the acidity."
France,90.0,40.0,Saint-Amour,Florent Descombe,"This wine comes from the most northerly of the Beaujolais cru villages as it merges gently in Burgundy's MÃ¢con region. The wine is structured and firm, but with bright red-cherry fruit and acidity. It will age and be best from 2018."
US,90.0,58.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"From single vineyard specialist Testarossa, this has fresh aromas of raspberry and a bit of eucalyptus. The flavors are very straightforward and pleasant, with cherry dominating. Dill, oregano and thyme provide herbal backbone."
US,88.0,18.0,California,Bread & Butter,"A hearty bottle of Chardonnay with the simplest label you could imagine, it emphasizes earthy, oaky, buttery flavors over fruit components. This is medium-bodied, dry, rich in texture and moderately tannic."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Nada Fiorenzo,"Rose, violet, mint, sun-baked earth and red berry aromas emerge on this elegantly structured wine. The firm palate offers mature wild cherry, white pepper, chopped herb and star anise while tightly wound but polished tannins provide support. Let the tannins unwind then enjoy. Drink 2018??026."
France,87.0,22.0,Chablis,Xavier Flouret,"Thierry Hamelin has produced this wine specially for the Xavier Flouret range. It is lightly perfumed with white-flower aromas and has a mineral texture and delicious, refreshing citrus flavors. Full of tangy fruit and acidity at the end, it is a wine to drink now."
US,89.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish."
France,93.0,58.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau la GaffeliÃ¨re,"A hugely concentrated wine, it has a dark feel to it, mineral and structured. It shows spice, suggestions of the wood aging and always the ripest fruit. Drink from 2018."
France,92.0,27.0,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,"A both heady and leafy swirl of passion fruit adds a tropical touch to the nose. The palate brims with sweetness and zesty passion fruit and grapefruit spice. The flavors are intense and the palate is medium sweet, aptly countered by lemon and passion fruit. This strikes a lovely balance and gives tons and tons of fruit and flavor."
US,90.0,32.0,Santa Barbara County,Comartin,"Grenache-focused Bay Area winemaker Adam Comartin adds 34% Syrah and 14% MourvÃ¨dre to this blend that delivers aromas of black pepper, blackberry and plum. There's viscosity on the palate, with blackberry fruits, violet florals, whiffs of vanilla and black rocks. The tight finish wipes the mouth clean."
US,85.0,12.0,California,Dancing Bull,"Citrus wafts up in the aroma, and brisk lemon, lime and grapefruit tinge the flavors of this wine. A rather soft texture and light body make it gentle to sip, and a touch of sweetness comes out on the finish."
Italy,90.0,75.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Tenuta Santa Maria alla Pieve,"Vintner Gaetano Bertani delivers a dark and delicious Amarone with bright fruit tones, loads of dried spice, leather and tobacco. The wine presents a soft, sweet sensation in the mouth thanks to its chewy tannins and fruity finish."
US,85.0,27.0,Paso Robles,Ben Hogan,"Soft and fruity, this easy-drinking Syrah has pleasant, jammy flavors of raspberries, blackberries, cola, bacon and peppery spices. It's a nice, full-bodied red wine to drink now with party food."
Italy,92.0,40.0,Montefalco Rosso,Antonelli,"Underbrush, violet, moist soil and spicy blackberry aromas unfold in the glass of this refined, full-bodied wine. The delicious palate offers crushed dark cherry, raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. It ends on a mocha note. Drink through 2018."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Veneto,La Villa,Here's a fun and fresh Italian Pinot Grigio with piquant aromas of citrus and peach. The wine is informal and easy-drinking. A good food pairing would be chicken salad or lightly roasted fish. Screwcap.
Italy,89.0,12.0,Bardolino Chiaretto,Gorgo,"A blend of Corvina Veronese, Rondinella and Molinara grapes, this savory rosato offers red cherry, white pepper and nutmeg flavors alongside tangy acidity. A saline note energizes the tangy finish. It's straightforward but savory, with a hint of fennel on the close."
Italy,93.0,138.0,Toscana,Jacopo Biondi-Santi,"With eight years of age on it, this wine is at a beautiful point in its evolution with delicate elegance, refined perfumes and special accents on cinnamon, mineral tones and bright fruit. It's sophisticated and persistent, with silky tannins and sweet spice on the close."
US,93.0,52.0,Anderson Valley,Barnett,"Barnett is better known as a producer of very good Cabernet. But their Chardonnays can be great, and so can  their Pinot Noirs. This single-vineyard bottling has the elegance of the best Anderson Valley Pinots, a dry, crisp wine of great complexity. The flavors of cherries, licorice, Dr. Pepper, sweet Chinese tea and bacon are delicious and compelling."
US,83.0,12.0,Sierra Foothills,Perry Creek,"A peppery nose, tart wine, with plenty of acid, perhaps too much acid. The mouthfeel is awkward, unbalanced, and the finish is odd. It tastes over-manipulated."
US,83.0,20.0,Virginia,Tarara,"Stewed berries mix with sweet spice aromas of anise and vanilla on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Tannat. The light-bodied palate is streamlined and focused on watery strawberry and red cherry flavors riding over underripe green notes."
US,86.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Ventosa,"Scents of smoke and sweet roasted chestnuts add a warm, rustic tone to this medium-dry Riesling. Deeply concentrated, with ripe yellow peach and apricot flavors, it's brightened by a shower of lemonade acidity and a snappy lemon-rind finish."
US,87.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Underground Wine Project,"This wine is 90% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of plum, smoke, orange peel and dried fruit are followed by a sweet full-bodied palate. It packs a big wallop but could use a bit more acid to balance out the abundance of fruit."
US,89.0,30.0,Paso Robles,San Simeon,"Elegant aromas of blackcurrant and black cassis combine with German-chocolate cake and concentrated violet oil scents on the nose of this bottling. It is soft and full on the palate, where mouth-coating tannins present flavors of earthy loam, black cherry and hint of burnt caramel on the finish."
US,91.0,24.0,Santa Barbara County,Consilience,"This is a big wine on the nose, with lemon curd, vanilla cream, hot pie crust and white and yellow flowers mixing into a very lush invitation. The palate shows great restraint, though, with lemon peels and pudding balanced by a tight line of lime pith."
US,92.0,28.0,Chalone,Flywheel,"Crushed lilacs, raw beef, dried tobacco and leather combine with very earthy and rocky aromas of potting soil on the deeply layered nose of this bottling from a vineyard on the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The palate combines rusty earth, dried sagebrush and dill with blackberry jam and blueberry jelly, with a serious savory boost into the finish."
US,92.0,48.0,Santa Maria Valley,Alta Maria,"Winemakers James Ontiveros and Paul Wilkins tease awesomeness out of the legendary Bien Nacido Vineyard with this Pinot Noir?and Ontiveros should know how, since he worked for the vineyard for years. On the nose, there's sea salt, caramel, cotton candy and pepper-teriyaki steak. Although it's leaner on the palate, it still features ripe raspberries, milk chocolate and sweetened coffee."
Australia,87.0,25.0,McLaren Vale,Yangarra Estate Vineyard,"Despite some very ripe fruit flavors and ample (14.5%) alcohol, this full-bodied Shiraz isn't particularly lush. The tannins are rich and velvety, but the acids are elevated and tartness dominates the finish. Drink it over the next several years."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Piave,Astoria,"Here's a simple, straightforward Cabernet Sauvignon from northern Italy with an attractively low price tag and lively aromas of cherry, chocolate and spice. It shows rich, dense texture as well."
US,86.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Still Waters,"This wine shows apparent barrel aging on the nose, with vanilla bean and coconut oil alongside caramelized apricot aromas. There is a very ripe papaya and guava tropicality on the palate, with a slight finish of iodine."
France,87.0,15.0,Buzet,ChÃ¢teau Tournelles,"This is a second wine of ChÃ¢teau Tournelles. Soft and generously ripe, it has attractive tannins that just give the bright fruit a support. The wine, a blend of Bordeaux grapes typical of this appellation, is ready to drink."
France,96.0,475.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc,"With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028."
France,92.0,26.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Patrice Moreux,"From one of the top vineyard sectors of Pouilly-FumÃ©, the wine is rich, full and complex. Spice and vanilla are contrasted with the intense acidity and steely white-fruit and citrus flavors. It is still young with its fruitiness bursting out of the glass. Wait until 2018."
US,86.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Rutherford Grove,"Made in an interesting way, with no oak but aged on the lees and put through malolactic fermentation. The result is crisp, clean and tasty, if a little sweet, with citrus, fig, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors."
France,85.0,24.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau du Taillan,"A juicy, fruity, soft wine, it has a gentle tannic character. Red berry flavors, soft acidity and fresh texture combine to give a light wine that will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2015."
France,90.0,40.0,Mercurey,Domaines Devillard,"Although this wine does not come from a premier-cru vineyard, it hails from a single vineyard that regularly produces delicious white wines. This bottling, rich as befits the year, also has an attractive bright, crisp edge that contrasts with the warm yellow fruits. Drink the wine from 2019."
Canada,88.0,25.0,British Columbia,Calliope,"Calliope is the second label of Burrowing Owl. This tight, toasty blend is comprised of 56% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 6% Syrah. Pinpoint fruit flavors of plum and cherry carry a pleasant saline note."
US,91.0,50.0,Santa Barbara County,JCR,"A very streamlined Chardonnay, this bottling from a vineyard southwest of the Sta. Rita Hills shows aromas of chalk, Meyer lemon slices, white flowers and apple pie crusted with almond and coconut flakes. Persistent acidity carries the palate into flavors of gravel, lemongrass, lime and lemon-lime."
US,90.0,19.0,North Coast,Bodkin,"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish."
US,91.0,60.0,Sonoma Valley,Ravenswood,"Bright, dusty leather is a highlight of this structured, meaty, balanced wine, firm and grippy in tannin. Red berry and coffee complement each other to find a tension between fruit and spice."
France,87.0,22.0,Chablis,La Chablisienne,"This is initially round and ripe, with a hint of vanilla, before showing a more structured, steely side. It shows fine balance between its intense texture and fruitiness, promising 2?? years of aging."
US,88.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Coelho,"Fermented in a mix of stainless steel barrels and neutral oak barrels, this was fermented with native yeast and given sur lie aging. It went through 100% malolactic fermentation, which has softened the mid-palate, a mix of lemon, grapefruit and Satsuma orange. There are still traces of phenolic bite, but those citrus rind flavors have been well rounded also, though this carries some heat in the finish."
US,85.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Knapp,"A distinct headiness to the gardenia blossoms that perfume this Riesling contrasts with the bright, tropical pineapple, candied fruit and tangerine flavors that dominate in the mouth. A touch of minerality and racy acidity round out the finish."
US,86.0,7.0,California,CK Mondavi,"This light-bodied wine brings enjoyment at a very low price. Attractive grapefruit and dried herb aromas followed by citrus and savory flavors make it appetizing and enjoyable. It tastes dry, fairly crisp and well balanced."
Italy,84.0,18.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Terlano,"This pale-colored get by with standard aromas of stone fruit, kiwi and passion fruit. Easy-to-drink and decidedly uncomplicated, it offers simple, fruit-driven flavors."
France,84.0,13.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Sauvion,"Lightweight fresh fruit flavors, mostly grapefruit and clean freshness. The wine is attractively fruity in style."
Italy,89.0,43.0,Alto Adige,Castelfeder,"This opens with aromas suggesting dark-skinned berry, ground pepper and a whiff of flint. The solid, chewy palate shows mature plum, espresso and vanilla alongside ripe, robust tannins. Drink through 2018."
US,82.0,13.0,Finger Lakes,Lucas Vineyards,"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges."
US,91.0,40.0,Central Coast,Sculpterra,"This blend of 47% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 23% MourvÃ¨dre packs dense fruit on the nose, showing plump blackberry and black plum, with touches of pepper, tar and charred beef. The palate is dry and leads with savory peppercorn and asphalt notes, then rounds out with blueberry and dried herb flavors, all balanced by spry acidity."
France,90.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau du Carrubier,This is a ripe rounded wine. It has generous apricot and red-berry fruits that are lifted by spice. The schist soil gives a mineral edge to the wine while the acidity in the background is just right to give this wine its crisp aftertaste. Drink this balanced wine now.
France,93.0,29.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"Red-cheeked apple peel and freshly-cut apple tart on the nose make for an irresistible opening. There is a bright, lemony streak of acidity at the core, cushioned by soft mousse and a soft background of yeasty autolysis. This is slender, taut and refreshing, with a completely satisfying chalky, stony background."
Australia,89.0,18.0,McLaren Vale,Longwood,"Espresso, blackberry and black olive flavors all come together on the palate of this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz. Hints of leather, plum, menthol and spice add complexity to the aromas, while only a touch of warmth on the finish from its 15% alcohol keeps this from an excellent rating. Drink now."
France,89.0,24.0,Alsace,Robert Karcher et Fils,"A lovely touch of smoke and earth plays around the honeysuckle and peach notes. The palate adds even more stone fruit: apricot and juicy mirabelle. They are boosted by some residual sweetness that makes for an easy, friendly and fluid palate. The finish is off dry, peachy and floral."
France,86.0,15.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Maison Bouey,"This is a soft, fruity 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon wine. With gentle tannins and red fruit flavors, it is developing well, becoming a juicy and fruity wine."
US,84.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Decoy,"This wine is uncomplicated in approach, light bodied enough to be food-friendly and approachable. It has notions of apple and tropical fruit at its core."
US,91.0,39.0,Willamette Valley,Scott Paul,"Scott Paul's largest production Pinot Noir is a nicely balanced, silky wine, fermented with wild yeasts and structured for elegance. Raspberry, black cherry, a touch of blood orange and a lick of molasses all contribute."
Italy,90.0,26.0,Chianti Classico,Volpaia,"Violet, iris, red berry and spice scents take center stage in this delicious blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot and Syrah. The bright, fruity palate delivers wild cherry, black pepper and cinnamon spice notes alongside assertive tannins and freshness."
US,89.0,23.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"Eberle has a consistent history with this bottling, always offering a refreshingly crisp, flavorful Viognier of great drinkability. This 2011 is their best in several years, with tropical fruit and white-flower flavors leading to a honeyed finish."
France,91.0,69.0,Beaune,Bouchard AÃ®nÃ© et Fils,"This is a juicy wine, packed with red fruits. It has acidity along with an edge of tannins. The attractive fruitiness suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2019."
France,92.0,96.0,Meursault,Pierre AndrÃ©,"With its initial toast flavors, this is a wine that is made for aging. It has weight and opulence to go with the structure and sweet fruits. The peaches combine with citrus in a delicious counterpoint to the structure. Age for 3?? years."
France,90.0,45.0,Champagne,A.R. LenobleÂ ,"Intense is a good description of this tightly textured and mineral-driven wine. Its fruit is subdued by the steely, tense character, although there are attractive hints of crisp apple and citrus acidity. The bottling is young and will repay several months aging after purchase."
Italy,87.0,28.0,Emilia,La Stoppa,"This is a dark and brooding blend of Barbera and Bonarda that veers towards tobacco, leather and tar to such a far extreme, the fruit is almost overwhelmed in the bouquet. Prune and cassis do make an appearance on the palate, and there's a ripe-fruit note on the close."
Italy,91.0,19.0,Sicilia,Donnafugata,"Vibrant and savory, this opens with lovely aromas of spring flower, citrus, herb and white stone fruit. The round, juicy palate offers ripe white peach, juicy grapefruit, pineapple and mineral alongside fresh acidity. A saline note backs up the finish."
US,89.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Tercero,"RhÃ´ne variety-focused winemaker Larry Schaeffer ventures into Bordeaux territory with this bottling, which he recommends served with a slight chill. Smooth berry aromas meet grapeseed and crushed plum on the nose. The palate is light, fresh and easy to enjoy, with red fruit and dried herb flavors, proving easy to quaff."
US,83.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cedar River Cellars,"A 50-50 Cabernet/Syrah blend, this is heavily tannic. The cherry-cola flavor is smothered in char, smoke and bitter espresso. This needs a big thick steak to cut through the tannins."
Italy,90.0,68.0,Valtellina Superiore,Arpepe,"Aromas of flint, pressed rose petal, dark spice and a light balsamic note delicately lead the nose. The slim palate is vibrant and smooth, offering sour cherry, crushed herb and a smoky mineral note framed in bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. Drink 2017??023."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Barbaresco,Rocca Felice,"Here's a cheerful but simple expression of Nebbiolo that opens with aromas of leather, dried fruit, earth and crushed white pepper. The tannins are smooth, fine and silky."
Canada,90.0,15.0,Okanagan Valley,Laughing Stock,"This wine may surprise you with its rich round full-bodied fruit. It's not the racy, high-acid style you might expect from a BC winery?rather it pumps up the flavors with pear, peach and papaya front and center, clean and fresh. Fermentation took place in a mix of oak, concrete egg and steel."
France,88.0,14.0,Bergerac,ChÃ¢teau les Peyroulets,"A ripe wine from a fine Bergerac vintage, this is balanced without being weighty. It is a blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, giving both a fine tannic structure and plenty of black-currant juiciness. Drink this wine from 2018."
Australia,88.0,30.0,Margaret River,Evans & Tate,"Conventional wisdom is that 2004 was a better Margaret River vintage than 2003, but this wine suffers a bit in comparison to its older sibling. Thankfully, it's still very good, with plentiful cassis and red plum fruit, soft tannins and crisp acids."
US,88.0,36.0,Carneros-Napa Valley,Uvaggio,"This is a bold combination of 89% Dolcetto from the Napa side of Carneros and 11% Barbera from one of its happy spots in the state, El Dorado County. Big bodied and tannic on entry, it softens in the glass to reveal bright red cherry and spearmint, with a touch of bitterness on the finish."
US,89.0,13.0,Clarksburg,Dancing Coyote,"Fans of inky black, tannicly thick and powerfully flavored Petite Sirahs will be dancing in the wine aisles over this one, from a smallish Delta appellation. It's bone dry, with intense black currant, chocolate, fig and smoky vanilla flavors, and should develop nuances for many years."
France,95.0,170.0,Champagne,MoÃ«t & Chandon,"With some age, this is a gloriously ripe and toasty wine. It has a rich character emphasized by the round texture and the creamy mousse. It also has great concentration, bringing together acidity as well as dense secondary flavors. With its rich, mature character, it is best suited for food. It is ready to drink, but will hold well through 2025."
Argentina,88.0,13.0,Cafayate,Michel Torino,"Lime and mango aromas stick out on an otherwise neutral, crisp bouquet. This is lean and well cut, with refreshing citric acidity. Flavors of pineapple, lime and green apple finish with zest and continuity. Drink now."
US,86.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Basel Cellars,"Herbal and tight, with a whiff of burnt rubber in front of some tart fruit. There is some concentration, and with more bottle age the wine may yet flesh out a bit."
US,91.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"Two-thirds Merlot with the rest made up of near equal parts of the other four Bordeaux varieties, this wine opens with aromas of toast, spice, plum, licorice, herbs and red and black fruit. The black-fruit flavors are fresh and exquisitely balanced, with a finish that persists."
Italy,87.0,36.0,Franciacorta,Berlucchi,"Berlucchi '61 RosÃ© is a fun and lively sparkler with berry, tropical fruit and toasted bread aromas. The palate delivers strawberry, pineapple and pastry notes and a dry walnut finish."
US,85.0,20.0,Dry Creek Valley,Alexander Valley Vineyards,"Dry, minty and sharp, and very peppery, with tobacco, wintergreen, cherry and currant flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Drink now."
France,87.0,24.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,"Offering attractive, tropical-fruit flavors, this wine is smooth and creamy. To balance that, a refreshing moment of tanginess gives a crisp shot of lemon. Drink from 2018."
US,88.0,36.0,Carneros,Acacia,"Crisp golden apple and pear meet toasted oak in both aroma and flavor in this simply structured, light-bodied white. While it remains crisp and mineral-driven on the midpalate, it lacks complexity on the finish, getting to its point succinctly."
France,86.0,25.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Haut Peyrefaure,"The wine is structured with concentrated tannins and dense fruit. It has spice, wood-aging flavors and a firm aftertaste. That means the wine needs time, so wait until 2019."
US,86.0,17.0,Swan Creek,Raffaldini,"Clove and pepper spice the dark red cherry aromas on this lovely Montepulciano. Judicious use of French oak makes for a smooth, full-bodied wine with rustic tobacco and smoke notes that highlight the wine's concentrated black fruit and sturdy tannins."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Tinedo,"Wiry, scratchy raspberry aromas are a touch herbal but stop short of veering toward green. This blend is full, rubbery and a touch sticky in feel. Flavors of blackberry, oak and mint finish with heavy tannins and a resiny, grabby feel."
Spain,90.0,15.0,Rioja,Finca Hispana,"Dry, spicy red-fruit and sawdust aromas are elegant. This is fresh, crisp and refined on the palate, with oak, plum, raspberry and tomato flavors that dry out and narrow down on a tight, well-framed finish."
US,89.0,25.0,Wahluke Slope,Milbrandt,"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine."
Australia,91.0,39.0,Tasmania,Josef Chromy,"Some whole-bunch fermentation is reflected in a vegetal hint on the nose, but otherwise this is a fruit-driven youngster, bursting with lively red berries. Hints of toasted coconut, vanilla and mocha from French oak add complexity to this medium-bodied, supple wine. The tannins firm up on the finish, suggesting mid-term cellaring; drink 2017??023."
US,90.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Clos du Val,"Softly balanced, this is an elegant wine, with less than a handful of Petit Verdot that exhibits savory dried cranberry and plum around larger elements of juicy plum and dark chocolate. It never veers bitter or green, staying juicy and supple on the palate."
Italy,91.0,43.0,Chianti Classico,Ruffino,"Aromas of violet, iris, forest floor, woodland berry and allspice lead the nose on this structured, savory wine. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry, mocha, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's firm and well balanced."
US,86.0,28.0,Temecula,Ponte,"A pleasing shade of pale pink, this is a very austere bottling, with just faint touches of raspberry and tangerine on the nose. There is more light-red fruit and a hint of bubblegum on the palate, which offers decent tannic tension."
US,87.0,24.0,Horse Heaven Hills,W.T. Vintners,"Fermented with 30% whole clusters and aged 20 months in neutral French oak, this is a distinctive wine with notes reminiscent of sage along with white pepper, violets and a tinge of copper. Designed for the dinner table, the palate is lighter in style with tart acidity."
US,86.0,30.0,Santa Ynez Valley,KitÃ¡,"Asphalt, sour berries and purple flowers show on the nose of this brawny wine by winery owner, Tara Gomez, a descendent of the Chumash tribe. The rigid tannic structure on the palate allows only thicker espresso bean and more tar flavors to emerge."
US,87.0,45.0,Applegate Valley,Cowhorn,"Syrahs can be exceptional at this biodynamic estate, but this one is merely good. Tight and herbal, it shows traces of blackberry fruit, but the earthy components dominate. It was fermented with roughly two-fifths whole clusters, and spent nine months in 40% new French oak."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Ca' Rugate,"This opens with bright fruit notes of blueberry and wild cherry, followed by savory touches of exotic spice and green tea. It offers heft and endurance without the chewy thickness found in some Amarone."
US,91.0,32.0,Amador County,Fiddletown Cellars,"This wine has that warm, spicy, friendly feel of new oak that is well integrated with the fruit flavors, and a velvety texture to match. It smells like toasted baguette, nutmeg and vanilla and tastes almost as rich as blackberry jam, but stays dry and full-bodied. It's so easy to enjoy."
France,85.0,14.0,Vin de France,Tussock Jumper,"This is a smooth, soft, gently fruity wine, immediately drinkable. An attractive buttery, honeyed character comes from this warm-climate Chardonnay. Yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity at the end. Drink now."
US,87.0,8.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A popular style, fruity and forward, with the emphasis on citrus, grapefruit and apricot, rather than floral qualities. Sweet fruit set against tangy acid makes it a versatile food wine too."
US,88.0,11.0,Mendocino County,Parducci,"A light-golden Chardonnay that does its county proud. It's lively and bright, with medium weight and flavors of sweet lemon custard, apple, and a lime-zest-dominated finish. This is a very good wine at a very fair price that should pair with an assortment of dinner fare."
France,89.0,48.0,Champagne,Joseph Perrier,"The nonvintage cuvÃ©e from Joseph Perrier is a soft wine that is smooth and ripe. It is easy, balanced and crisp while also having rounded white fruit flavors and a soft aftertaste. This bottling, poised between freshness and maturity, is ready to drink."
US,88.0,29.0,Russian River Valley,McKahn,"This is an elegant, pretty, lightly oaked white that's stony and savory with lemongrass, nutmeg and a strong crunch of green apple. Its depth of body and ripeness complement its more exotic elements."
France,92.0,91.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Tardieu-Laurent,"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvÃ©e flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?"
US,83.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Sebastiani,"Aged in stainless steel, this faint SB is herb-y and slightly grassy. Sweetness on the midpalate sticks around before the quick finish."
US,92.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Watermill,"From the beguiling aromatics to the thrilling palate that's saturated with flavors of citrus flesh and rind, tangerine and green apple, this Viognier offers superb focus. The length and detail are noteworthy, but the taste is simply delicious."
France,91.0,36.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau Kirwan,"Black fruits dominate this second wine of Kirwan, an 1855 Third Growth Grand Cru ClassÃ©. The oak aging is subtle and gives a smooth character rather than strong toasty flavors. The richness and structure do promise some aging although this wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2020."
US,93.0,55.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Betz Family,"A fine effort in this cool vintage, this Merlot-dominated Bordeaux-style blend is aromatically arresting, with complex flower and herb scents suggesting appealing delicacy. It delivers that in a focused, wine with pretty berry and chocolate flavors."
US,91.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"A blend of Loess Vineyard and Leonetti Old Block, this wine is 100% varietal. The aromas are bright and pure, with notes of raspberry, cherry, plum, anise and spice. The flavors deliver, with a sense of understated appeal."
US,92.0,50.0,Napa-Sonoma,Chandon,"Very fine, a smooth, silky wine with an elegant mousse, or quality of bubbles. It's pretty full-bodied, with subtle raspberry, peach, vanilla and brioche flavors. Easily the most complex and interesting of Chandon's lineup of sparklers."
US,93.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Stone The Crows,"Opening with a rich, luxurious nose, this wine is delightfully bright on the palate before evolving into brooding notes of black cherry and smoky oak. Hints of dark chocolate and coconut shavings round out the intrigue and complexity. The wine is ready to enjoy now, but worth cellaring through 2020."
France,86.0,16.0,Chinon,Jean-Maurice Raffault,"Bright onion skin pink wild strawberry flavored wine, with fine crisp acidity and a touch of caramel. The wine is light, fresh, fragrant, ready to drink."
Italy,89.0,10.0,Sicilia,Stemmari,"Alluring aromas of citrus, white flower and a whiff of tropical fruit come together on this. The racy palate offers lemon zest, mango, sage, saline and an almond note alongside vibrant acidity."
US,89.0,15.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"Zesty lemon peel and blossom notes are invigorating and fresh on this dry, delicately framed wine. It's concentrated with tropical mango and melon flavors, yet zippy with lime acidity. It finishes long with an elegant mineral touch."
US,87.0,10.0,California,Montevina,"Some richness and heft separate this wine from the pack, as it carries ripe white cherry and peach flavors on its soft but just-crisp-enough texture. Its medium to full body gives it a mouth-filling presence."
US,84.0,14.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"This is a lush, rich Chardonnay with especially ripe pineapple, peach and lime flavors, as well as a coating of oaky, buttered toast."
US,84.0,22.0,Willamette Valley,Kramer,"Off-dry, it's simple and clean, with not much flavor beyond basic light melon. It can best serve as a mixer for cocktails or punch."
France,90.0,20.0,JuliÃ©nas,Georges Duboeuf,"From one of the properties where Duboeuf does vinification and bottling at the estate, this is a dense and structured wine. While it does have intense, young acidity, it also offers ripe berry fruits that are bold and rich. Drink from 2016."
US,87.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Merlot (21%), Syrah (17%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and five other varieties. Aromas of blue fruit, char, plum, herb, confection and spice are followed by easy-drinking plum flavors, with a slightly clipped finish. It's a pleasant easy drinker."
France,92.0,40.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Cave de Turckheim,"Red apple and brioche aromas are tinged with lemon. The palate has the same fruit, richness and freshness, but expresses this with lightness and ease. It's a versatile sparkler, ideal for both apÃ©ritif and dinner. The finish is dry, balanced and elegant."
France,86.0,13.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Barton & Guestier,"This wine is full of red-berry flavors, fresh with acidity and a juicy texture. Lively and bright with a dancing, crisp character, it's a great apÃ©ritif-style wine."
US,90.0,27.0,Napa Valley,Titus,"Delicious and succulent, a gigantic Zinfandel. Impresses for the powerful ripeness of the blackberry, plum and cherry fruit, accented with waves of smoky wood, cocoa and Asian spices. The tannins are rich and strong. Will age for a long time, gradually losing density and becoming softer and sweeter."
US,88.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"This is a satin-smooth Merlot, nicely blended with 11% Syrah and a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon. Forward flavors, seamless, supple and flat out tasty, it weaves in threads of vanilla, cola and licorice around taut red fruits."
US,81.0,10.0,California,Esser Cellars,"Sweet and simple, with jellied blackberry and cherry flavors, harsh tannins and a sugary finish."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Amberhill,"Made from undisclosed grape varieties, this wine is simple and candied. It tastes like red cherry jam, spread on buttered white toast and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon."
France,89.0,52.0,Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´tes de Nuits,Domaine Jayer-Gilles,"An intriguingly perfumed wine that brings out highly spicy wood as well as ripe yellow fruits. This is light and ready to drink, and already enjoyable for its ripeness combined with a fresh, toasty finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Fox Run,"Savory whiffs of nut skins, earth and sweat juxtapose sweet grapefruit and peach in this slightly rustic Riesling. Delicately textured with a lacy veil of sweetness, it's balanced briskly by a core of lime acidity. The finish is long and meandering."
Argentina,89.0,22.0,Perdriel,Marchiori & Barraud,"At first the nose on this Malbec seems granulated, with individual notes of heady black fruits, oak, iron and dried blood. The palate is saturated but without much lift. Solid blackberry and chocolate flavors extend across a finish with stature."
France,83.0,15.0,Bourgogne,LupÃ©-Cholet,"Fruity, ripe and round, this is simple Chardonnay that gives pleasure from its warm texture and softness. The apple flavor leads to a gentle finish."
Italy,88.0,23.0,Curtefranca,Ricci Curbastro,"This carefully oak-aged Chardonnay opens with a bright golden color and sophisticated aromas of ripe fruit, apricot, honey, pineapple, toasted almond and vanilla. Rich creaminess drives a long finish."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Ribera del Duero,Pago del Vostal,"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine."
Australia,89.0,20.0,Coonawarra,Jim Barry,"This richly textured Coonawarra Cabernet displays typical notes of cassis, accented by ample cedar and mocha shadings. It's fairly full bodied, with a long, velvety finish; drink it over the next 4?? years."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Falanghina del Beneventano,Nativ,"An easy-drinking wine, it conveys pretty fragrances of white flowers and tropical fruit. The simple palate delivers white peach, apple and pineapple alongside fresh acidity."
US,86.0,30.0,Dundee Hills,Second Growth,"Young and forward, this pleasant wine brings black-cherry fruit front and center?a good start, but it doesn't really develop any further. It just does a quick and quiet fade out."
US,86.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Tessier Winery,"Sanguine and floral, this soft wine exudes waxy plum and cherry around a midweight core of earthiness. Shy in fruit, it finishes with a somewhat diluted character."
Spain,84.0,24.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Finca La Estacada,"This smells charred and burnt, with a leaf aroma following. It ranges from fresh to grating, with roasted tomato, plum, compost and earth flavors. Saucy and roasted on the finish, this is a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Syrah."
US,85.0,18.0,Paso Robles,The Archivist,"Plum, dill, oregano, pencil lead, tobacco and woody berry aromas show on the nose of this bottling. Light in body and flavor, the palate offers leather, tobacco, dried berry and plum-skin elements."
US,89.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foxen,"The most forward and drinkable of Foxen's many new 2011 Pinot Noirs. It's soft and juicy with raspberries and cherry flavors, plus subtleties of cola, sautÃ©ed wild mushrooms and sweet, toasty sandalwood. A pretty wine that's perfect with lamb."
US,87.0,28.0,Monticello,Trump,"A veneer of vanilla gives this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot a pastry-like scent, which coats the underlying note of wild-berry pie filling. The palate offers bright acids and firm tannins, which layer the finish."
US,85.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Vina Robles,"This is and properly dry, with smooth tannins and high acidity that lends some sting to the palate. The berry and earth flavors lack some intensity. Drink now."
US,91.0,35.0,California,Enkidu,"A dusty, sunbaked note in the aroma of this full-bodied wine meets robust and ripe fruit, wood smoke and very concentrated clove, black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors. The color is dark and deep, tannins are very firm, and the mouthfeel is somewhat astringent. This wine needs time to reach its peak, and will be best after 2022."
US,89.0,55.0,Sonoma Coast,Halleck,"Although this is from the Sonoma Coast appellation, it's high elevation, so the vineyard is often above the fog that plagues the lower Russian River Valley. As a result, the wine is quite ripe and forward in jammy raspberries, cherries, licorice and cola. New French oak adds the usual smoky, vanilla accents."
France,89.0,14.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau la Croix St-Pierre,"The seventh generation of the Carreau family has produced this rich full-bodied and structured wine. It has dense tannins as well as plenty of ripe red fruits. The structure suggests the wine will continue to age, so drink this ripe wine from 2017."
France,93.0,83.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Vray Croix de Gay,"This is a micro-sized nine-acre estate, with vines that are 50 years old. Complex and rich, it is a generous burst of ripe full Merlot that is developing well. Black fruits, spice and juicy acidity all contribute to a wine that will ready to drink from 2017."
US,90.0,25.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Amavi,"Smooth and supple, Amavi's 2005 Cabernet includes a healthy bit of Syrah, which adds details of spice and pepper to the smooth and supple cassis and black cherry fruit. Tannins are ripe and well-defined, and the wine carries subtle suggestions of olive and tea. It's focused and bright, polished and immediately delicious, though it could certainly cellar for a few years."
France,90.0,15.0,Minervois,ChÃ¢teau du Donjon,"Made from 40% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 30% Cinsault, this Minervois rosÃ© offers layered, complex scents of orange blossom, peony, ginger and red currant. Flavors of peach and taut currant unfold on the medium-weight palate, with refreshing acidity to lend lift to the mouthfeel and brighten the finish."
France,88.0,25.0,CÃ´tes de Bourg,ChÃ¢teau Guerry,"While this is a rich wine, it also has a more fruity character that brings out acidity and a streak of freshness. It's firm at the moment, reflecting a need for aging. Dense and full of berry fruits, it will be best drunk from 2017."
US,86.0,17.0,Alexander Valley,Kirkland Signature,"A little harsh in texture, but otherwise a pretty nice, dry Cabernet that should benefit from decanting. From the esteemed producer, Goldschmidt, it's filled with briary flavors of blackberries and cherries."
US,95.0,70.0,Snipes Mountain,K Vintners,"The kirsch, cranberry, dried herb, pomegranate and barrel spice aromas are laser focused, with smoked meat notes providing accents. The black fruit flavors are Ã¼ber concentrated and dense. It's wound tightly at first but when it opens up, it delivers."
US,88.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Keenan,"Keenan has a good track record with Merlot, and here's a lovely one. It's softly approachable despite firm tannins, with flavors of cherries, blackberries and cola, and an earthy note that suggests mushroom risotto."
US,93.0,45.0,Mendocino County,Sean Thackrey,"Eaglepoint Ranch has been source to powerful red wines for many years, and here's another one. It impressives for the volume of tannins and fruity ripeness. Swamps the mouth with blackberry and cherry marmalade, bacon, pepper spice and smoky oak flavors that are huge, yet balanced in tannins, oak and acidity. The alcohol is 15.2%."
Spain,84.0,52.0,Ribera del Duero,Valtravieso,"Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough. Flavors of bell pepper, pizza sauce and oregano finish without the ripeness that should be present in a high-end 2011 RDD."
US,89.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Flying Goat Cellars,"A rich Pinot that offers power and density, this is stuffed with cherry, cola and pomegranate notes. It has sizable tannins, so give it 5?? years to let them mellow."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,"Structured but elegant, it discloses delicate aromas of Spanish broom and Granny Smith apple. The savory, creamy palate delivers juicy Bartlett pear, citrus, nectarine and melon brightened by crisp acidity."
US,85.0,22.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Bray,"A Barbera offering dark plum and handfuls of meaty brawn, it has rounded tannins and plenty of intensity. Pair this with spicy sausage and risotto to help it mellow."
US,86.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Concannon,"A bit coarse in the mouth, with a sandpapery tartness through the finish. On the plus side, the wine is fully dry and well-flavored, with black cherries, currants, spicy teriyaki beef and cedar. Drink now."
US,88.0,12.0,Amador County,Sobon Estate,"Impressive for a $12 Old Vine Zin, this wine is spicy and full of pepper, much more savory than sweet with plenty of texture midpalate and decent length. Definitely full-bodied, it'll stand up to a plethora of rich foods and even age another couple of years."
Italy,95.0,74.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Conti Costanti,"Heady scents of forest floor, ripe berry, fragrant blue flower, grilled herb and a whiff of eucalyptus emerge on this superb wine. The elegantly structured palate offers juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, star anise, mint and baking spice while well-integrated tannins provide the framework. Balanced and already approachable, it also shows good mid-term aging potential. Drink through 2026."
US,94.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Force Majeure,"This is a marvelous wine, made for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone. A delectable blend of 56% MourvÃ¨dre, 38% Syrah, and 6% Grenache, it's a spice rack of aromatics, with flavors of boysenberry and raspberry over crushed rocks. Tight, tart and tangy, it has remarkable depth and density, and should age beautifully for at least a decade."
France,90.0,66.0,Champagne,Roland Champion,"Still so crisp and fruity, this is lively Champagne. It has a great tang of lemon zest and a tight texture that shows plenty of minerality. It will continue to age gracefully, allowing a more mature toasty character to come through. Drink from 2018."
Italy,88.0,42.0,Toscana,Castelli del Grevepesa,"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah offers a fragrance of black fruit and Mediterranean herbs. The palate is a bit restrained but reveals black cherry, licorice and black pepper along with notes of espresso and toasted oak."
US,91.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Spring Valley Vineyard,"This wine is 100% varietal. Pungent aromas of blue fruit, high-toned herb, pencil lead and plentiful barrel spice lead to exceptionally well-balanced polished fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support. The balance is exquisite as is the lengthy finish."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,Poliziano,"This little brother to vino Nobile embodies the essence of ripe, lip-smacking country wine. But it's no piece of candy; quite the contrary, it's full, rustic and fruit-forward. If elegance isn't the game here, then the big plum flavor and meaty, berry-loaded finish is."
US,92.0,40.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Lucienne,"Baked vanilla cake, marcona almonds and pressed guava notes make for a balanced though certainly oaken nose from the appellation's pioneering property. The flavors are round and peachy, with a nice arc of smoke and butter that lead to bitter mustard and acidic zing on the finish."
US,87.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,Fritz,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish."
Italy,89.0,19.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,CÃ  di Rajo,"Aromas of Spanish broom and peach lead the nose. The vibrant, refreshing palate offers crisp green apple, Bartlett pear and lime alongside bracing acidity tempered by small but invigorating bubbles."
US,84.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,New Departure,"Awkward, with sweet, pie-filling cherry and black raspberry flavors that have an edge of raisins, and a sharp finish. Drink now."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Terra Alta,Celler La Bollidora,"Lemony and light on the bouquet. The palate is aggressive, almondy tasting and tight, with lemony lead flavors, peach notes and a lasting but not unpleasant bitterness. Nicely balanced, with good mouthfeel. A very nice wine and a different breed within the wide world of Spanish white wines."
US,87.0,28.0,Oak Knoll District,Monticello Vineyards,"This is a strong, direct Chardonnay that offers no subtlety, but impresses for sheer power. It dazzles with tangerine, pineapple and peach flavors, with plenty of new oak. Ready now."
US,92.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"This is a mineral-driven wine from a well-farmed vineyard, drawn from specific blocks to highlight freshness and acidity. Smooth, integrated oak cradles the notes of fig and pear that veer into decadence before finding a supple balance and lengthy finish."
US,87.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Kuleto Estate,"A Zinfandel-based blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, this wine is hearty, thick and dense. It traffics in smoky char, leathery tannins and a strong taste of tobacco, finishing with a flash of red plum."
US,90.0,20.0,Mendocino County,Monte Volpe,"A deep amber color and a rich, almost thick mouthfeel support tempting aromas and flavors like honey, orange marmalade and toasted almonds. Complex and interesting, it's super sweet and syrupy, but still stays light in weight."
US,87.0,64.0,Russian River Valley,Gracianna,"A rustic nose gives way to a touch of clove and Asian spice, as full-bodied, robustly ripe baked plum and cherry generously provide flavor and power on the palate. The spiciness lingers on the finish."
US,92.0,35.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Comartin,"Jet-black aromatics of creosote, charred meats, pepper and plum-blackberry jam make an excellent entry point for this wine from a vineyard in the new Ballard Canyon appellation. Blackberry sauce leads the palate, with espresso bitterness and strong acidity throughout. A powerful but beautiful Syrah."
US,92.0,40.0,Anderson Valley,Phillips Hill,"This is a great example of how Pinot Noir doesn't need deep color and overripe flavors to be fascinating and delicious. Light in appearance and tawny rather than bright red at the rim, it exudes nutmeg, cherry and pomegranate aromas. The flavors are fruity and nervy, all tart cherry, and raspberry with black tea accents, excellent acidity and firm, light tannins."
US,93.0,36.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Melville,"Tasted blind alongside the 2005 and 2010 vintages, this bottling, which is Chad Melville's first for his family winery after years focused on the vineyard, carries the same persistent sizzle of acidity on the front of the sip. But it's fresher on the nose, with pear juice, lychee and vanilla dust, and more approachable on the tropical palate, where jasmine, exotic banana, papaya, plumeria and a touch of guava shine."
Italy,91.0,28.0,Montecucco,Collemassari,"Some lovely red wines are coming from the Montecucco wine region (located in coastal Tuscany) and Collemassari leads the pack of this new and exciting group of vintners. Soft cherry, leather, spice, and earthy mineral tones create harmony and momentum."
US,90.0,20.0,Long Island,Channing Daughters,"This dry Merlot rosÃ© is the benchmark from which to compare each of Channing Daughter's seven rosato wines this vintage. It's elegantly framed, perfumed with waxy-white florals and crisp strawberry and cherry notes. Dry and crisp, yet luscious in body with a lingering touch of bramble on the finish."
US,86.0,20.0,Temecula Valley,South Coast,"Round peach, ripe nectarine, melon and Anjou pear aromas shows on the nose of this bottling, tempered by a grassy and wet steel character. The palate shows poached apple and pear flavors, accented with lime."
France,86.0,25.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Venus,"A romantic name for an easy fruity wine. Spice from wood gives the black-currant fruit richness and some complexity. With its acidity and dry core, this is a wine to keep for another year. Drink from 2018."
US,93.0,35.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Syncline,"This 100% varietal wine delivers mineral, citrus twist, raw meat, raspberry and black pepper notes. The palate is full bodied and packed to the brim with fruit and savory flavors. It brings a seamlessness and length that are absolutely dazzling."
US,86.0,15.0,Central Coast,Ryzin,"Rich red cherry, anise and a bit of smoke show on the nose of this affordably priced bottling from Kevin Riley. The palate is quite grippy, with flavors of dried blueberry, dark chocolate and black coffee."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Chianti,Cecchi,"Aromas of underbrush, leather and blue flower lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Colorino and Canaiolo. The fresh, easy-drinking palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry and a hint of licorice alongside supple tannins."
Italy,92.0,18.0,Lugana,Tenuta Roveglia,"Enticing scents of fragrant white flower, stone fruit and crushed herb lead the way while the creamy, savory palate doles out white peach, mature yellow apple and tangerine zest. A blast of mineral energy lifts the lingering finish."
US,87.0,21.0,North Fork of Long Island,Clovis Point,"Plump and voluminous on the palate, this full-bodied wine is marked by swirls of caramel, orange and peach flavors. It's a bit plush in feel but accents of spice and smoked lend nuance."
US,88.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Sheldrake Point,"One of the few Finger Lakes' GewÃ¼rztraminers to exhibit such spot-on varietal typicity, this is gorgeously aromatic with loads of honeysuckle, lychee, stone fruit and exotic spice notes. Off-dry, concentrated and bold on the palate, it's balanced with just a touch of phenolic bitterness."
US,91.0,20.0,El Dorado,Perry Creek,"A creamy texture and apple pie flavors make this so rich it's almost a dessert. It is not actually sweet but has a full body and lush viscosity, presumably from barrel fermentation. It shows the shaping influence that barrels can have on heft and mouthfeel without adding heavy oak flavors per se. Delicious!"
France,91.0,57.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"A crisp, finely balanced wine, this is packed with fresh citrus, peach-skin and green-apple flavors. It's a textured wine with layers of minerality on the palate. The acidity is just right?a fine streak that cuts through the fruitiness and gives a tight, taut finish."
Italy,93.0,250.0,Chianti Classico,Isole e Olena,"Underbrush, French oak, Mediterranean herb, menthol and blackberry aromas unfold on this elegantly structured red. The full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, cinnamon, star anise and chopped mint alongside fine-grained tannins. This is still young and needs to develop to its full potential. Drink 2018??028."
France,86.0,10.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine Haut Marin,"With a touch of honey and ripe white-peach flavors, this crisp wine has a warm side. It is also certainly fruity, lively with acidity and citrus. This is an easy wine, refreshing for the summer, ready to drink now."
US,92.0,110.0,Napa Valley,Hestan,"Big, rich and complex, this is a Cabernet you want to lay down. Tasted in the late Fall of 2013, it's tannic, oaky and dry, brimming with spectacularly ripe blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. The alcohol is a bit high, giving the wine some heat, and yet the balance is so good that the wine should easily develop over the next eight years."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Terlano,"Located in the cool, mountainous region of Alto Adige in the far north of Italy, Cantina Terlano boasts one of Italy's finest lines of crisp white wines. Albeit more informal, this luminous and fresh Pinot Grigio offers pristine aromas of stone fruit and citrus."
US,91.0,49.0,Paso Robles,Culton,"Reserved on the nose at first, this wine eventually releases pressed black raspberry and elderberry fruit as well as a peppery teriyaki element. Similar fresh fruit shows on the palate, enhanced by anise, dried sage and other aromatic herbs."
US,94.0,70.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"A big, hard, dry Cabernet whose mountain tannins need quite some time to resolve. Right now they're tough as nails, although the blackberry fruit is so brilliant and intense, it punches right through. Give this dramatic wine at least six years, and it could well develop beyond the next decade."
France,92.0,99.0,Saint-Mont,Producteurs Plaimont,"From a small parcel of 19th-century vines planted on the hill of Saint-Mont, this is a finely structured rich wine. It has dark tannins and dense black fruits that are balanced by acidity. Rich, spicy and full, it still has tannins that will begin to soften shortly. Drink from 2018 until 2024."
US,88.0,30.0,Central Coast,Clos LaChance,"Slightly funky aromas of dried, composting red and purple roses meet with crushed mint, vanilla and red berries on the nose of this complex bottling. Pomegranate, red plum and strawberry fruit show on the palate, bolstered by wet gravel, thyme and black-pepper spice."
Italy,86.0,18.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Poderi Colla,"Muscular tannins nearly mask raspberry and cherry notes in this structured red. The juicy palate leads to a fairly long, earthy finish. Drink with pepperoni and sausage pizza."
Spain,88.0,25.0,Priorat,Vall Llach,"Vall Llach is known for making ripe-styled wines, and this fits the bill. Embruix is ripe and raisiny on the nose, with black currant and prune-like aromas. A thick, jammy, stewy palate holds flavors of prune, blackberry and bitter chocolate, while the finish is hot and sticky, with molasses and chocolate flavors."
Italy,94.0,40.0,Chianti Classico,Lamole di Lamole,"Crushed black cherry, leather, tobacco, anise, underbrush and grilled herb are just some of the aromas and flavors offered by this concentrated, vibrant wine. Firm acidity and chewy tannins provide the structure, while a licorice note marks the lingering finish."
France,87.0,24.0,MÃ¢con-AzÃ©,Domaine de la Garenne,"While ripe, this also has a firm structure, with a mix of rich yellow-fruit flavors and austere minerality. With the acidity just beginning to soften, it will turn into a full and more rounded wine."
US,87.0,54.0,Napa Valley,Pine Ridge,"There's a lightness to this 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot that surprises, making for a friendly, approachable entry. Cassis, raspberry and cedar mix around rounded tannins and a medium-length finish."
Spain,85.0,7.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Round and even, this dry white from the well-known Rioja producer offers sweet hay, apple and vanilla aromas and flavors. Nicely composed, this has decent balance and a smooth, if modest finish. Best to drink now, and a good bar or party pour. Best Buy. ?M.M."
US,89.0,36.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Stottle,"This blend of 37% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 26% MourvÃ¨dre is brooding, with its char, smoke, cranberry, dark plum and woodspice aromas. On the palate, silky black cherry flavors are accented with barrel-derived notes, striking a lovely balance."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Sainte Barbe,Both tannins and ripe berry fruits are in juicy balance in this wine. It gives it density as well as a crisp character that is enhanced by the smoky flavor that comes through. Drink this wine from 2018.
US,87.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Cambridge,"This combines all five red Bordeaux varieties, with half of the wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. Juicy black cherry, cedar and integrated oak make for a straightforward, light-bodied and high-toned experience in the glass."
US,90.0,42.0,Sonoma County,Judge Palmer,"Subdued on the nose, this is a thick, juicy red made in small amounts that offers affordability within its bright streak of cassis and currant. A backbone of tannin provides strength and concentrated power."
US,90.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,Bright mango and pineapple tones are cut by laser-sharp edges of lime in this delicately structured dry Riesling. Invigorating white grapefruit and a steely sensation gild a lingering finish.
US,90.0,16.0,Snipes Mountain,Smasne Cellars,"Sweetly floral, this concentrated and penetrating wine, from some special old-vine plantings on Snipes Mountain, smells and tastes like fancy perfume in a wine bottle. Though not sweet, it could certainly be served as a dessert wine, given its exotic character."
France,93.0,31.0,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,"This is a remarkably spicy wine that is also finely balanced. It's sophisticated as well as rich, with spice and lychee flavors lifted by a crisp edge of acidity. It's complex in texture and should age well. Drink from 2015."
US,92.0,45.0,Ribbon Ridge,Styring,"Styring releases their wines with plenty of bottle age and doesn't shy from high alcohol. The level of ripeness in this bottling is not for everyone, veering more toward Zin-like power than Pinot Noir elegance. It's lushly aromatic, with dominant pine needle and raspberry extract flavors. A dense, concentrated and pungent wine with a spicy top note."
US,90.0,42.0,Sonoma Mountain,WillowBrook Cellars,"Rhubarb, cranberry and strawberry mix on the nose in this richly inviting wine that is textured and not overwhelming in weight. Featuring electric acidity, the wine finishes boldly in blackberry and licorice."
Italy,94.0,45.0,Gattinara,Travaglini,"Earthy fragrances of violet, tilled soil, leather, menthol and spicy plum jump out of the glass. The delicious palate boasts structure and finesse, seamlessly weaving together ripe wild cherry, crushed blackberry, juicy plum and baking spice alongside tightly knit but polished tannins. Drink 2016??023."
US,86.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,Chandler Reach,"This blend of 70% Syrah, 10% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese delivers vanilla, shaved coconut and dark fruit aromas. It's full bodied, with fruit and barrel-derived flavors that linger on the finish. The oak influence is cumbersome."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Roero,MalvirÃ ,"Lime blossom, bread crust and a whiff of toast lead the nose. Slightly fizzy when first poured, the lively palate offers citrus, green Anjou pear and bitter nut while a hint of flinty mineral closes the finish."
Spain,85.0,18.0,Cava,Damia,"A funk city nose is far from fresh and familiar?look for aromas of vitamins, pickled cabbage and warm, dusty radiator. A slightly rough full-sized palate tastes briny and funky, with little fruit. This is chunky, briny tasting and salty on the finish."
Italy,86.0,21.0,Lugana,Perla del Garda,"Made from the Turbiana grape, this easy-drinking wine opens with aromas of peach and pineapple. The lively palate offers tart green apple and citrus alongside bright acidity. Sip as an apÃ©ritif or pair with vegetable quiche."
US,85.0,18.0,Napa Valley,Luna,"Soft, dry and simple, with modest peach, pineapple, lemon and vanilla flavors. Drink now."
US,93.0,72.0,Willamette Valley,LennÃ© Estate,"The name means ?five chosen??and references the barrels selected for this reserve-level wine. Dense, complex and refined, it remains quite compact with nicely layered ripe berry fruit. The tannins carry a suggestion of orange pekoe tea, and the length is impressive. Drink 2020 through 2028."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Donatella Cinelli Colombini,"Here's a modern, plush and extracted wine that delivers bold spice, leather, bitter chocolate, cola and cassis. There's a nervous acidic vein throughout the wine and the tannins are still young and need time to age. Give this Brunello a few more years in the cellar."
France,87.0,25.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Domaine Pierre Usseglio et Fils,"Plummy and savory, this plump, supple-textured wine is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% MourvÃ¨dre. It offers an easygoing mouthful of fruit in an early-drinking style."
France,84.0,20.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,ChÃ¢teau PÃ©gau,"I continue to be perplexed by the Pagan white CuvÃ©e LÃ´ne. Like previous vintages, the 2016 is tight and lean, marked by underripe melon and citrus notes. The blend is 40% Clairette, 30% Bourboulenc, 20% Grenache Blanc and 10% Ugni Blanc."
US,87.0,18.0,North Fork of Long Island,McCall,"Ripe yellow peach and sunny citrus flavors are forward and fresh in this plush unoaked Chardonnay. While dry and medium bodied in style, it's soft and round in texture. Easy yielding acidity highlights a succulent tangerine finish."
Spain,85.0,12.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Rectoral do Umia,"Peach, melon and vanilla cookie aromas are mild, simple and a touch mealy. The mouthfeel on this basic AlbariÃ±o is fleshy and plump, with adequate acidity. Sweet apple and tropical fruit flavors are lasting and stay the course."
France,92.0,60.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Brown,"ChÃ¢teau Brown continues its impressive push to quality with this fine 2010. It brings demonstrates the structure of the year with its firm, youthful tannins. But it also shows plentiful black-currant flavor, layered with acidity. Classic and serious, this is a wine for aging."
US,86.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"Aromatic for the variety, this wine shows notes of apple and pear. It's lightly spritzy with an almost unctuous feel."
US,90.0,50.0,Long Island,The Grapes of Roth,"Big and brooding with richly concentrated black plums and velvety, mouthfilling tannins, Roman Roth's namesake Merlot is boldly structured, but beautifully nuanced as well, with sprays of violet perfume and just a whiff of wet, earthy forest and dried herb notes. Drink now with a good decant, or hold for another 2?? years."
US,85.0,23.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"While the aroma is a touch earthy, the flavors in this full-bodied and plush-textured wine resemble honey, peach and almond. With a hint of sweetness to round out the mouthfeel, this could be a good match for a wide variety of cheeses."
US,87.0,28.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"This is a bit fat and forward, with flavors of tropical fruit and banana, and a light dusting of cocoa, cinnamon and butterscotch. It's a tasty wine to drink up as soon as possible."
Spain,89.0,25.0,Rioja,Castillo Clavijo,"This is a riper-style gran reserva with baked, slightly mulchy aromas of berry fruits that turn more exotic and spicy as they open. Leafy flavors of spice and earth come with caramel richness, while rooty spice and dry tannins control the finish."
US,90.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,J. Christopher,"Fragrant and generously fruity, this is a bowl of raspberries and cherries, with just the right acidity to keep it lively and fresh. Light suggestions of cola and nutmeg add further interest."
US,90.0,14.0,Rogue Valley,Foris,"A directly appealing wine with notes of apple, toast and melon. It's fresh in feel, medium bodied with a good sense of balance throughout and a lingering finish."
Italy,91.0,38.0,Alto Adige Terlano,Manincor,"A structured but polished Sauvignon made from organically farmed grapes. The delicious palate delivers white peach, grapefruit and honeydew melon accented with mineral and a ginger note. Fermentation in large casks gives complexity."
US,86.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"Sharp, pungent grass scents and a bit of rough citrus form the nose. Once sipped, thin and brisk apple cider flavors get help from slight kiwi and fresh acidity. Serve with bay scallop salad."
France,86.0,24.0,Bourgogne,Domaine Faiveley,"Attractive red fruits dominate this light and fruity wine. Good acidity and bright flavors are smoothed by wood, while the aftertaste brings back the fruit. Drink now."
France,93.0,55.0,Champagne,Charles Ellner,"As its name indicates, this is a blend of premier cru wines. Holding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it is ripe with yellow fruit and apple flavors tinged attractively with touches of toastiness. This rich Champagne is ready to drink."
France,90.0,20.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Vignerons des Terres SecrÃ¨tes,"Produced from old, low-yielding vines, this delicious wine balances crisp acidity with intense white fruit. It's poised and stylish, with a cool character expressed in its acidity and lemon zest-like aftertaste. Drink now."
US,87.0,25.0,Wahluke Slope,Almquist,"Lightly volatile aromas are followed by cranberry, cherry and herb flavors that show intensity and freshness."
France,85.0,18.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Les MaÃ®tres Vignerons de la Presqu'Ã®le de Saint-Tropez,Intense acidity combines with spice and just the right amount of fresh fruitiness to give this lively wine that's full in the mouth. It's ripe and ready to drink.
Argentina,85.0,11.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Waxy, floral white-fruit aromas are tropical in style. This feels citrusy, with some pulpiness to the texture. Tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors finish tangy and citric, with one-dimensional juiciness."
US,85.0,18.0,Virginia,The Williamsburg Winery,"A Chardonnay with an easygoing disposition, this has a broad, waxy aroma of white orchard fruit. The melon-flavored palate bears a slight oiliness. Pair it with grilled swordfish steaks."
US,90.0,24.0,North Fork of Long Island,WÃ¶lffer,"Fresh green herbs on the nose accumulate fruit and floral notes on the palate of this pretty but robust rosÃ©. A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay and GewÃ¼rztraminer, it offers intense red berry and watermelon fruitiness along with a pleasantly clingy, silken mouthfeel."
US,88.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Robert Hall,"Roasted meat, charcoal, elderberry, asphalt and smoke show on the nose of this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot and 12% Malbec. The smoke extends into the palate, where tangy plum and berry flavors mix with dark chocolate notes, soft texture and a lingering acidity."
US,90.0,35.0,Paso Robles,Falcone,"This delicious wine shows Paso ripeness in the form of blackberry, cherry, anise and chocolate, with soft tannins and just enough acidity to balance the richness. The cool vintage played a part here, giving the wine long hangtime flavors while keeping the alcohol level low."
France,86.0,16.0,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,"This is typical Pinot Blanc?its warm, fruity and soft with just a touch of spice. The wine has an attractive line of acidity from its pear flavors, making it balanced and ready to drink."
Argentina,86.0,12.0,Mendoza,Ruca Malen,"Standard plum and berry aromas form a harmonious opening. The palate on this Cab is a bit acidic, with a clipped overall mouthfeel and lightly baked, earthy flavors of generic black fruits. The finish is leathery tasting and chewy."
France,85.0,25.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Tour Saint-Joseph,"On the austere side, the tannins dry and firm. The fruit flavors echo the severe character, with red currant flavors and a slight vegetal edge."
Spain,87.0,16.0,Terra Alta,Celler BÃ rbara ForÃ©s,"Prickly citrus aromas are jumpy and a touch sulfuric. This feels leesy, creamy and fat in the mouth, with creamy, tropical flavors of melon and papaya. Bitter flavors of almond and citrus pith vie with lees-based vanilla notes on a round, plump finish."
France,92.0,30.0,Sauternes,ChÃ¢teau Suduiraut,"The lighter of the two second wines of classed-growth Suduiraut, this is a more accessible reflection of the richness of the grand vin. At four years old, it's still young, its acidity and crisp lemon flavors contrasting its core of botrytis and delicious fruit. Drink this balanced wine from 2020."
France,88.0,20.0,Collines RhÃ´daniennes,Domaine Jean-Michel Gerin,"This is almost as impressive as Gerin's La Champine Syrah, which is a tremendous achievement as Viognier seems much harder to do well. Hints of crushed stone and struck flint add nuance to the ripe apricot aromas, while the exotic, tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are reined in by a touch of citrus-pith bitterness. Drink now??018."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Chapelle d'AliÃ©nor,"In 2001, AliÃ©nor and Alexandre de Malet Roquefort bought this property which is 15 minutes southeast of their ChÃ¢teau La GaffeliÃ¨re. From 8.5 acres of Sauvignon Blanc, SÃ©millon and Muscadelle, this is a rounded, soft wine that promises well. It is going towards the tropical fruit area with its apricot and pineapple flavors. Behind, the acidity is tangy and crisp with a tight, nervy aftertaste."
Italy,87.0,14.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato,"A playful touch of sweetness appears in the mouth, giving this an added sense of softness and dimension. Its momentum is carried forth thanks to soft tones of peach, honey and jasmine."
France,89.0,41.0,Champagne,MoÃ«t & Chandon,"Unchallenged as the world's best-selling Champagne, this bottling is impressive. It has become slightly drier over the years, currently emphasizing the fruit quality with apple and lime flavors. The acidity and crisp texture make it immediately attractive. Light and fruity at the end, it is a good apÃ©ritif wine."
US,81.0,11.0,New York,Brotherhood,"Creamy on the nose with a scent of musk and flowers, this wine from Brotherhood is too angular to fully enjoy. The acidity is good but the overall flavors are lean."
US,87.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Newton,"A soft, fleshy wine to drink now. It has a fancy mouthfeel, with a firm hit of tannins and acidity, and lush flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and spices."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Langhe,Anna Maria Abbona,"Here's an informal expression of Nebbiolo from young vines with tight aromas of pressed blue flowers, licorice, dried currants and cherry cola. The wine shows both a healthy acidic and tannic component and could pair with braised pork or lamb."
Spain,83.0,22.0,Getariako Txakolina,TxomÃ­n EtxanÃ­z,"This low-alcohol Basque rosÃ© starts off funky. Pickled, peppery, herbaceous aromas lead to a tart, acidic palate that's not unusual for this style of wine. Sour, herbal, peppery flavors repeat in lighter form on the finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Hawkins Cellars,"Clean and firm, with strawberry fruit and an earthy base. Hints of compost and tobacco came through in both the scents and flavors, while tannins were moderately coarse. Drink soon."
US,86.0,25.0,Guenoc Valley,Langtry,"This wine is firmly in the herbal-vegetal camp. It smells like yellow tomatoes and tastes like tarragon and parsley, with a full body and soft acidity. It finishes slightly sweet."
Italy,90.0,160.0,Barolo,Elio Grasso,"Aromas of mature berry, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied red. The palate shows dried black cherry, coconut, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside fine-grained tannins. This isn't a classic Nebbiolo but it's polished, balanced and will appeal to those who enjoy oak-driven sensations."
Italy,89.0,23.0,Rosso di Montalcino,La Mannella,"Here is a beautiful and charming Rosso di Montalcino (the wine sometimes referred to as a ?Baby Brunello?? with spice notes, toast and black mineral wrapped carefully around a core of cherry fruit. The wine shows good crispness, polished tannins and would pair with pasta and meat sauce."
France,94.0,42.0,Chablis,Domaine Pinson,"Structured and with a strongly crisp and textured character, this wine also has a touch of toast from wood aging. Ripe green and yellow fruits are part of the concentration and dense flavors. It is still young, so wait until 2018."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Trentino,Mezzacorona,"This opens with delicate aromas of white peach, vanilla and toasted oak that carry over to the palate along with candied lemon drop and apple. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish."
US,89.0,25.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Zaca Mesa,"A very rich, opulent white wine, made from 100% of this rare RhÃ´ne variety. Brims with spicy tangerine marmalade flavors, with the vanilla and smoky caramel from ten months in French oak. A brisk spine of acidity provides clean balance to the richness."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Barbera d'Asti,Coppo,"Aromas of underbrush, baked earth, oak, coffee, mature dark-skinned berry and a whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firm, straightforward palate offers tart cherry, espresso, toast and menthol alongside fine-grained tannins."
US,87.0,45.0,Paso Robles,Venteux,"Here's a lush young Petite Sirah brimming with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur, dark chocolate and licorice flavors that taste a little sweet. It's tannic and immature now, but should age well for up to a decade."
US,91.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"This wine is 100% Cabernet, coming from Seven Hills, Loess, Summit View, Yellow Jacket, Stone Valley, Ferguson and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Locked-up aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb, vanilla and dark fruit give way to rich but well balanced black-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins offer sufficient support."
US,84.0,40.0,Grand Valley,Creekside Cellars,"Dark and jammy on the nose, the palate brings bouncy blackberry and blueberry-sauce flavors. Textured black pepper notes lead to the finish on this medium-bodied, medium-tannin wine."
US,84.0,18.0,California,Row Eleven,Strong aromas and flavors like smoke and bacon seem heavy in this medium-bodied but tannic wine. A dish with bacon might bring it around.
US,91.0,60.0,Carneros,Blue Farm,"From a larger portion of viticulturist Anne Moller-Racke's home vineyard, this wine needs time to unravel itself out of a compact and concentrated funk of cedar and mint. The tannin weight is present and powerful. Roses and wild raspberries form a pact of flavor and beguiling aromatic invitation."
US,88.0,13.0,Finger Lakes,Fulkerson,"Zesty aromas of fresh lemon and tangerine peel add vibrancy to this brisk, dry Riesling. It's elegant and fruity, and it offers loads of crisp green-apple and pear flavors that are accented by dusty minerality. A hint of lime-skin astringency surfaces on the finish."
Australia,89.0,19.0,Rutherglen,Campbells,"For a fortified wine with a light amber hue, this is wonderfully fresh and citrusy, with aromas and flavors of marmalade and bergamot. Honeyed, toffee-like notes add depth, with the richness of the wine brought home by the slightly viscous finish."
US,88.0,55.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Bernardus,"Faint cranberry and incense aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more flavors, including coffee, black tar, pomegranate and peppercorns."
US,91.0,48.0,Ribbon Ridge,Domaine Divio,"The lightly fruity flavors conjure cranberry and raspberry, with moderate acidity. This young wine should improve with further bottle age. Best to tuck it away for another three or four years."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Chianti Classico,Castellare di Castellina,"There's an interesting note of honey or maple syrup that gives this Riserva a uniquely smooth and supple style. Fruit aromas recall dried prunes, fig and currants. The wine offers elegant, fine texture in the mouth."
Spain,87.0,40.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Concentrated and sweet, with aromas of raisin and cassis that lead onto an intense, syrupy palate, with salty berry, brown sugar and fudge flavors. This is deep as a country well, with a ton of flavor. But truth be told, it's tannic as can be, with a crushing mouthfeel that makes food mandatory."
US,90.0,20.0,Rutherford,Long Meadow Ranch,"Clean, vibrant in acidity and ripe in fruit, with lemon and lime flavors accented with a hit of green gooseberries. The finish is totally dry and stimulating. The cool 2012 vintage has given this wine elegance, making it a another value after the 2010 and 2011."
US,92.0,95.0,Temecula Valley,Leoness,"Ripe and thick kirsch aromas meet with a minty chocolate lift on the nose of this bottling from one of the most important producers in Temecula, where the winery's influence is unparalleled. The warmer climate influence is dialed back expertly on the palate, allowing herb-laced black-plum and berry fruit to shine, decorated with lavender and bay leaf."
Italy,82.0,20.0,Delle Venezie,Cara Mia,"Light and watery, this boxed Sauvignon Blanc offers simple fruit with some mineral and citrus at the back. There's not much here, but the freshness is nice."
France,91.0,19.0,Fitou,GÃ©rard Bertrand,"Muddled blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry are the initial aromas on the nose of this wine, with supporting notes of sweet spice, toasted oak, crushed lavender and bay leaf. The palate is plush and juicy, with ripe fruit flavors that are framed by accents of licorice, toasted peppercorn and mocha. Drink now??018."
US,90.0,25.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Joyce,"Hot, salty popcorn, pan-fried apples and melting butter show the oak but in a judicious manner. Flavors of lemon are layered over poached apples, all presented with a mouth-enlivening acidity, and culminating with a touch of vanilla bean on the finish."
France,92.0,128.0,Gevrey-Chambertin,Domaine Jacques Prieur,"From young vines in Chambertin, this is big and generous, showing the richness of the year as well as its depth of fruit. Firm tannins help to give the wine shape."
US,89.0,32.0,Monticello,Stinson,"This wine is teeming with black fruit, cassis and sage. The palate is a complex and evolving accomplishment?bright black cherry and sage meld with earthy notes of cedar and tobacco, all framed by structured tannins. The finish is long and woody."
France,85.0,20.0,Irancy,Simonnet-Febvre,"Irancy produces lightweight Pinot Noir, emphasizing the freshest raspberry flavors, allied to soft, dry tannins. There is a smoky element here that is attractive. The finish, with its acidity, shows the crispness of this northern production area."
France,91.0,36.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Coutet,"Produced from organically grown grapes, the wine is rich and structured. It comes from an estate that has never seen pesticides or artificial fertilizers (the previous owner was 104 years old when she died and never used them). It is a full of blackberry fruits, rich with tannins and firm with a dark core of dryness. Drink this wine from 2020."
US,91.0,75.0,Willamette Valley,Domaine Serene,"This opens with a very pretty nose?scents of clay, mineral, blueberry, cassis and a whiff of rather high-toned volatility. In the mouth the barrel flavors bring dusty cocoa and chocolate. A full-bodied wine, still young, sharp and edgy. Best to give it a few more years in the cellar, to smooth out some of the rawness."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Sicilia,Cusumano,"This pretty Chardonnay from Sicily (that sees six months in oak) delivers notes of apricot, banana, peach and a touch of playful exotic spice in the background. The wine is well-made and approachable and would pair beautifully with roasted eggplant and basil or fragrant Asian foods."
Italy,84.0,15.0,Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,Ciavolich Giuseppe,"There's an overripe, saturated element to this Trebbiano that is reflected in its deep golden color and its aromas of melon, apricot and honey. The mouthfeel is soft and sticky."
US,84.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Standing Sun,"Made from Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre, this is a simple, soft wine. It shows California-sweet raspberry and cherry flavors. You can even chill it a little bit."
US,88.0,36.0,Carneros,Domaine Carneros,"A vibrant, useful rosÃ© sparkling wine, full-bodied and rich. Crisp acidity brightens flamboyant flavors of raspberries, cherries, yeast and vanilla. Drink this dry bubbly now."
France,86.0,14.0,Pays d'Oc,M. Chapoutier,"This is a pretty and floral rosÃ©, with attractive notes of strawberry, red cherry, sweet pea and white clover. The light-weight palate offers vibrant notes of red currant and lime peel that carry through to the bright and refreshing finish. Drink now."
US,88.0,36.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"With 10% Malbec, this estate red is lightly spiced with clove and cinnamon notes, while fresh cherry and blackberry flavors develop on the palate. Moderate in tannin and oak, it reveals its balance as it opens."
Argentina,89.0,17.0,Mendoza,Argie,"A full wine with smoked meat, licorice and black-fruit jam aromas. The palate is healthy, snappy and tannic, with earthy, full-blast berry flavors that veer toward sweet raisin and syrup but then pull back before falling off the cliff. Saturated, dense and raisiny, but still very rich, real and rewarding."
US,87.0,35.0,Anderson Valley,Baxter,"There's lots of forward raspberry, cherry and pomegranate fruit in this soft, lush wine. Oak brings an additional layer of richness. It's delicious?like toast spread with butter and jam?but a little one-dimensional. However, it's a wonderful dimension to explore now."
US,92.0,170.0,Napa Valley,Jarvis,"This estate wine made of 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Cabernet Franc, 27% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot spent nearly two years in all-new French oak. Time has elevated its sanguine, herbaceous characteristics, melding them within a context of graceful softness dotted in black pepper, black olive and meat."
France,94.0,50.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"One of the top wines from Henri Bourgeois, this is rich and ageworthy. Its green and white fruits push through a concentrated structure to give a dense wine with ripeness and great elegance."
US,89.0,38.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"This blend of 79% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah is a powerhouse, showing hot asphalt, blueberry pie, mocha and teriyaki-pepper pork on the nose. The palate is quite dense with elderberries and roasted beef elements, with sour and bitter accents pulling the flavors in interesting directions."
Australia,84.0,48.0,Mornington Peninsula,Yabby Lake Vineyard,"A good wine...but disappointing given the high quality of the winery's Chardonnay. This is a plump, medium-bodied Pinot with a somewhat coarse texture and rather simple sour-cherry flavors."
France,85.0,24.0,MÃ¢con La Roche Vineuse,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"This wine offers fresh lemon and a lightly creamy fruitiness. It is floral in character with attractive acidity. Fruity, with a crisp citrus tang at the end, it is ready to drink."
US,90.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gamache,"Woodspice, herb and coffee aromas vie for attention on this blend of Champoux (60%) and Ciel du Cheval vineyard fruit. The black-fruit flavors show a good sense of balance that lingers through the long, mesquite-accented finish."
US,85.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Napa Wine Co.,"A solid if standard Cabernet, this show typical varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants and anise, with the requisite jacket of toasty oak. Dry and full bodied, there's some bitterness on the finish that suggests its limited ageability. Drink now."
US,88.0,16.0,Central Coast,Silver Spoon,"On the paler side of the the Chardonnay scale, the nose is subtle, with light touches of cream, butterscotch and smoke. There is a decent tension between ripe, lemongrass-like fruit and a bitter, grapefruit rind acidity in this wine from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton."
US,84.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Midnight,"With high alcohol, this blend of Zinfandel and Syrah has a hot, peppery mouthfeel. The flavors are of slightly burnt, pie-filling blackberries and cherries."
Italy,91.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,Tenuta di Nozzole,"This is a ripe and chewy wine with syrupy aromas of mature cherry, blackberry, cured meat and pipe tobacco (there's a 10% component of Cabernet Sauvignon that adds density and thickness to the Sangiovese). The wine is smooth and velvety with a very vibrant and bright feel on the close."
Spain,90.0,33.0,Vino de la Tierra de CÃ¡diz,Huerta de AlbalÃ¡,"This blend from CÃ¡diz features Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's big, ripe and minty on the nose, with hints of animal fur and leather. A blocky, full palate weighs in at 15.5%, while flavors of oak and vanilla blend well with spiced berry fruit. A drying finish tastes mostly of oak. Drink through 2025."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Collio,Mario Schiopetto,This vibrant Pinot Grigio opens with aromas of white flowers and white tree fruit. The round palate offers mature pear and green apple alongside bright acidity but the structure doesn't fully support the evident alcohol.
Italy,90.0,30.0,Sicilia,COS,"Intense aromas of wild cherry, baking spice, tilled soil and savory herb lead the nose on this soulful, silky red. The round, smooth palate doles out juicy red cherry, strawberry jelly, mineral, white pepper and an intriguing note of zabaglione alongside soft, supple tannins and bright acidity.."
US,94.0,95.0,Rutherford,Round Pond,"Extraordinarily ripe and sweet in blackberries, cassis and figs, with a lovely perfume of violets and cedar, this soft, lush Cabernet, which was blended with some Petit Verdot, is so decadent now, you can hardly resist it. But it's pretty tannic, with good acidity, and has the structure to ride out the next eight years."
US,88.0,35.0,Red Mountain,Januik,"From one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this shows prominent toast, vanilla, coffee and marionberry aromas. The palate is considerably more restrained, bringing a sense of lightness. Alone, each delivers, but the two seem out of sync."
Spain,93.0,162.0,Ribera del Duero,GarcÃ­a Figuero,"This inky, concentrated bruiser opens with lemony oak, graphite, earth tones and deep black-fruit aromas. Like the nose, the palate is intense and ripe as Tinto Fino gets, with smooth, manageable tannins. Flavors of blackberry, prune, cassis, lemon rind and tobacco end with power, class and depth; drink from 2017??027."
US,90.0,15.0,California,Harken,"A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Castellani Michele & Figli,This offers much of the intensity of Amarone with some of the easy-drinking appeal of Valpolicella. Twists of ripe cherry and dried ginger lend it extra personality.
France,83.0,17.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Damase,"The fruit is extremely extracted, making for a wine that is tough, very firm and hard without the juicy character needed to see it through."
France,90.0,25.0,Fronton,ChÃ¢teau Coutinel,"While NÃ©grette dominates this blend, the addition of Cabernet and Syrah gives an extra ripe complexity, while adding sinews to the structure. Red berry fruits and a fresh layer of acidity are added to the oak from the barrique aging. Drink from 2016."
US,89.0,22.0,Ribbon Ridge,Adelsheim,"Outside of a couple of Michigan wineries, Adelsheim may be the only domestic producer of this obscure white grape, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc. This aromatic, European-styled wine carries scents of pear and citrus, with crisp fruit flavors buoyed by a bracing minerality."
France,90.0,40.0,Chinon,Pascal & Alain Lorieux,"The great 2009 vintage in the Loire has produced a rich wine, the wood flavors balancing with the full black plum fruit. There is a toasty character that acts as a counterpoint. Along with the acidity, the flavors suggest a wine for aging over 2?? years."
Spain,88.0,11.0,Cava,Mas de Monistrol,"Pretty pear, apple and other dusty white-fruit aromas start this cleansing cava on its way to pure citrus, Granny Smith apple and lime flavors. It has a mildly linear, angular feel but it doesn't come across sheer or sour; to the contrary, it's balanced and generous with its fruit."
US,93.0,45.0,Monterey County,Moxy,"Hearty aromas of blueberry, leather, uncrushed peppercorns, fresh violets and a touch of oak smoke greet the nose on this rich and delicious bottling. There is a deep density to the sip, where smoky flavors wrap around lavish black fruit, reminiscent of a pepper-crusted, teriyaki-soaked roast of beef."
US,88.0,35.0,New York,Millbrook,"Touches of balsamic vinegar, violet and wet granite lend complexity to this crisp, elegant Pinot Noir. Black cherry and plum flavors are penetrating and pristine, finishing with a fringe of dusty tannins."
US,90.0,40.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bargetto,"Sour cherry aromas mix with freshly turned black dirt and button mushrooms on this bottling from a winery that's been in the Santa Cruz Mountains for 80 years. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors of blackberry emerging first followed by pomegranate, roast pork and black pepper. Serve with beef in mushroom sauce."
US,91.0,35.0,El Dorado,A Donkey and Goat,"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2?? years of aging."
US,91.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"A bright, tart, spicy wine with plenty of grip and detail, this threads flavors of herb, stem and earth into the substantial blackberry and cassis fruit. It's nicely woven together, penetrating and punchy."
US,89.0,44.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Foxen,"With 15% alcohol by volume, this is the headiest of Foxen's new 2011 reds. A blend of Grenache and MourvÃ¨dre, it's fruity almost to the point of sweetness in raspberries and cherries, but turns dry and crisp on the finish. A delightful red wine to drink now with almost anything, and you can even put a little chill on it."
US,95.0,125.0,Alexander Valley,Devil Proof,"This vintage is even better than the prior version, which is almost unimaginable, but there it is. Floral and as tempting as blueberry pie, this concoction from Jesse Katz is velvety smooth and silky on the palate. White chocolate dances around its edges, along with a strong suggestion of cigar, which may perhaps come from the fine lady on the label."
Italy,87.0,55.0,Barbera d'Asti,Costa Olmo,"Here's a straight-laced Barbera d'Asti (aged in stainless steel) with linear aromas of berry fruit and cherry that appear in a direct and immediate manner. There's no great complexity here, nor is there supposed to be. This is a genuine expression of a fundamentally easy-drinking food wine."
US,91.0,30.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Bernat,"From a small vineyard in Los Olivos, this wine offers boysenberry, lavender, rosemary and a touch of oak on the nose. Intriguing pine tar, bay leaf and eucalyptus resin show on the palate, which gives depth to the deep black fruit."
Argentina,88.0,18.0,Mendoza,Melipal,"Lively from the beginning, with bright red berry aromas filling the definition of ?fruity.??Feels full and grabby, and very legit, with juicy blackberry fruit and a backing of toast and pepper."
Argentina,85.0,10.0,Mendoza,Carlos Basso,"A big step up from previous failures, this vintage shows tropical fruit aromas and some sea breeze. The flavors are of pineapple and tangerine, and the acidity is nice. On the finish, the fruit holds and the feel is right. Drink soon to capture the wine's perky freshness."
France,95.0,54.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 2017??030."
France,90.0,29.0,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,"There is a great balance between the natural floral and perfumed character of this GewÃ¼rztraminer and its lively acidity. These elements combine to form a wine that is complex and immediately attractive. It's ready to drink, but it can also age for a year."
Italy,85.0,16.0,Langhe,Villadoria,"This lean wine delivers oak sensations of espresso, vanilla, coffee bean and oak extract but the fruit has all dried up."
US,91.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Buty,"This wine brings aromas of pineapple, lemon drop, chamomile tea and custard to the bouquet. The flavors are ripe and full, showing a sense of texture and weight followed by a persistent finish."
France,91.0,22.0,Alsace,Willm,"A closed nose shows the faintest notes of quince. The palate is dry and fresh with lots of lemony zestiness. It's slender and clean with a wonderful, straightlaced backbone. Freshness and tautness signal a purposeful, lively wine, full of apple fruit and aromatic overtones of quince."
US,88.0,45.0,St. Helena,Casa Nuestra,"A field mix of seven varieties, this is a sanguine, thick and rich wine, softly layered in licorice, fig and cranberry, with a big presence on the palate. Dusty and leathery, it begs emphatically to be paired with pizza."
US,90.0,26.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Novelty Hill,"Cocoa powder, vanilla, toast and high-toned blue and black-fruit flavors are followed by a flavorful fruit-forward palate. It doesn't always seem entirely varietal but still brings plenty of appeal."
US,84.0,9.0,Mendocino,Parducci,"Pretty thin going, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc with its tart, citrusy fruit flavors and high acidity. Not a bad wine, but if you're looking for a rich, oaky Chardonnay, shop around."
France,95.0,45.0,Alsace,Jean Biecher & Fils,"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter?a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017??027."
US,86.0,14.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Firestone,"Squeezed lime, wet concrete and green apple rind scents show on the nose of this basic bottling. Kaffir lime tang meets with ripe red apple and pear notes on the palate, framed by a stony texture."
US,84.0,13.0,Monterey,Jekel,"Super-rich in tropical fruit, pineapple, apricot, pear and vanilla custard flavors, this is a useful, crowd-pleasing Chardonnay at an affordable price."
US,85.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Boysenberry, clove and wood spice aromas lead to tart, lightly styled fruit flavors that winnow toward the finish. The reserve designation seems hard to find."
US,93.0,50.0,Yakima Valley,CÃ´te Bonneville,"This Bordeaux-style blend includes 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot and 14% Cab Franc. It's a balanced and fine-tuned effort, with a lovely mix of tart, sleek, red and purple fruits. There's a nice underpinning of dried herb, ripe tannins, and a graceful, lingering finish. At almost six years of age, the wine remains fresh and lively."
US,88.0,35.0,Sonoma County,Viluko,"This medium-bodied, affordably priced wine offers a wealth of juicy red fruit with soft layers of tannin. It was aged in unobtrusive oak, 25% of it new."
US,92.0,40.0,Red Mountain,Mark Ryan,"Red Mountain fruit from three different sites is used to create this delicious Syrah, laced with powerful flavors of coffee liqueur and chocolate. Cofermented with a dash of Viognier, it's satiny and citrusy, speckled with pepper, and maintains an elegant precision for a wine that offers such richness."
US,91.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Brick & Mortar,"As salty as preserved lemon brine, this wine is medium-bodied, with integrated oak, having aged in 33% new French barrels. Golden delicious apple and a spicy bite of quince round out the subtle fruit flavors, bolstered by gravelly texture."
US,88.0,24.0,Sonoma County,Seghesio,"This large-production Zin has lots to like, beginning with the smooth, dry tannins and continuing through the classic flavors of black currants, briary forest berries and exotic spices. It contains some Petite Sirah, which gives it added body and depth. Drink now with barbecue, beef tacos and pepperoni pizza."
Italy,88.0,61.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Corte Lenguin,"La Coeta is a massive wine that will appeal to those who appreciate a heavy oak element and dense extraction. Either way, you'll need to give this hearty Amarone a few more years to find balance. In the mouth, it sports dark fruit aromas and thick, chewy astringency."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Copertino,Apollonio,"Aromas of oak, espresso, steeped plum and cracked pepper lead the nose on this blend of 70% Negroamaro, 20% Montepulciano and 10% Malvasia Nera. The palate offers raspberry jam, clove, allspice and roasted coffee bean alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins. It ends on a note of bitter prune. Drink through 2017."
France,87.0,20.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Patache d'Aux,"Densely tannic, this is a wine that shows some initial austerity, although the black currant fruit and toasty wood then comes through. With its structure and chewy texture, it is always likely to be a firm wine."
Italy,92.0,58.0,Bolgheri Superiore,Tenuta I Greppi,"This shows bold oak tones of toast and spice that will unwind with 3?? more years of bottle age. Beyond the notes of cinnamon and tobacco, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc shows austerity and complexity, with touches of dark plum and tangy barbecue sauce. Give it a few more years."
US,88.0,23.0,Alexander Valley,Clos du Bois,"Clos du Bois continues their effort with this great red variety of Spain, and the '05 is their best yet. It's like a good Zinfandel, except not as full-bodied, with spicy black pepper, cherry and currant flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Could even improve with a few years in the bottle."
US,91.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Falcone,"Warm touches of lemon-laced chamomile tea, soft butter and a dollop of orange sherbert show on the nose of this intriguing and unique wine from the Sierra Madre Vineyard. There's a strong sense of baking soda-like alkalinity to the palate, laced through juicy lemon and tangerine flavors, pithy grip, slate minerality and a mouth-watering combo of acidity and salt."
US,86.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gordon Brothers,"A young wine from a high-acid year, and it's showing a fair amount of earth and green, herbal flavor. The fruit seems just on the edge of ripe, with hints of brambly berry. Well balanced in a tough year."
France,93.0,50.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Canon la GaffeliÃ¨re,"This is the flagship wine from the mini-empire (now comprising five properties) that is controlled by Comte Stephan von Niepperg. He has made a modern, wood dominated wine, with rich, concentrated black fruits. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, lacking a sense of the usual grace of this estate, although the ripeness of the wine does compensate."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Primitivo di Manduria,Giordano,"Here's a hot, jammy Primitivo that has all the heat of the Southern Italian sun locked within. The wine boasts luscious dark concentration and a sweet, syrupy nose with spice, oak and tobacco. You can feel the heat in the mouth and the wine is soft and incredibly chewy to the touch. If you love big and bold wines, this is for you."
France,88.0,16.0,Luberon,Marrenon,"The high altitude vineyards of Luberon can yield some thirst-quenching rosÃ©s, of which this is a very good example. Hints of crushed stone and barely-ripe peaches finish on a refreshing note of fresh lime juice. Drink now."
US,93.0,85.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cayuse,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of ash, raw meat, smoke, herb, stem, blood orange and mineral. The palate brings a sense of freshness to the generous savory flavors, showing a bit of tannic heft on the finish that should settle with additional time in the bottle."
Italy,90.0,64.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Romeo,"New leather, pressed blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of game are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut, structured red. The palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and vanilla flavors, while assertive, close-grained tannins give the finish grip. Give this time to let those tannins mellow. Drink 2018??026."
France,82.0,20.0,Alsace,Wunsch & Mann,"A bitter wine with tart apple and pear flavors, this has a hard edge. Drink now."
US,91.0,34.0,Red Mountain,Doyenne,"Roussanne, with barely seven years history in Washington, is making good headway, thanks to efforts such as this. It seems to capture the floral and citrus complexity of the best Viogniers, while adding in richer layers of fruit through a pleasingly honeyed middle. Lively and lingering, it has the balance and depth to improve in bottle over the next four or five years."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Primitivo di Manduria,Produttori Vini Manduria,"Aromas of dried Marasca cherry and raspberry jam lead the nose on this smooth dessert wine. The soft, polished palate delivers fig, candied date and carob while a cocoa note backs up the lingering finish."
US,85.0,16.0,Monterey County,Francis Ford Coppola,"Canned cranberry sauce and Indian spices collide on the nose. Light in color, it feels tad sweet once sipped, thanks to juicy flavors of strawberry and cherry."
US,88.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Anglim,"Extremely lifting and fluffy aromas of grape soda, very ripe olallieberries and nearly a bubblegum element arise on the nose of this accessible wine, which will appeal to lovers of many varietals. It's similarly poppy and easy to sip on the palate, with a strong acidic zing."
US,91.0,20.0,Sonoma-Napa-Lake,Summers,"This is a stunning wine at this price, sourced mainly from Sonoma County-based vineyards, with another 19% of the grapes from Lake County and 16% from Napa. It includes other Bordeaux red varieties in the mix, as well as tiny amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Medium bodied and dusty in tannin, with dried herb tones, it's structured, velvety and finishes on a dark chocolate note."
US,87.0,11.0,Monterey,Hess,"There's very little if any oak on this wine, which has a classic Central Coast profile of high acidity and bright, intense fruit. The flavors of limes, kiwis, passionfruit and vanilla finish long and bright. Good value in a classy, superdrinkable Chardonnay."
France,90.0,51.0,Champagne,Charles Ellner,"A taut, mineral wine with a domiNAce of Chardonnay to give the crispest citrus and a very textured feel. Definitely dry, the wine, not from a classic vintage year, seems still young and all fruit, so it would be worth aging for 3?? years."
US,91.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Twomey,"This is a fresh, young Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and ripe flavors of raspberries and cola. It's dry and deliciously complex, a fine example of a coastal Pinot, and should hold and develop over the next six years."
Australia,87.0,20.0,Barossa,Rosedale Wines,"A fruit-driven Cabernet, with cheerful, bright cherry-berry flavors. Tannins are firm but ripe, accenting the cassis-tinged close with a slightly dusty texture."
US,87.0,30.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"Round and ripe frangipani, jasmine, honeysuckle and white peach aromas contribute to the pretty nose of this bottling, even though they feel as confected as bubblegum. There is a vibrant energy to the palate, which is rich in poached pear, baked apple, dried ginger and caramel flavors. Over the top but pleasant."
France,85.0,22.0,Beaujolais Blanc,ChÃ¢teau de Chatelard,"The wine is all about fresh apples and pears, with just a hint of smokiness and mineral texture. Crisp, with great acidity, it's ready to drink now, bright, full in the mouth and very fruity."
Italy,89.0,33.0,Chianti Classico,Fietri,"A blend of 89% Sangiovese, 11% Merlot and Alicante, this wine offers fruity, earthy aromas of wet soil, tobacco leaf and hints of truffle. The structured palate delivers plum and black cherry layered with notes of espresso, oak and chocolate. It's fresh with youthful tannins. Drink through 2020."
France,85.0,20.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Liversan,"One of the estates in the Lapalu family stable, Liversan is to the west of Pauillac. In 2013 it has produced a light, fruity wine with attractive acidity and some dry tannins. Unfocused at this stage, it hopefully will develop a richer character as it matures. Drink from 2017."
US,92.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Sante Arcangeli,"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip."
US,90.0,19.0,Lake County,Bodkin,"This delicious spicy white has an almost Latin flair. It smells like mango and cilantro, tastes crisp and peachy, and finishes with a sensation of mild chili peppers. It's fun to encounter something so arresting and unusual to drink."
Spain,89.0,14.0,Cava,Sonim,"Another good bubbly from Sonim, this red-colored sparkler is dry on the nose, with cherry and cassis aromas. It feels round and full as it shows off bright raspberry and plum flavors in front of a healthy, smooth finish. Much darker in color than most rosÃ© Cavas."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Chianti Rufina,I Veroni,"Made entirely from organically grown Sangiovese, this opens with red plum, new leather and underbrush aromas. The full-bodied palate delivers crushed raspberry, black cherry, pipe tobacco and a hint of black pepper, with polished tannins providing backbone. Drink through 2022."
France,86.0,15.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Grand Bourgeau,"This wine is smoky and juicy, with swathes of attractive black currant fruit. It's lightly structured, crisp and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2018."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Rioja,Burgo Viejo,"This Rioja opens with a jumpy, lively, candied red-fruit aroma. It feels solid, rubbery and stout, with dark fruit flavors that are accented by mild resin and butter notes. Feels a little sticky on the finish, with firm tannins."
US,87.0,20.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Amador Foothill Winery,"At a time when many others have dropped Sangiovese from their portfolios, Amador Foothill remains committed to the great grape of Tuscany. The wine is medium-bodied and soft, somewhat like a warm-climate Merlot, with a pepper edge to the cherry and red currant flavors. It finishes dry and elegant."
US,86.0,40.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Furthermore,"A little too soft, which gives a flat, lifeless quality to the mouthfeel. On the other hand, the flavors are wonderful, ranging from cherries and currants to an exquisite overlay of oak. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere, so drink up."
US,86.0,13.0,California,Dancing Derby,"A good, off-dry useful wine for drinking across the board with a wide variety of fare, or by itself as a cocktail. It's brisk and clean, with pleasant citrus, apricot, spice and vanilla flavors."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,"Spunky raspberry aromas give this Tempranillo-led blend a fresh bouquet. The palate is snappy, a little high in acidity, and plenty zippy, with plum and cherry flavors. Finishes with length and some scour. Nice for everyday drinking; best with basic foods."
US,80.0,22.0,Lodi,Michael David,"A blend of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this is a clumsy wine. It's soft and overripe, and the oaky overlay doesn't do anything to improve the situation."
Argentina,88.0,13.0,Mendoza,Benegas,"Solid dark-berry aromas are dense and deep. This has a plump forward fruity palate with concentrated, toasty flavors of blackberry and dark plum. On the finish, this remains fruity and compact, with more than enough body weight."
US,86.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Peachy Canyon,"Strong and ripe with Zinny flavor??intense wild berry and cherry fruit as well as a briary, brambly mouthfeel. High alcohol gives it a glycerine richness."
France,83.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau l'Oasis,"This orange-pink colored wine is so soft and gentle that it ends up with little flavor at all. It has acidity, hints of apricot and pear, with a little spice at the end."
US,90.0,56.0,Napa Valley,AuburnJames,"This wine includes all five traditional red-Bordeaux varieties, Merlot the most dominant, resulting in tart Bing cherry and cassis flavors. It doesn't hold back on tannin or power, showing grippy persistence on the finish."
US,87.0,33.0,Willamette Valley,Fullerton,"Still a bit fragmented, this offers a core of tight apple and peach fruit. It was barrel fermented (10% new) and that shell of barrel flavors has not yet smoothed into the fruit. Give it brisk aeration or another year in the bottle."
US,88.0,36.0,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Winery,"Merlot dominant with a balance of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows aromas of vanilla, coconut and jammy red and black fruit, with the alcohol poking through. The fruit flavors feel supple, backed by gritty tannins."
France,87.0,15.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,Commanderie de la Bargemone,"A consistent performer, the rosÃ© under the Commanderie de la Bargemone label is a fresh, medium-bodied wine that features enticing aromas of white chocolate and cherries. Modest cherry flavors finish crisp and citrusy, giving this wine excellent refreshment value."
US,92.0,38.0,San Luis Obispo County,Stephen Ross,"This wine, from veteran winemaker Steve Dooley, shows an herbal side on the nose, with charred pine prominent, alongside licorice and dried strawberries. The palate combines cranberry and pomegranate with healthy amounts of sage."
Spain,89.0,16.0,Rueda,Naia,"Peach and apple aromas are clean and fresh. In the mouth, this offers a nice blend of citric acidity and peachy roundness. Flavors of mango, grapefruit and passion fruit finish steady. In general, everything about this Verdejo is easy to like."
Italy,92.0,65.0,Faro,Palari,"Loaded with personality and special distinguishing qualities, this blend of Nocera, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio is a wine for those interested in Italy's indigenous grapes. The bouquet is complex and layered with notes of bramble, forest berry, cassis, cola, dried ginger and green curry. The mouthful is tight, structured and streamlined."
US,90.0,28.0,El Dorado,Donkey & Goat,"This medium-bodied wine walks its own path, smelling like flowers, honey and ripe peaches. It tastes fresh, nicely tart, lightly tannic and floral, making for an adventurous and energizing path to take."
France,86.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bois Pertuis,"While this wine does have firm tannins, it also offers a ripe, fruity backdrop that will develop. At the moment, the wine is dry and dense. Give it a few months for the red fruits to broaden out. Drink from mid-2016."
US,87.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Bell,"Claret is the old-fashioned word for Bordeaux, but it has no legal meaning in the U.S. This Cabernet-based wine contains some Syrah, which gives a smoked meat or bacon note to the blackberries and black currants. It's delicious, if a little sweet."
France,90.0,20.0,Languedoc,Mas Belles Eaux,"Vibrant and juicy with red cherry and blueberry playing well alongside notes of thyme and soft pepper spice. Medium weight in the mouth with soft grain tannins, solid acidity, and a finish that leaves a delicious raspberry syrup flavor lingering until the next sip. Drink now or hold for a year."
France,89.0,30.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau Tour de Bessan,"Like many wines from Marie-Laure Lurton, this is dry and shows its firm tannic and wood character. Here the wood verges on too much, giving an austere, hard character. However, the black currant fruit will come through, giving a dry wine that will have some richness. Drink from 2018."
US,89.0,22.0,Monterey,San Simeon,"The winery has held this wine back for nearly three years, but it's still briskly acidic and clean. Grown in the Arroyo Seco appellation, it shows forward, bright flavors of tangerines, mangoes and Asian pears, with complexities from oak and lees aging."
US,83.0,20.0,Sonoma Coast,MooBuzz,"A bit unrefined, with candied pear, apricot jam and oak flavors and a soft texture. Feels heavy, instead of lively."
France,90.0,16.0,Vouvray,Domaine de Vaugondy,"This ripe, complex wine offers a delicate combination of apple, lemon and honey, with a mineral texture. Balanced already although likely to age well, it is full of fruit, with a more steely texture at the end. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be better to wait until 2018."
US,92.0,175.0,Rutherford,Patel,"Medium in weight and structure, this wine shows a tempting leanness at first, balancing its ripeness with complex notions of clove, cola and black cherry. Twisted in tannin and oak on the midpalate, its youthfulness on full display, it has a succulent finish."
US,87.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Fetzer,"Making strides for admittance to the Big Boy?s Club is Fetzer, with reserve wines like this. A plush, complex, elegant beauty, with classic Bien Nacido notes of sun-dried tomatoes, hard spices and black-cherry fruit, with the required French oak influences. It?s a young wine that needs a year or so to open up."
US,86.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Light plum and cherry flavors give a good first impression. The blend is not strictly traditional, with small doses of Syrah and Grenache in the mix. It fades quickly, and it shows some sourness on the finish."
US,92.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"This single vineyard Malbec belongs with Washington's best. The mix of purple fruits and intense barrel flavors of clove, cocoa and dusty mocha inspires an impromptu ?wow??once in the mouth. Smooth, satiny and seamless, it has a gentle hint of earth and herb threaded through the finish."
US,90.0,47.0,Russian River Valley,V. Sattui,"Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice."
France,88.0,23.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Provence Wine Maker,"It's the play on roses (the flowers) on the label that makes this bottle seem bright and fun. The wine itself is light and fruity with ripe flavors from the lees aging. There is spice, plenty of acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
US,88.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Angel Vine,"There's no question of the variety of this wine with its notes of raspberry jam, plum and herbs. It's full bodied with a mixture of fruit and spice flavors, running hot on the finish."
US,90.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Quivira,"This is a producer always to consider for RhÃ´ne-styled wines. A mix of strawberry pie and Nilla wafer, this 100% varietal wine is robust and full bodied. Structured with plenty of tangy acidity, it'll stand up to cellaring or a decant. Drink now through 2021."
US,88.0,24.0,Paso Robles,True Myth,"This widely available bottling by the Niven family is a very safe and reliable expression of Cab, with black plums, crushed slate, a touch of oak, some purple flowers and a little soy on the nose. The palate is also down the middle, with earth, wood and dark fruit all present, framed by strong acidity and firm but not overwhelming tannins."
France,83.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Bellevue Peycharneau,"The wine is dominated by extracted wood flavors. It is likely to soften, but not enough to allow the fruit to sing."
US,86.0,18.0,Santa Barbara County,The Federalist,"An ode to the founding fathers, this bottling is quite tight on the nose, with lime skin, lime blossom and Meyer-lemon juice aromas. The palate offers apple skins, crisp apple flesh, lemon-tinged butter, grapefruit zest and a shaving of vanilla."
US,88.0,50.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Firestone,"This hearty blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Cabernet Franc, 24% Merlot and 14% Petit Verdot offers blackberry, smoked beef, vanilla, cola and anise scents on the nose. The palate is tightly wound, its boysenberry fruit and dark soil minerality leading into a finish laced with licorice spice."
US,85.0,38.0,Mendocino County,Kimmel,"In a gigantically heavy bottle, this Mendocino Merlot, grown in the Potter Valley, struggles to eke out currant and cranberry aromas and is perfectly fine but lacking in depth and vibrancy."
France,89.0,80.0,Pommard,Manuel Olivier,"This firm wine fits well with the image of Pommard. A tannic core contrasts with the potential of the red cherry fruits. Wood aging is still prominent, and the wine needs time to balance out. Drink from 2017."
US,86.0,17.0,Central Coast,Edna Valley Vineyard,"Light olallieberry juice mixes with wet-slate minerality on the nose of this widely available wine. It's a bit simple, but also light and easy to quaff, with a blueberry-blackberry juice core enhanced by dried oregano."
US,85.0,12.0,California,Leese-Fitch,"Rich, savory and seemingly slightly sweet, this Chardonnay has acidity that provides balance to the rich flavors of tangerines, golden mangoes, limes and honey. Drink this with Chinese or Vietnamese fare."
US,86.0,22.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Bella Piazza,"Subdued on the nose, this has a good concentration of fruit and a strong structure, buoyed by firm acidity. The finish is long and lingering."
US,89.0,14.0,Mendocino County,Bonterra,"Aromas and flavors of fresh, crisp, green apples and golden cherries seem to light up this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It has firm acidity, a refreshing texture, and just enough heft in the body to serve with appetizers and cheese, but will also stand up to rich seafood preparations."
France,88.0,40.0,Santenay,Domaine Jessiaume,"Lightly wood-flavored wine, emphasizing also the ripe peach and quince flavors. There is a spicy touch, just a sprinkling of nutmeg, the wine ripe and full."
France,86.0,28.0,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,"Spice and cream dominate this attractive wine. With its full flavors of spice and pear, there is a also a hint of flower. An attractive wine that is developing quickly."
US,86.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Rodney Strong,"Rich and herbal in cranberry and cherry, this is a soft and approachable wine that's been tamed yet manages to retain a spicy, clove and cardamom edge."
Italy,89.0,35.0,Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze,Mionetto,"This offers aromas of jasmine, hawthorn and ripe pear. The round palate delivers creamy green apple, white peach, tangerine zest and a note of honeyed almond accompanied by racy acidity and a foaming mousse."
US,94.0,62.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Clos de la Tech,"This winery atop the mountains overlooking Silicon Valley makes amazingly earthy and age-worthy wines. This bottling's nose is soil-driven, with sun-baked loam laid across red cherry, condensed lilacs, cola and sandalwood aromas. The sip is structured firmly and strategically like the frame of a well-built home, where dark mulberry and savory spices reside. Drink now??028."
US,89.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),North by Northwest,"Sourced from Les Collines Vineyard in Walla Walla and Wallula Benches Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, this engaging Syrah features firm, ripe fruit, brown spice and a strong streak of cola. It's drinking quite well and is fully integrated, so enjoy it soon rather than cellaring it for later."
US,89.0,62.0,Red Mountain,Sparkman,"The Kingpin Cabernet leans into the flavors of savory herb and leaf, with peppery accents to the light strawberry fruit. It's a pleasant, relatively light style that fades into a gentle finish."
Australia,87.0,14.0,Langhorne Creek,Bleasdale,"There aren't many white wines coming out of Langhorne Creek, but this Verdelho is a good one, offering crisp, citrusy notes of pear and pineapple, medium body and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now."
Italy,91.0,34.0,Chianti Classico,Tenuta di Arceno,"Bright cherry and wild berry are lavished in thick layers, adding intensity and persistency. This modern Chianti Classico is 20% (the maximum allowed) Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Bright acidity and vibrant berry flavors characterize the mouth and fuel a lasting fruity impression that would pair well with meat-based pasta or risotto."
France,84.0,20.0,Languedoc,Domaine Sainte Croix,"Soft notes of sweet grass and garrigue herbs accent the fruity tones of small red berries, watermelon rinds and lime peels on the nose of this light, fresh wine. The palate is tart and bright, with ample acidity and a short finish."
France,86.0,18.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,ChÃ¢teau de BeauprÃ©,"A soft wine, it has a rounded, open texture and offers red fruits, an attractively aromatic character and fresh acidity at the end."
US,89.0,46.0,Paso Robles,Daou,"Crushed cloves, black cherry and brandy aromas greet the nose on this blend of 64% Syrah, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Petit Verdot. Blackberry juice flavors dominate the palate, picking up complexity from bay leaf, anise, marjoram and chaparral elements."
France,95.0,40.0,Vouvray,Domaine Vincent CarÃªme,"From an organic parcel of vines, this floral and honey-flavored wine is superbly rich. The 12 months in wood adds spice and a touch of toast as well as giving the wine a delicious oxidative edge. It is an opulent wine, hinting at honey, with ripe melon and quince flavors. Drink this impressive wine from 2021."
Italy,85.0,11.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,Fattoria della Talosa,"This pretty rosso has typical fragrances of dark fruit and spice. The palate shows ripe plum and cherry layered with cinnamon notes. It's fresh and ready to enjoy now, and would pair well with pasta dishes or grilled chicken."
Italy,90.0,34.0,Morellino di Scansano,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini,"This Riserva Morellino offers a wonderful bouquet of bright cherry, mature blackberry, plum and light spice. You feel the warm sunshine of southern Tuscany here thanks to the wine's natural thickness and intensity."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Puglia,Tommasi,"Pretty aromas of white spring flower, sage and apple lead the nose on this blend of 90% Fiano and 10% Chardonnay. The palate offers green apple, nectarine and lime alongside fresh acidity."
Spain,88.0,13.0,Pla de Bages,Masies d'Avinyo,"Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc aren't often thrown together, but here the marriage works. The nose offers herbal, leafy aromas from the CF, while berry fruit and oak carry the rest of the show. The palate is slightly crisp and racy, but its lightweight character is welcome. This is yet another well-made, interesting wine from one of our favorite obscure Spanish labels."
France,86.0,14.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Pierre and Charles Sparr,"This is only Brut in name, because it is actually a medium-sweet wine that maintains pear freshness. It's ripe, full in the mouth and ready to drink."
US,85.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (OR),Styring,"This high-toned bruiser pushes ultraripe scents of figs and raisins and prunes to the front, yet shows a green streak in the tannins. The wine spent 34 months in barrel, which adds more heavy-duty accents but does not mask the underlying stemminess."
Italy,87.0,35.0,Bolgheri Superiore,Campo al Mare,"This brawny blend of 90% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot offers subdued aromas of raisin, black currant, bell pepper and a whiff of menthol. The evolved palate offers toast, coffee and hints of dried black fruit alongside the warmth of evident alcohol."
US,93.0,70.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Serene,"Showing more toast than butter, this is a firm, concisely knit and dense wine. Very ripe flavors of apple and peach are wrapped in a frame of toasty oak and caramel. Decadent and delicious, it rewards some extra breathing time and can be cellared 2021??023."
US,86.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Van Duzer,"There's an odd smell of roasted peanuts under the citrusy fruit aromas, but once in the mouth the fruit takes over big time. It bursts forth, apples and lemons, and stays solid and unchanging into the tart finish."
US,86.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Sterling,"Ripe and deep in berry, currant, cassis and spice flavors, with a rich overlay of cedary oak. Shows some roughness in midpalate and tannic astringency on the finish. Good, but edgy and a little harsh. Contains some Petite Sirah and Syrah."
Italy,91.0,17.0,Sicilia,Barone di Villagrande,"Merlot and Nerello Mascalese make for perfect blending partners, creating a wine with cherry softness and bright fruit intensity, plus volcanic minerality and elegance. Polished and clean on the finish."
France,88.0,45.0,Champagne,Le Grix de la Salle,"Dry and crisp, this is dominated by apple flavor. It's light in texture, attractively fruity and has a youthful feel to it. It could age a few months in bottle."
US,87.0,28.0,Wahluke Slope,Camaraderie,"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season."
US,90.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"A banner vintage delivers a wine with nicely delineated layers of flavor, from fleshy tropical fruit into streaks of slightly bitter-skin flavors, herb and banana cream pie. It's long, lush and deliciously lively."
France,87.0,45.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau les Anguilleys,"A fruity and juicy wine, it also has a stalky, herbal element. That gives a fresh character to the wine while also showing lightness. The black currant fruits are strong and forward, with a hint of maturity that suggests this is for medium-term aging."
US,89.0,27.0,Santa Barbara County,Prospect 772,"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality."
France,91.0,35.0,Sancerre,Daniel Chotard,Old vines are the source of this ripe tropical-fruit-flavored wine. It is concentrated and dense with a flinty texture that is taut and nervy. There is a crisp aftertaste that gives the wine its delicious lift. Drink the wine now.
France,88.0,25.0,Vouvray,Alexandre Monmousseau,"This soft wine has fresh acidity that lifts the peppered pear flavors. It's ready to drink, very fruity while keeping its mineral and chalky texture. The aftertaste is ripe and also fresh."
US,83.0,30.0,North Coast,Loft,"This medium-bodied wine is dry and crisp, showing light dried herb, celery and nut aromas. Lively citrus flavors are tinged with earthiness and a tangy texture."
France,92.0,30.0,Alsace,Paul Blanck,"The heady scent of Damask rose rises from the glass. The peach on the rich, soft and mellow palate is bathed in rose scent too. Residual sweetness boosts the perfumed aspect of this wine, bringing lychee and peach into play as well. A lovely phenolic edge provides structure and fluidity on this textbook Gewurztraminer. The finish is off dry."
Italy,93.0,70.0,Barbaresco,Carlo Giacosa,"This tight and energetic wine opens with menthol, new leather, wild berry, blue flower and grilled herb aromas. The focused palate mirrors the nose, offering juicy sour cherry, cranberry, star anise and clove flavors framed by youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity."
US,92.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Vina Robles,"Paso Robles is achieving fame for its offbeat white blends, and this wine is a perfect example of why. Made from Viognier, Verdelho, Vermentino and Sauvignon Blanc, it's one of the most beautifully drinkable whites on the market today, at a great price. Brisk acidity, a steely minerality and mouthwatering citrus fruit combine with richer, riper notes of nectarine and peach to produce a vibrant wine."
France,89.0,80.0,Alsace,Josmeyer,"There's not too much fruit going on here; the aromas and flavors tend more towards caramel, vanilla and cinnamon, with just a faint lemon tone as a backdrop. After a kiss of softness on the palate, this wine finishes with mouthwatering crispness. Though impressive, this wine is a bit disjointed and could use a few years to integrate."
US,92.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Bjornstad,"Zesty acidity and the flavors of green apples, pears and mangoes combine to make this Chardonnay attractive and food friendly. It has a creamy smokiness that adds to the richness. Drink it now with elaborate shellfish dishes."
US,91.0,17.0,Lodi,Black Saint Peter,"An earthy, black-pepper aroma and classic blackberry, raspberry and brambly spice components make this a fine example of Zinfandel. It is full bodied, mouthfilling and generous in flavor, benefitting from good acidity and moderate, fine-grained tannins for structure."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Terre Siciliane,Cusumano,"A blend of 70% Insolia and 30% Chardonnay, this easy-drinking wine has apple, peach, pear and citrus sensations. The round, juicy palate is one-dimensional but easy to enjoy."
US,92.0,25.0,Edna Valley,Windemere,"There's a nice dollop of warm butter on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975, but it's well restrained and enhanced by vanilla yogurt and graphite aromas. A crushed sea-shell minerality shines on the palate, where apple flesh, graphite and lemon rinds combine for a full sipping experience."
US,90.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Eternal,"Walla Walla Valley-designated white wines are a rarity. This one brings aromas of apple skin and pear, showing a very clean profile that leads to dry creamy-feeling fruit flavors. It's capped off by a warm finish, speckled with barrel accents. Overall, it provides a lot of intrigue."
US,91.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Wild Ridge,"From the producer's Annapolis vineyard, planted at 700 to 900 feet, this is a floral, spicy and high-toned wine. It shows pomegranate, plum and a noticeable streak of forest among its highlights, the tannins integrated and kept fresh and structured by the acidity."
US,89.0,50.0,McMinnville,Maysara,"This cuvÃ©e is made with the oldest block in this biodynamic vineyard. Planted in 1998, all Pommard clone, and given some extra bottle age, it's drinking well at the moment. Spicy cranberry-raspberry soda flavors come with a textural midpalate. There is a significant scent and flavor of tanned leather, which pleases some tasters more than others. That aside, the wine is complex, balanced and reasonably long."
Spain,83.0,50.0,Rioja,Bodegas Valdemar,"The palate is big and cushioned, but the flavors are green, stewy and herbal. With carob and some veggies on the finish, there isn't convincing ripeness to this wine."
US,83.0,7.0,California,CK Mondavi,"This Merlot defines the concept of party wine. It's clean, crisp and ripe, with cherries, cola and toast notes."
US,90.0,60.0,Sonoma County-Napa County,Eleanor,"Named for the documentary filmmaker, artist and wife of Francis Ford Coppola, Eleanor blends Syrah and Petite Sirah from Rutherford with Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley and Syrah from Dry Creek Valley to form a rich, red, extracted wine generously succulent in cranberry and dark cherry. Licorice, tar and tobacco add to the complexity and flavor."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Primitivo di Manduria,Leone de Castris,"Villa Santera is a well-priced Primitivo di Manduria with jammy notes of black fruit, mature apple, root beer and spice. The wine has a dense, rich texture and a bright endnote of cherry fruit flavors."
Spain,87.0,17.0,Cigales,Calderona,"From the Frutos Villar bodega comes this friendly if a bit lean reserva with cherry, leather, and rubber aromas and a snappy, clean palate of cherry and raspberry fruit. The finish is lightweight and pure, and slightly warming, while overall it comes across fresh and solid, with just enough oak to give it heft and substance."
US,87.0,13.0,Sonoma County,Lyeth,"Rich and delicious, this has flavors of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie, buttered toast and smoky butterscotch that are balanced by fine acidity and dry, firm minerality."
Italy,93.0,125.0,Barolo,Mirafiore,"This is a lovely wine that very much lives up to the power and thickness associated with Barolo from the Serralunga d'Alba subzone. It opens with big, sweet tones of mature fruit, vanilla spice, dark cola and toasted hazelnut. It feels wonderful in the mouth as well, thanks to the softness and richness of its texture."
France,89.0,26.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Rahoul,"Chocolate and licorice flavors dominate this solid, foursquare yet austere wine. Its offers firm fruit, with a dense texture of black currant and red plum. Acidity and a spice note set off the finish."
US,92.0,40.0,Monterey,DeTierra Vineyards,"Grown sustainably on land between the Santa Lucia Highlands and Carmel, this great-smelling wine shows light caramel apple and sea salt on the nose. There's a judicious touch of butter to the palate, where flavors of green pear and lemon zest leave the mouth watering with acidity long into the finish."
France,89.0,30.0,Sancerre,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin,"This is the entry-level wine from this producer. Following the vintage, it is rich, juicy with white fruits as well as citrus and already refreshing. There is an attractive bite of minerality at the end. Drink now."
US,93.0,68.0,Paso Robles,Venteux,"Luscious, intoxicating aromas of crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, vanilla liqueur and Bourbon barrel lift up ample purple and blue fruits on this rich wine from a 22-acre family vineyard. The mouthfeel is accordingly velvety, with plum flavors most prevalent. The three years of new French oak Ã©levage  play a central yet nicely integrated role."
Italy,88.0,95.0,Chianti Classico,Il Molino di Grace,"Stewed prune, scorched earth, leather, menthol and leafy underbrush aromas set the tone. The ripe, jammy palate offers dried black cherry, clove and anise framed in densely packed, dusty tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unfold but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
Spain,88.0,18.0,MÃ¡laga,Jorge OrdÃ³Ã±ez & Co.,"Lychee and minerally aromas amount to a pleasant whole. This dry, still Moscatel is texturally round and oily, while flavors of melon, lychee and orange are a touch bitter around the edges and on the finish."
US,92.0,34.0,Contra Costa County,Three,"An abundance of fresh fruit spills out of this full-bodied, pure and uncomplicated wine in a way that's hard to resist. There is little obvious oak to get in the way of flavors like vine-ripened raspberries and blackberries as they stream along on fine tannins and lithe acidity."
US,91.0,64.0,Napa Valley,Pine Ridge,"This is a silky-smooth and integrated wine, with firm, structured tannins that provide support without distracting. A wealth of brawny baked berry, tar and chocolate flavors reveal themselves over time, while subtle, deep clove and dried herb scents lie beneath."
US,86.0,19.0,El Dorado County,Due Vigne,"Grown at 2,400-feet elevation from Italian budwood, this Dolcetto, so common to Piedmont but almost unheard of in California, is muy grande, with mountainous tannins and flavors of coffee and toffee and bright notes of cranberry and cherry."
Australia,93.0,69.0,Barossa,Langmeil,"Appropriately youthful and flashy, this is textbook Barossa Shiraz, full bodied and rich. Dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids support dark berry fruit, cedar and vanilla. It's drinkable now, but should add savoriness over the next 10 or more years."
Italy,88.0,28.0,Chianti Classico,Bonacchi,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this begins with leafy aromas that burn off in the glass to reveal underbrush, black berries, spice and a whiff of espresso. The palate offers up succulent wild cherry layered with cinnamon and a note of milk chocolate. It's extremely approachable, almost forward, so enjoy soon."
Italy,86.0,21.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Giuseppe Lonardi,"This selection opens with aromas of blackberry and black pepper, along with whiffs of oak and vanilla. It has a chewy palate, with well-integreated oak and a black-cherry core accented by a hint of chocolate. The finish is somewhat abrupt."
Italy,95.0,88.0,Friuli,Lis Neris,"Tal LÃ¹c comes in an elegant little bottle that beautifully sets the stage for the fabulous dessert wine to follow. The color is deeply golden and saturated and aromas include toasted almond, dried yellow rose, candied fruit and apricot. The creamy texture would pair with something different than dessert, say a delicate sliver of duck liver pÃ¢tÃ©."
US,88.0,34.0,Oak Knoll District,PiÃ±a,"This lovely, creamy and medium-bodied expression of pineapple offers a touch of ginger spice as it goes along. From a cooler area of the Napa Valley, the wine never gets sloppy in its use of oak, allowing the fruit and acidity to speak."
Italy,88.0,12.0,Sicilia,Principi di Spadafora,"Winemaker Francesco Spadafora shows his deft hand with Syrah in this easygoing wine. It has intensity and complexity, with layers of spice, red cherry, leather and black pepper."
Argentina,81.0,9.0,Mendoza,Bodega Privada,"This is so ripe it smells like raisin extract and prune juice. A murky, stewy palate and overt raisiny flavors finish with a rubbery, tannic feel. Acceptable but with glaring weaknesses."
US,92.0,56.0,Russian River Valley,Benovia,"If you're looking for a gorgeous Pinot to drink now, here it is. The wine is dry and silky and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, red currant, licorice, cola and sandalwood flavors. Tastes elegant and complex. Now??013."
France,90.0,28.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Domaine du Fief aux Dames,"This comes from a single vineyard that is owned by several growers but whose fruit is made into a single wine. It is rich, ripe and fruity, a powerful and full-bodied Muscadet. It has spice as well as citrus fruitiness and a rounded texture. Some aging has really improved this wine."
US,95.0,55.0,Alexander Valley,Rodney Strong,"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years."
US,92.0,42.0,Red Mountain,Kiona,"This Cabernet-based blend offers lovely black cherry flavors and scents of violet, with a hint of licorice and substantial, ripe tannins on the palate. It can age for at least another 6?? years, though it's drinking quite nicely already."
France,92.0,27.0,Madiran,Alain Brumont,"A powerful, impressive wine. It combines dark, brooding tannins and firm fruits with such an elegant structure and texture. Solid and full of juicy black-plum flavors, it finishes with dry yet voluptuous tannins."
France,88.0,25.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Pilet,A ripe and rich wine that is structured with tannins and layers of wood. It has spice and black-fruit flavors that make it a rich wine with potential. Drink from 2018.
France,86.0,24.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bel Orme Martial,This is a balanced wine with fine young tannins and plenty of blackberry and black-plum fruits. It is ripe while keeping plenty of acidity. The wine is going to develop well and should be ready from 2019.
US,90.0,46.0,Napa Valley,S. Anderson,"The lightest and most delicate of Anderson?s trio of bubblies this year, this 100% Chardonnay offers clean aromas of coconut, vanilla, lime peel and toast, and drinks fresh and lively. It?s also very dry, and finishes with a slightly bitter almond-skin note."
US,88.0,28.0,El Dorado,Skinner,"A relatively light color and aromas like cherry jam give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. It has fruit flavors that dig deeper than the aromas, and moderate tannins for a good, gripping mouthfeel."
France,87.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Peneau,"This ripe, juicy wine is packed with red fruit. Its tannins are already soft, suggesting it will age quickly. With its crisp aftertaste and plenty of fruitiness, it will be best from 2019."
Australia,87.0,20.0,Clare Valley,Pauletts,"A lean, crisp style of Chardonnay, with citrusy flavors and a touch of honeyed development. Drink it over the next few months."
US,92.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Pahlmeyer,"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now??012."
Argentina,85.0,20.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Wiry, rugged aromas of cassis and blackberry are a bit green and pyrazinic. Chunky, tannic and sticky in feel, this tastes of baked black fruits. Stewy, syrupy and creamy on the finish, the wine gets better the longer it sits."
US,90.0,32.0,Russian River Valley,Trione,"Made using techniques employed in crafting Pinot Noir, this wine has 5% Viognier blended in. It conveys a rustic sense of leather and black pepper, with waves of high-toned cherry, plum and brooding blueberry that combine in flavor. Its concentrated structure is lifted by a lilt of acidity on the finish."
US,85.0,12.0,Yakima Valley,Willow Crest,"Light and tart, this brings cranberry and pepper flavors, which lead into a swift, sharp, tannic finish."
US,93.0,44.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Loring Wine Company,"Complex aromas of honeysuckle, whipped butter, poached pear, baked white peach, sea salt and crushed rocks find their way into this rich, layered and yet zesty wine by Brian Loring. Ripe Gala apples meet with sea salt and slate on the palate that shows a lot of ocean influence. A slow sizzle of acidity presents more flavors of toast, vanilla and clove."
US,91.0,34.0,Willamette Valley,Aberrant Cellars,"Like its companion, Carpe Noctum, the Confero offers full flavors of cherry and berry, with spice and toast backing. Here the flavors are a touch lighter but perhaps more elegant and detailed, with suggestions of mint and caramel trickling through the finish."
US,84.0,25.0,Paso Robles,San Simeon,"Jammy, with flavors of white sugar, red and black cherries and buttered cinnamon toast. Drink with simple, sweet fare, like a hamburger with smothered onions, slathered in ketchup."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Soave,La Cappuccina,"Aromas of honeysuckle and orchard fruit lead the nose. The fruity palate doles out white peach, green apple and a hint of white almond alongside lively acidity. A mineral note signals the close."
US,92.0,80.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"What stands out about Confluence most is its wealth of plush mushroom and woodsy earth accenting the otherwise rich, ripe, black cherry flavor. Powerful, it offers Anderson Valley's nuances, a dash of spice and bright acidity."
France,87.0,16.0,Gaillac,Georges Vigouroux,"A blend of Syrah and Braucol from the slopes above Gaillac, this fruity, friendly wine has notes of spice and red berry. It's attractively juicy, with soft tannins, and it's ready to drink now."
Argentina,90.0,30.0,Mendoza,Ruca Malen,"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate. This has the ripeness and power that one would expect from a high-end Malbec, but also a bit more finesse and natural ?redness??than many heavyweights from Argentina. Hints of herbs, pine, lemon peel and mocha grace the structured finish."
France,89.0,25.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Magnol,"This is Barton & Guestier's home vineyard and, in 2006, it has produced a finely crafted wine. The balance is all there, with ripe red berry fruits and cranberry juice adding to the firm, dark core of tannins. It is worth aging  for two to three years but is certainly drinkable now."
US,90.0,30.0,Mendocino Ridge,Edmeades,"Made in the Edmeades style of high alcohol and exceptional ripeness, this is a powerfully explosive Zin. Fully dry, it's packed with black currant, cassis, plum jam, dark chocolate and spice flavors that are wrapped into hard tannins. Will soften in time. Best now through 2012."
US,90.0,36.0,El Dorado,Skinner,"This full-bodied and robustly concentrated wine has chocolate and cherry aromas, rich and ripe plum and blackberry flavors and layers of chocolate and vanilla on the palate and finish. It feels broad and juicy in texture, too."
US,83.0,20.0,North Fork of Long Island,Pellegrini Vineyards,"Rose oil and lychee aromas are pleasant on this off-dry GewÃ¼rztraminer, but whiffs of dust and oxidation distract. The palate boasts pretty potpourri notes brightened with fresh lemon acidity. Finishes warm with a soft alcoholic burn."
Italy,86.0,11.0,Prosecco del Veneto,Colli del Soligo,"This pristine Prosecco Brut offers drying mineral tones framed by delicate notes of stone fruit and spring blossoms. This is an elegant and linear wine with a direct and immediate personality. You'll get soft peach flavors and a clean, crisp close."
US,82.0,18.0,Mendocino,Barra of Mendocino,"This has sharp, tangy aromas, tart cranberry flavors, a lean texture and drying tannins that seem to coat the teeth. Difficult to enjoy on its own, it needs to pair with very rich, fatty food to tame the tannins."
US,90.0,50.0,Central Coast,Hearst Ranch,"This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable."
Spain,85.0,23.0,Cava,Llopart,"Light pink in color, this has chewing gum, watermelon and dust aromas. It is underwhelming on the palate, with a simple mouthfeel and flavors of cotton candy and cherry."
US,92.0,43.0,Red Mountain,Barrister,"Sourced entirely from old vine Tapteil fruit, this spent 32 months in French and American oak. It's loaded?as per usual with this winery?with generous, dark and smoky flavors of espresso, smoke and charcoal. But the fruit has the power and depth to handle it well, and as the wine breathes it smoothes out into a thoroughly luscious quaff."
US,92.0,75.0,Napa County-Sonoma County,Nobility,"Extra-ordinarily sweet, with fantastic honey, apricot, pineapple, orange marmalade, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Could be more complex, but dazzles for sheer decadence."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Prosecco,Bocelli,"This fresh simple sparkler opens with aromas of jasmine and a whiff of citrus. On the soft palate, tangy acidity lifts apple, white peach and a hint of glazed lemon peel."
France,88.0,20.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau GalÃ¨s,"Aged for a year in wood, this dense, structured wine has serious tannins that are still very firm. Hints of juicy red currant fruits underneath promise a fresh, fruity wine with time. Drink this wine from 2017."
US,92.0,18.0,El Dorado,Charles B. Mitchell,"This wine brings out the variety's richness and depth of fruit flavors, while keeping the texture smooth and pleasing. It's very firm with tannins and acidity, yet not overly full-bodied. The ripe blackberry and cassis flavors have the intensity to match the structure and make for great balance overall."
Australia,90.0,35.0,McLaren Vale,Mitolo,"The blend of 56% Grenache and 40% Shiraz also includes 4% Sagrantino, said to enhance structure. For its size, the wine is remarkably restrained, combining slightly resinous cherry fruit with hints of cinnamon, clove and mint. The finish is supple, suggesting early drinkability. Enjoy now??017."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Alto Adige,Nals Margreid,"Pinot Grigio Punggl opens with rich, creamy density and lovely aromas of peach, lemon zest and cantaloupe melon. That dense texture in the mouth is what sets this wine apart from the rest."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Friuli Isonzo,Blason,"Luminous and bright, this well-priced Pinot Grigio doles out fresh fruit flavors of peach, apricot and tangerine. The wine is lean and firm with an easygoing approach and spicy crispness on the finish."
Spain,88.0,25.0,Rioja,Marques de Arienzo,"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years."
US,93.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Merry Edwards,"From a vineyard site long tapped by both this producer and others, this beautifully crafted white is rich in a swirl of apple pie, fig and anise aromas and offers a voluptuous texture and mouthfeel. That concentration is complemented by crisp acidity, allowing for both balance and complexity."
France,85.0,30.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Carcanieux,"Heavy wood aromas are mitigated on the palate by the ripe fruit, making for a rich wine with black plum flavors as well as a core of tannins. It's going to develop well and quickly, so drink from 2016."
US,86.0,65.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Larner,"Alcohol and superripe fruit give this wine a Port-like taste, although it's totally dry. Bold tannins give it a tough astringency, and blackberry and currant flavors finish with hints of raisin and bitterness."
France,91.0,30.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Smith Haut Lafitte,"This is a ripe soft wine full of warm fruits and gentle tannins. The second wine of the always-impressive ChÃ¢teau Smith Haut Lafitte, it is a rich wine its own right. With black currant and dark plum flavors, it has some solid tannins from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2018."
US,90.0,25.0,California,Calista,"This is plush and tasty, with lots of fresh, ripe fruit flavors verging on sweet, but it also has great acidity and appetizing tannins to rein in all that flavor and achieve balance. The flavors resemble raspberry, ripe red cherry and a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's medium to full bodied, dry and finishes with a nice tartness."
France,91.0,95.0,Champagne,Taittinger,"A rich wine, this has a mineral as well as a fruity character. With a high proportion of Chardonnay in the blend, it is full of orange peel, apple and pink grapefruit flavors that are refreshing, with a crisp kick at the end. The wine is finely textured and tangy, with soft acidity as the aftertaste."
France,89.0,16.0,Alsace,Koenig,"Fresh pear notes and a touch of white blossom appear on the nose. The palate is rounded with fruit and a touch of flavor-boosting residual sweetness. This is easy but generous, full of ripe pear fruit."
US,91.0,32.0,Yakima Valley,Damsel,"This 100% varietal wine comes from a vineyard best known for its Syrah. It offers brooding aromas of mortared savory herbs, bittersweet chocolate and spice that lead to tart, well-balanced fruit flavors, backed by lightly dry tannins."
US,88.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Woodinville Wine Cellars,"Coming mostly from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this wine is co-fermented with 4% Viognier. Dark fruit and orange peel aromas mix with sweet barrel spices. The blue fruit flavors are sweet and lush, carrying some warmth along with them."
US,90.0,15.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"While the nose is restrained, the palate of this off-dry Riesling bursts with sweet, luscious pink grapefruit, guava and peach flavors. It's refreshingly crisp, yet deeply concentrated with a lingering, almost berried touch of sweetness on the finish. Drink now??016."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Mangiacane,"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019."
US,89.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"Here's a bowl full of fresh purple berries, plums and cherries. It's forward, fruity and just substantial enough, with supporting tannins, to age for another half decade or so. Drink now through 2020."
Australia,89.0,17.0,Langhorne Creek,Heartland,"Mixed berries, cracked pepper and baking spices mark the nose of this red, a blend of 52% Shiraz with 48% Cabernet. It's full bodied and supple on the palate, with spice notes accenting mulberry and cherry leading into a softly dusty finish tinged with cocoa. Drink now through 2020."
US,86.0,16.0,Clarksburg,Caricature,"Stylish oak aromas combine with rich fruit flavors in this full-bodied, velvet-textured wine. It smells like ripe black cherries, vanilla and caramel, with a fruit-forward palate. Made by the Lange Twins Winery."
Spain,89.0,26.0,Rioja,Finca Allende,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Bierzo,Peique,"Cutting aromas of rubbery red-berry fruits and wild herbs filter into a juicy, uncomplicated palate. Rubbery and medicinal tasting at first, this shows herbal raspberry and bitterness on the back end of the flavor profile and on the finish."
Italy,91.0,25.0,Lugana,Le Morette,"It opens with fragrances of stone fruit, Granny Smith apple and white almonds. The succulent palate delivers juicy pear, white peach, nutmeg, white almond and mineral alongside crisp acidity. It's nicely balanced with great length and finesse."
France,87.0,19.0,Bourgogne,Olivier Leflaive,"A blend from Puligny-Montrachet and Meursault, this is a soft rounded wine with white fruit acidity, almond flavors and a gentle lemon zest texture. Drink in the next two years."
France,89.0,22.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Wolfberger,"Faint hints of lemon meringue pie play on the nose. The palate is wonderfully light-footed and very slender. Crisp green-apple and citrus notes abound against the backdrop of biscuity notes of yeast. This dances on tiptoe and would make for an ideal, sprightly apÃ©ritif with all its crispness and its dry finish."
US,87.0,18.0,Sonoma County,Wild Thing,"Woody oak shows the 50% barrel fermentation behind this wine, sourced largely from the Dry Creek Valley. Baked apple and vanilla cream accent a thickly concentrated frame of big flavor and soft lush texture."
US,87.0,15.0,California,Spellbound,"Good price for a Cab of this elegance and complexity. It's a dry, full-bodied wine, with proper varietal flavors of black currants and cedar. A great substitute for a more expensive Cab in this economy."
US,88.0,27.0,Willamette Valley,Chehalem,"This smoky, dusty wine seems to be chugging quickly along the aging curve. At the moment, it's drinking nicely, decked out with pretty baking spice and mocha highlights. It's smooth and mouth filling, with lots of pretty cherry flavor."
France,93.0,47.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau du Tertre,"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish."
US,92.0,88.0,Napa Valley,Castello di Amorosa,"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025."
US,85.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Newlan,"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word ?fruit.??It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time."
France,87.0,10.0,MediterranÃ©e,Marrenon,"Yes, this is a rosÃ© of Merlot from high altitude vineyards in the south of France. It's medium in weight, offering hints of red berries, wild herbs and wet stones and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now."
US,94.0,39.0,Finger Lakes,Hermann J. Wiemer,"Fresh green herbs and lime zest lend vibrance to this lighter-bodied bottling from Wiemer's 2015 vintage. White grapefruit and citrus are piercing and spry, finishing with a delightful edge of salt and crushed-stone. Drinks beautifully now but should develop well through 2028."
France,88.0,29.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Bernard Magrez,"Ripe and luscious, this reflects the fruitiness of the vintage very well. It has tannins that will develop, although the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity dominate at the moment. Drink from 2018."
US,92.0,125.0,Central Coast,Turiya,"Angela Soleno has struck a bit of gold on her Petit Verdot-Sangiovese blends, in this bottling offering blueberry, cinnamon, star anise, leather, clove, maduro cigar and truffle notes. The palate shows cola, root beer, roasted fennel truffle salt and blackberry-balsamic reduction sauce, framed by sticky tannins that will hold these flavors for a few more years."
Italy,92.0,39.0,Vino Spumante,Dubl,"Lovely scents of ripe pear, white flower, Mediterranean herb, freshly baked bread and a hint of honey come together on this. The elegantly sparkling palate delivers white peach, green apple, lemon and nectarine zest. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a soft perlage adds elegance."
Italy,92.0,60.0,Taurasi,Donnachiara,"This Taurasi Riserva shows the beautiful and austere side of Aglianico, with penetrating notes of dried fruit, wet river stone, cigar box and crushed clove. It delivers structure and enough persistence to pair with stewed lamb and potatoes, and it can also be cellared for 10 years or more."
France,87.0,59.0,Champagne,A.R. LenobleÂ ,"With some attractive bottle age, this pale rosÃ© is warm and rich. Spice contrasts with crisp red fruits and acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
Italy,85.0,35.0,Chianti Classico,Coli,"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Colorino, this simple, fruity wine opens with discreet aromas of violet, red berries and black plum. The palate is rather lean, but you can detect black cherry and a hint of pepper. It finishes on a drying, tannic note."
US,86.0,24.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cloudlift Cellars,"This Bordeaux-style blend, one of four from this tiny winery, is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. The somewhat thin cranberry and raspberry fruit, high in acid, is not quite substantial enough to completely shed its candied character."
Australia,84.0,7.0,South Australia,Ballast Stone Estate Wines,"For the price, this is a commendable effort, with scents of toast and vanilla layered over modest cherry fruit. The wine is medium bodied and marked by the a fine, soft texture, then finishes on a tart note."
US,88.0,35.0,Applegate Valley,Troon,"All five Bordeaux grapes are in the blend, roughly 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot dominating the flavors. The vines average 30+ years. Tart purple fruits are set against spicy barrel flavors. The wine, still quite young, should continue to improve with bottle age. It's balanced and pleasant, though it pulls up a bit short."
US,90.0,45.0,Livermore Valley,Nottingham Cellars,"A blend of all five Bordeaux varieties (61% Cab Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 11% Petit Verdot, 7% Cab Franc and 7% Malbec), mostly from the Del Arroyo Vineyard, Supremacy is young winemaker Collin Cranor's showcase of what the right fruit and the right winemaking in Livermore Valley can do with the right vision. Juicy, full and fruity, the wine has considerable length and texture, great cherry-berry flavors, the whole package decently balanced."
US,88.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Summerland,"Widely accessible and hedonistic aromas of cherry pie with a tinge of wild mint lead the nose on this young but ready county blend. The palate is framed with oak influence and the associated tannins, as well as plum and ripe cherry fruit. It's unusual that this 2013 is on the market after 10 months in barrel."
US,89.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Volatus,"This is a whopper of a wine, thanks to the high alcohol and long aging, with aromas of caramelized blueberries, black-cherry syrup and concentrated lilacs. The palate is thick with fudge and blackberry-jam flavors, with a decent energy cutting through the brooding tar and pipesmoke character."
US,89.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Grgich Hills,"This is a classic Napa Valley floor Cabernet, enhanced with handfuls of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Dusty in red currant and herb, it offers mellowed tannins and a peppery underbelly."
France,87.0,25.0,Alsace,Emile Beyer,"Softly ripe notes of pear mingle with earthier elements on nose and palate of this dryish Riesling. The spine of acidity provides structure and fills the palate with lemony, bright freshness that lingers pleasantly."
Italy,86.0,24.0,Chianti Classico,Lornano,"This has aromas of toasted oak, espresso and spice that carry over to the palate along with dark fruit undertones. It's lean and linear without enough rich fruit to carry the assertive oak."
France,87.0,37.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Coutet,"This wine is soft and juicy, with attractive red berry fruit. Reflecting the vintage, it's a light with a dry core that will soften soon. The aftertaste is dry. Drink from 2018."
US,88.0,25.0,Virginia,Horton,"Northern Italian red grapes don't often turn up in Virginia. Electric pink in color, this saignÃ©e of Nebbiolo is all fruit. Fresh peach and strawberry mingle with juicy watermelon on a palate of ample weight and structure. While easy enough to be enjoyed on its own, this wine can pair with barbecue on a hot summer day."
Italy,93.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Capanne Ricci,"Textbook Brunello nose from a warm vintage. It grabs from a wide array of elements at its disposal, with balsam, cola and humus, backed by ripe fruit and dark cherry. More layers appear as leather, earth and cured meat. Great complexity and balance. Closes elegant, fresh and clean."
US,85.0,40.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Cimarone,"This Cabernet has a rather bubblegummy, candied, gassy taste. It's exuberantly ripe in cherries, red currants and mocha, and fun to drink, but expensive."
US,89.0,9.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine is immediate in its appeal with aromas of lime leaf, flowers and peach. It drinks off dry with a zing of acidity that beautifully frames the full-fruit flavors."
France,92.0,85.0,Volnay,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity."
Australia,88.0,20.0,Australia,Innocent Bystander,"This wine provides plenty of drinking pleasure for a moderate tariff. Smoke, toast and vanilla aromas speak to barrel fermentation and aging, while the apple, pear, pineapple and citrus flavors show off top-notch fruit. It's all put together in a balanced, medium-weight package that finishes clean and fresh."
US,87.0,12.0,Mendocino County,Cameron Hughes,"It's a fine wine, full-bodied and dry, with spicy flavors of currants, teriyaki beef, black pepper and cola, with a bracing minerality that grounds the richness. Could be more concentrated, but it's a great value."
US,87.0,16.0,Monterey,Carmel Road,"Nothing but fruit in this cleverly named, unoaked Chardonnay. The wine shows intense, long hangtime flavors of limes, oranges and exotic tropical fruits, heightened by crisp acidity and a strong minerality that accentuates and delineates the flavors."
US,91.0,40.0,Central Coast,Williams Selyem,"For drinking now, this red dessert wine satisfies for its soft, luxuriant texture, sweetness and depth of flavor. Offers blackberry jam, cherry marmalade, melted milk chocolate and smoky vanilla flavors accented with cinnamon, anise and pepper."
US,87.0,60.0,Sonoma Valley,Ravenswood,"Made in the style of an old field blend, this Zin is at least 75% varietal, but the balance could be anything among 14 other grapes. The wine is tannic, peppery and rich in currant and chocolate flavors, with high alcohol. Seems a pace or two behind more recent vintages."
US,90.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Seven Oxen,"Juicy aromas of blueberry meet with licorice and cola, but then show that pleasing gamy funk that this grape often provides. The palate is very likable and quaffable though not particularly complex, with cola, cherry juice, clove and caramel flavors."
US,87.0,28.0,Yorkville Highlands,Yorkville Cellars,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-like version of Petit Verdot, this has tame tannins and is all around soft and mellow, with straightforward berry and cedar notes. It would make a fine food wine."
US,90.0,25.0,McMinnville,Hyland,"Labeled 'Old Vine' now that the vineyard it's sourced from has passed 40 years of age, this dry, aromatic wine is varietally true without seeming cloying. Green banana, grapefruit and pineapple flavors feature prominently, along with a hint of lemon verbena."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,"Yellow stone fruit, pear and tropical fruit aromas lead the nose. On the zesty palate, bright acidity underscores yellow peach and honeydew melon flavors that linger into the crisp finish."
Italy,92.0,59.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,San Rustico,"This brawny red opens with aromas suggesting resin, stewed prune, blue flower, cooking spice and leather. The robust palate offers raisin, blackberry extract, cinnamon and mocha while solid, velvety tannins provide support."
US,92.0,20.0,California,Locations,"Lush and full in texture, this wine has more spicy flavors than fruity ones, as a blend of vanilla, hazelnut and cream coat the palate. It has the rich feel of barrel fermentation and will win friends with the layering of subtleties on such a decadent mouthfeel."
Spain,91.0,24.0,Rioja,Bodegas Franco-EspaÃ±olas,"Ripe, easy aromas of dried cherry, raisin and cedary spice are not unfamiliar for aged, traditional Rioja like this. The palate is fresh in feel, with a touch of oak resin impacting the mouthfeel. Common flavors of cherry, plum and spice finish with cocoa, dill, vanilla and tomato notes. This is a classic Gran Reserva to drink through 2024."
US,87.0,26.0,Dry Creek Valley,Gallo of Sonoma,"Oversized, with massive berry-cherry flavors that explode in the mouth. In fact, it's too big. The spicy fruity flavors are so powerful they dominate every other feature. That said, it's dry, and the tannins are soft and intricate. Match it with dramatic, boldly flavored dishes. ?S.H."
US,83.0,25.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Coyote Canyon,"The aromas start out quite reduced, providing significant distraction. The bell-pepper flavors are light and show a bit of age."
US,86.0,32.0,York Mountain,Calcareous,"Dry, soft and simple, with pleasant flavors of grilled cherries, raspberries, cola, red licorice, red currants and smoky oak. The texture is nice and silky. Drink now."
France,92.0,70.0,Chablis,ChÃ¢teau de Maligny,"Still very firm and closed, this is textured and rich, with intense mineral and wood flavors that balance the steeliness. It's full bodied, taut and nervy, with a concentrated core. Age for at least four years."
US,88.0,45.0,Carneros,Nickel & Nickel,"A pure, young Chardonnay made in a Chablis style, but you don't want to drink it now. Shows the acidic minerality of Carneros, with citrus, tropical fruit, wildflower and honey flavors. Too tight and unyielding. Give it until mid-2010 to mellow."
US,94.0,65.0,Spring Mountain District,Sherwin Family,"Opens with blockbuster notes of blueberry, cassis, licorice, smoke and earth, all the while displaying great depth. Finely integrated cherry, herb, espresso, oak and soy flavors have that intense vitality that command attention. Full and well proportioned on the palate, the wine finishes long, with beautiful fruit and big but very even tannins."
US,87.0,25.0,Lodi,Rock Wall,"Light strawberry, earth and rose-petal aromas add to the blackberry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It feels tight and tastes lean now, so it's best to drink after 2019."
France,89.0,35.0,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,"As a Gewurztraminer becomes sweeter, it loses some of its spice. What it gains, as here, is a more intense, honeyed and fragrant character that also allows space for acidity. There is some dryness on the finish, as well as a pleasant astringency. Drink until 2019."
Spain,92.0,40.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Intense, direct aromas of blackberry, cassis and graphite are bold but not overly complex. This is so large and extracted on the palate that the tannins grind. Ripe blackberry, cassis and a hint of salt fill the flavor profile, while this finishes fat, tannic and with flavors of licorice and blackberry. Drink through 2026."
Italy,85.0,20.0,Gavi di Gavi,Giacomo Ascheri,"A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish."
Argentina,84.0,20.0,Mendoza,Alma Negra,"This salmon-colored, no-dosage bubbly is peachy, dusty and yeasty on the nose, with strong whiffs of sulfur and scrambled egg. A clunky, foamy palate comes across as clumsy, while peach and melon flavors are a touch bitter and mealy. Papaya and savory barbecued notes drive the finish, which has a bitter element."
France,91.0,26.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Miraval,"This fruity rosÃ© is produced at the property owned by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie along with the Perrin family of ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape. It is lightly spicy and full of friendly, crisp red fruits. It can age for a few more months, so it could be enjoyed in 2018."
US,92.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Goat Bubbles,"Deep salmon in color, this pink sparkler from Norm Yost of Flying Goat offers nectarine, strawberry, mandarin zest and lees aromas on the nose. The palate is tangy, with hints of cranberry-orange juice and tangerine rind."
US,90.0,17.0,Edna Valley,Tolosa,"Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak."
France,90.0,18.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Recougne,"Spicy, ripe and fruity, this wine has enough structure to give shape to the broad black fruits that are the stars. A smoky element comes from just the right amount of wood aging. Drink from 2017."
Australia,94.0,100.0,Barossa Valley,Schild Estate,"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025."
France,89.0,28.0,Alsace,Domaine Gresser,"Creamy earthiness joins the yellow stone fruit on nose and palate, making for a toned-down but full-fruited, generously rounded Gewurztraminer. The structure provided by pithy, pleasantly bitter notes leaves a lasting, refreshing impact."
US,86.0,7.0,Yakima Valley,Tucker,"There are true, varietal scents of apricot, peach and honeysuckle. Fresh fruit in the mouth shows crisp, citrus and orange flavors, with some spritzyness on the tongue, and plenty of orange rind in the finish. This is fruity and dry enough to be well suited to spicy foods."
US,84.0,30.0,Sonoma Valley,Petroni,"Sweet and sugary in pineapple, lime and green apple flavors, this Chardonnay has a strong overlay of sweet oak. Everything is too much. It lacks subtlely and complexity."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Barbaresco,Colle dei Venti,"Cumin, Indian spice, asphalt, vanilla bean, dried fruit, black cherry and licorice characterize this aromatically multifaceted Barbaresco. The wine boasts dimension and personality and ends with dusty, smoky tannins."
Spain,84.0,15.0,Rioja,Federico Paternina,"This smells rubbery and gritty, with notes of gas and leather. It feels acidic and drawing but healthy, with earthy red-berry flavors. Dry and peppy, there's still not a lot of style or character to the wine."
Italy,89.0,39.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"Careful work has been done here to craft a creamy and smooth cool-climate Chardonnay with long aromatic staying power. You'll recognize fragrant tones of white rose, citrus blossom and almond flower."
France,87.0,12.0,Vin de France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"Drawing a blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah from several regions in southwest France, this soft and fruity wine is light with a juicy mix of acidity and dry tannins. Berry fruits and a fresh aftertaste suggest it is ready to drink now."
Argentina,83.0,7.0,Mendoza,Don Cristobal 1492,"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste."
US,87.0,28.0,Red Mountain,Michael Florentino,"This is a nice, drinkable red from Red Mountain, though it does not have any varietal focus. There's light red fruit, some sense of minerality, and balancing acidity."
US,91.0,25.0,Sonoma County,American Thread,"Fermented in stainless steel, this is a pretty wine, with a darker tint of pinkish-orange color. Tangy peach and lime provide a crisp, clear and light-bodied experience atop persistent acidity and texture."
France,95.0,300.0,EchÃ©zeaux,Domaine Jayer-Gilles,"Here is an ageworthy wine, a proper grand cru. The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate. But already, the fruit is impressively ripe and jammy, a fruit salad of black and red berry fruits. The tannins are dark, brooding away in the background. Keep this wine at least five years, probably 10."
US,88.0,30.0,Carneros,Truchard,"Rich and creamy, showing tangerine, apricot, buttered toast, cinnamon spice and herb flavors. A solid wine for drinking with roast salmon, seared tuna or a salad of bitter greens with goat cheese and orange slices."
France,90.0,45.0,Champagne,Beaumont des CrayÃ¨res,"A steely, mineral-driven Champagne, dry with signs of toasty bottle age. The wine is also crisp, layered with intense apples and citrus. The fruit and the more mature character are right in balance at this stage."
US,82.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,ChÃ¢teau Bianca,"Rather simple and plain, this Cellar Select trips across the palate like a ghost. Not much there in the way of fruit or flavor."
Spain,89.0,18.0,RÃ­as Baixas,GranbazÃ¡n,"Light fleshy aromas of peach and apricot lead to a tight juicy direct palate with pure, unadulterated flavors of pineapple, tangerine and apple. A crisp stony finish is fresh and in fine shape. This is a textbook racy AlbariÃ±o to drink right away."
Italy,91.0,55.0,Barolo,Marchesi di Barolo,"From the elegant and bright 2006 vintage, this shows aromas of spice, red fruit, leather, cola and cedar. The palate is attractive, showing tight, polished tannins and lively fruit."
Spain,91.0,85.0,Rioja,DinastÃ­a Vivanco,"Tight on the nose, with dense aromas of black fruit, leather, dried cheese and earth. It's also fairly smoky and lively, with textured tannins, a generous mouthfeel and complex flavors of berry, pepper and spice. A lively, forward style made from Tempranillo, Graciano, Garnacha and Mazuelo."
US,88.0,38.0,Dundee Hills,Winderlea,"This cuvÃ©e reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit."
US,88.0,50.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Clos La Chance,"Notes of cinnamon and peppercorns adds complexity to the cranberry-pomegranate fruit and slate minerality on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's more reserved in its palate, which offers cranberry tang with an herbal sagebrush quality, proving a reliable, straightforward take on the grape."
US,87.0,18.0,Paso Robles,EOS,"Rich cherry blossoms and dried strawberry-cherry paste aromas make for a very fruit-forward bottling. The palate is grippy with tannins that long hold attention, with dark red fruit and cinnamon flavors."
US,88.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Labeled dry, this nonetheless carries a hint of sweetness, at 70 g/L residual sugar.  It's fruity and fresh, with melon, citrus and peach prominent. A perfect summer sipping wine."
US,83.0,24.0,Dry Creek Valley,Dashe Cellars,"While it shows modest cherry pie filling flavors, it's simple and sweet, with a harshness from acidity and tannins."
US,83.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Pope Valley Winery,"This wine is made from 75% Sangiovese with 18.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6.5% Merlot. A little pruney, it falls flat and veers hot on the palate, full bodied and quite ripe. Dashes of cinnamon stick brighten the experience."
US,93.0,75.0,St. Helena,Raymond,"An ambitious Cabernet that's part of Raymond's program of highlighting individual appellations within Napa Valley. This wine is delicious, exhibiting rich, deep flavors of black currants with tasteful accents of oak. While it's fine to drink now, the tannins and long finish suggest up to eight years in the cellar will be beneficial."
US,90.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Dry Creek Vineyard,"This wine begins with intense oak and a voluptuous texture before settling into the crisp delicacy of bittersweet lemon and honeyed apple. Full bodied and nicely complex, it's a balanced expression of a cool vineyard site."
US,89.0,19.0,Oregon,Erath,"This is a fine budget bottle, with an aromatic mix of tart berry and pine needle. A streak of chocolate surrounds a supple, smooth wine that carries its tangy fruit through a satisfying finish, with just a suggestion of tanned leather."
US,94.0,35.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Coquelicot,"This wine is dry and crisp and enormously complex. It flatters the palate with waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, tangerines, bacon, white pepper and sweet vanilla oak, and the all-important tannin structure is fine. It's 94% Syrah, while 6% Viognier brings the perfect bite of acidity and citrus."
Italy,88.0,12.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Cesani,"Delicately scented, this has aromas of hawthorn, beeswax and a whiff of white stone fruit. The savory palate doles out white peach, yellow apple and bitter almond while a dollop of honey signals the close."
US,88.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Tandem,"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now."
US,92.0,20.0,Anderson Valley,Foursight,"Shows great acidity that really gets the tastebuds whistling, and also deep, complex varietal flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and sweet vanilla, with a green grass component in the background. Very fine and dry, an elegant, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc of great integrity."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Barbaresco,Rivetto,"Ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice, mint and menthol come together on this firm, full-bodied red. Tightly knit tannins give a solid grip to the finish."
US,85.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),For a Song,"Pure Cabernet is on display here, offering modestly interesting flavors for the price. It's leafy and light, with strawberry and herb. Tannins are herbal and balanced."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Orvieto Classico Superiore,La Carraia,"Poggio Calvelli opens with thick aromas of ripe fruit and apricot. However, the mouthfeel is thinner and less intense with an easy, but crisp fruity feel."
US,90.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Lucas & Lewellen,"Lighter in color than many 2012s from Santa Barbara County, this wine begins with an inviting nose that offers scents of strawberry-infused balsamic vinegar and sandalwood. Once sipped, it's light and crisp, but surprisingly powerful, with cranberry, pomegranate and a leather finish."
France,90.0,37.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Moya,"This is a ripe wine, already approaching maturity. It has rich tannins and a generous structure. The wine is full with plenty of black fruits and balanced acidity. Black currants and spices mingle easily. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
US,83.0,25.0,Rogue Valley,EdenVale,"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over."
France,84.0,12.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Pey de Faure,"Situated in the heart of the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers, this estate has a long history dating back to the Middle Ages. With its stalky black currant fruit and acidity, this is fruity with a cool edge and a crisp edge. Drink from 2018."
US,84.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,De Loach,"Hews to a sweeter style, at a time when the momentum for California rosÃ© is swinging toward dry. The wine has simple raspberry jam, orange zest, vanilla and white sugar flavors."
Italy,85.0,41.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Montresor,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition."
France,92.0,21.0,Vouvray,Domaine Pichot,"This single vineyard wine has enormous potential. At this stage it is dry and not quite integrated. But with the rich fruitiness, the hints of yellow fruits and the tight mineral character, this wine will age extremely well. Drink from 2021."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Terre Siciliane,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this easy-drinking wine opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, blue flower, graphite and whiffs of exotic spice. The round, juicy palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, ground black pepper and charred notes alongside light tannins and soft acidity. Drink through 2016."
US,90.0,22.0,Napa Valley,Silverado,"Medium-crisp, this wine delights in stone fruit and lime zest, with a taste of fuzzy apricot dominant on the palate. Showing a balance of body and weight, it wraps things up with a layer of acidity."
Italy,89.0,40.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Colombina,"This wine strikes a nice balance between sweet and savory spice on the nose, with ripe fruit, prune and leather in the background. This is a velvety, warm, earthy wine with a broad aromatic delivery and bold Brunello style. It's smooth and round, without any of the sharp acidic accents you sometimes find in Sangiovese Grosso."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Chianti,Fattoria Il Muro,"Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with subdued black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. It's built for early drinking and delivers ripe plum and cinnamon flavors with supple tannins."
Italy,91.0,35.0,Greco di Tufo,Di Meo,"This youthful ten-year-old demonstrates the impressive aging potential of well-made Greco di Tufo, opening with compelling dried stone fruit, Spanish broom, herb and smoky aromas. The round, smooth palate doles out creamy peach, mature Bartlett pear and lemon drop flavors. An energizing mineral note lingers on the finish. It's at its peak so drink now."
France,90.0,55.0,Mercurey,ChÃ¢teau de Santenay,"Ripe and juicy, this dense wine offers red-fruit flavors shot through with acidity. The old vines give depth to the rich wine that finishes with layers of bright fruit. Drink from 2018."
US,88.0,19.0,Paso Robles,Vinum,"Chocolate, elderberry, roast beef and purple flower notes emerge on the complex nose of this bottling. Richer blackberry and black currant flavors show on the palate, with touches of soy, char and sugar plum, proving quite savory all around."
Italy,87.0,24.0,Sicilia,Tenuta Gorghi Tondi,"A 70-30 blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay, this wine offers enormous freshness in the form of citrus blossom, white almond, honey, lemon mousse and basil leaf notes. It feels silky, crisp and light."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Venezia Giulia,Attems,"Attems' fresh Pinot Grigio would wash down nicely with fried fish or onion rings. There's a touch of sweet honey and peach in the mouth and the close is crisp, lean and sharp."
France,91.0,23.0,Alsace,Wunsch & Mann,"Earthy notes of forest floor and white field mushroom precede the fruitier notions of ripe fresh and dried pear on nose and palate. This wine has a balm-like quality to the texture and a depth of developed flavor. The dried apple finish is dry, lasting and clean."
US,86.0,100.0,Temecula Valley,Oak Mountain,"Elderberry and blueberry fruit meet with an interesting eucalyptus oil and spearmint component on the nose of this bottling. The minty charatcer shows strongly on the palate, with camphor tones decorating the black-plum fruit."
US,88.0,36.0,Livermore Valley,Page Mill Winery,"This has lots of jammy and peppery aromas and flavors, tastes dry, is very full-bodied, and feels rich but tight with tannins. Although bone dry and almost austere, it's honest and refreshing."
US,94.0,80.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"A tremendous wine, dry, rich and complex. Blended from Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec, it shows intricate notes of black currants, violets, dark chocolate, licorice and oak, wrapped into huge tannins. Drink 2019 and beyond."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Monterinaldi,"Composed of Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this offers aromas of blackberry, espresso, toast and a whiff of exotic spice. The palate offers black cherry extract, coconut, vanilla, toasted oak and licorice accompanied by fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017."
US,84.0,12.0,California,Weibel Family,"Apple and bread-dough aromas lead to apple-cider flavors, mouthfilling bubbles and a light touch of sweetness."
US,92.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Pellet Estate,"This small-production blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot from winemaker Tom Rinaldi is rounded and juicy, with moderate acidity. It shows generous clove, cinnamon and black cherry flavors, the structure supportive and graceful."
US,80.0,7.0,Monterey,Turning Leaf,The ?Reserve??on the label is hardly appropriate in this banal version of what is normally a racy varietal. This version shows a mild fruit in a somewhat stewed version.
Italy,87.0,15.0,Moscato d'Asti,Michele Chiarlo,"This precious Moscato d'Asti opens with soft foam and sweet aromas of peach, honey, almond blossom and jasmine. Pair this delicious dessert wine with fruit ice cream or semifreddo."
US,91.0,50.0,Dundee Hills,Argyle,"A very fine effort, this single-block sparkling wine captures a complex mix of grapefruit, lemon and lime. The fruit is balanced against precisely rendered bubbles, vivid acidity, with lightly toasty accents."
US,85.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Alysian,"Underripe, with green grass, gooseberry aromas and flavors. Acidity is high and mouthwatering, and there is a core of orange honey that will have its fans."
US,91.0,23.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton Estate,"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish."
US,93.0,75.0,Spring Mountain District,Barnett,"The winery's flagship Cabernet, this offers elements of cranberry and black cherry that slide onto the palate rather than explode. Fig and plum give it a savory edge, around accents of pencil lead, mocha and clove. Rich and soft on the tongue, the wine offers plenty to enjoy now, but it will also yield intrigue over several years, through 2029."
France,86.0,15.0,Coteaux du VendÃ´mois,Cave Cooperative du VendÃ´mois,"This is a crisply structured wine, with attractive yellow fruits, a touch of honey and pineapple acidity. It's delicious, perfumed and fresh, and ready to drink now."
Argentina,90.0,23.0,Cafayate,Michel Torino,"This single-vineyard wine is always dense and powerful. This edition opens with prune, blackberry, Graham cracker and earthy aromas. In the mouth, it's pinched, with rubbery tannins. Salty, roasted flavors are true to the Salta region, while the finish is black in flavor and bulky in feel."
Spain,86.0,25.0,Navarra,PrÃ­ncipe de Viana,"Jammy, mildly green aromas of tobacco, cherry and blueberry shed clarity with airing. This blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot is high in acid, a touch abrasive and hollow in the midpalate, with green-leaning, minty flavors of blackberry and plum. This finishes acidic, with some scour."
US,88.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,J. Wright,"A blend of Pommard and Wadenswill clones, this was aged in large, neutral puncheons. It's smooth, light and well balanced, showing fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. The vintage was challenging, and flavors of leaf and herb are also in the mix."
US,85.0,25.0,Arroyo Seco,Nomadica,"This art-forward, canned-wine project hits a bit of a freshness wall here. The wine is quite light in the glass yet full of dried and tired red-cherry-syrup aromas and an odd cola spice. The palate is somewhat viscous without being sweet, showing concentrated red-cherry flavors and clove spice."
US,91.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance."
France,91.0,85.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau SÃ©gur de Cabanac,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, packed with tannins and flavors of new wood. The black fruits are rich from the vintage, warm and jammy. This is a wine with fine concentration, coming into balance, finishing with black currant acidity."
US,82.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Whispering Tree,Volatile aromas provide significant distraction. The black- and blue-fruit flavors are easy drinking but can't provide enough counterbalance.
France,93.0,90.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Louis Latour,"Rich and rounded with a creamy texture, this wine is ripe with apricots and has a strongly mineral character. Full of fruit, the wine also has a texture that means it needs to age. Drink from 2021."
France,89.0,21.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Jean-Luc Colombo,"The voluble, opinionated Jean-Luc Colombo has crafted a Cairanne that shows a lot of ripe Grenache character, offering scents akin to cherries, almond butter and almost peach or apricot. It's on the chunky side, with some dusty tannins on the finish, so you could drink it now or save it for a few years."
US,89.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Daviana,"This 100% Cabernet is so approachable now. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, cherries, cassis and mocha, touched with oak and wrapped in firm tannins. The grapes were grown in the new Coombsville appellation of the valley."
US,91.0,75.0,Rutherford,Pine & Brown,"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb?the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting."
Italy,94.0,80.0,Barolo,Cordero di Montezemolo,"This concentrated Barolo opens with aromas of violet, plum, subtle oak and menthol. The dense palate delivers crushed black cherry and raspberry layered with milk chocolate, coffee, clove and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and bracing tannins. Drink 2018??038."
US,86.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Andrew Will,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm."
France,89.0,80.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont,"This is a structured wine, firmly tannic and with considerable wood flavors at this stage. Plenty of rich fruit lies in the background, giving promise for the future. With those red berry flavors and fine acidity in place, this will be a solid, dense wine. Drink from 2018."
Argentina,89.0,19.0,La Consulta,Altocedro,"Oaky aromas of pencil eraser and milk chocolate are draped over cherry and red-plum notes. This feels chunky and a bit heavy and creamy, with chocolaty oak dominating the flavor profile along with medicinal berry notes. An herbal tasting choppy finish is saturated."
US,90.0,18.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Lookout Point,"An excellent follow up to the winery's 2008 Malbec, this well-made wine includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot?all from the Two Coyote Vineyard. Cherries and plums are lightly dusted with an accent of cocoa from having spent 21 months in 30% new oak. The finish is clean as a whistle."
France,87.0,18.0,Touraine,Domaine JoÃ«l Delaunay,"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Gamay concentrates on fruit and soft acidity. It has some smokiness and rounded tannins, fresh and full of red fruits. It is ready to drink."
US,88.0,35.0,Napa Valley,V. Sattui,"Made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir, with detectable residual sugar, this wine is moderately complex in its mix of peach, cherry and citrus flavor. The acidity is simple and direct. The palate is thick and creamy."
Italy,95.0,130.0,Barolo,Vietti,"Rocche Barolo is another homerun for Vietti. You'll fall in love with the wine's rich intensity and the ensuing complexity that becomes apparent as the wine spends more time in the glass. Thanks to a continuing evolution, you'll recognize aromas of wild berry, smoke, crushed stone, licorice, cola and mesquite. The tannins are silky and smooth. Hold ten years or more."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Barbera d'Alba,Pecchenino,"This earthy and spicy Barbera possesses an intense fragrance of black cherry, plum, clove and herb. The palate shows ripe black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and hints of well integrated oak and roasted coffee beans."
US,93.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"From a cool site in the Sebastopol Hills greatly influenced by the cooling fog and winds of the Petaluma Gap, this wine is velvety in texture, with a gritty tannic backbone. Cedar, eucalyptus and savory tea complement an array of juicy red fruit and blueberry, with structure and balance at the wine's core."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Collio,Colmello di Grotta,"This opens with aromas of sunbaked earth, warm hay and crushed stone. The ripe round palate shows mature golden apple, ripe Bartlett pear and a hint of saline while a note of white almond marks the close."
Italy,92.0,42.0,Gattinara,Travaglini,"Aromas of raspberry compote, vanilla, clove and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this structured red. The firm yet elegant palate shows dark cherry, cranberry, licorice, chopped herb and mineral. Fresh acidity and polished fine-grained tannins lend balance and finesse. Drink 2018??027."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Vino Spumante,Dorigo,"Austere and refined, this elegant sparkler opens with aromas of toasted bread crust, walnut and a hint of oak. Made entirely with Pinot Noir, the linear palate delivers yellow apple, lemon zest and a touch of exotic fruit alongside bright acidity and an elegant perlage."
Italy,93.0,85.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Villa Poggio Salvi,"Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018??024."
US,93.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Lost Canyon,"This bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness. Packed with dry berry, cherry, leather, mocha and toasty oak flavors, it's beautiful now, with decanting, and should hold and even improve for up to six years."
US,90.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Longoria,"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, along with brisk acidity. Beneath the buttered toast and butterscotch are intensely concentrated tropical fruit flavors. The wine is a little linear now, possibly because the vines are quite young. Give it 2?? years in the cellar."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Chianti Classico,Fattoria Montecchio,"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, iris and a whiff of new leather. The zesty palate shows black cherry and a hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins that leave a sharp finish."
France,88.0,15.0,Collines RhÃ´daniennes,Cave de Tain,"Despite being less expensive, this is more expressive and fruitier than the Crozes-Hermitage. Pineapple, melon and hints of stone fruit and mango are reasonably full and rich for a wine that's labeled at a moderate alcohol level. Drink now."
US,91.0,25.0,Lodi,Mettler Family Vineyards,"For a wine from a sometimes rough-edged variety, this is especially smooth, sculpted and drinkable. That's not to deny that it's intense in color, full bodied and firm textured. But the tannins feel polished so the texture is smooth, letting ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors come out."
Argentina,84.0,17.0,Mendoza,Finca WÃ¶lffer,"Prickly aromas of nettle and cactus include crushed vitamin scents and tropical fruit notes. This feels gritty and dilute. Tart tropical-fruit flavors of lychee, pineapple and lime finish crisp, tangy and angular."
France,88.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine Dubost,"There are some fine, dry tannins in this wine along the dark cherry fruit and acidity. It comes from a single vineyard part of the 61-acre estate of Jean-Paul Dubost. There is a ripe feeling here; drink this balanced wine now."
US,88.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Rooster Hill,Pleasant whiffs of smoked nut and blossom accent fresh apple and pear in this squarely balanced dry white. Fresh acidity on the midpalate lends zip to a lingering but refreshing finish. Drink now through 2020.
Spain,84.0,10.0,Cava,Jaume Serra,"Citrus and yeast aromas form the nose on this wine, which feels forward and bubbly, with some sizzle to the palate. Cherry, plum and nectarine flavors are good, and it finishes with vitality. This is sweet and flavorful stuff."
France,84.0,43.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Georges Duboeuf,"Smooth and generous, this wine is soft and missing any bite. It is round and unfocused, but ready to drink now."
US,86.0,17.0,Sonoma Coast,Michael Pozzan,"This isn't the most powerful, impressive Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast, but it has a lot going for it. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and elegant on the palate, with a flavor of sour cherry candy that's savory and clean. Drink now."
US,84.0,13.0,Paso Robles,Vina Robles,"As soon as you unscrew the top on this 100% Syrah blush wine, the aromas of raspberries and strawberries release into the air, like incense. Those fruits follow through in the taste, turning jammy, heavy and sweet. The alcohol is a heady 14.9% by volume."
Italy,91.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenute Silvio Nardi,"Black licorice, cola and cherry liqueur open the nose and segue to black currant and crÃ¨me de cassis aromas, then forest floor, bramble and Spanish cedar. This wine is linear, crisp and tight on the palate, with firm tannins. Give the wine five more years to soften."
US,88.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"Aromatic with pepper and fresh-cut tobacco, well defined by herbal fruits and leafy tannins, this single-vineyard Malbec is stylish and balanced. What is missing is depth, but the balance and length are just right, and the wine does not overreach."
US,90.0,32.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Waxwing,"Scott Sisemore's small Belmont-based label pushes the lower-alcohol movement into the realm of Syrah, in this case producing a wine whose aromas are more like one of the appellation's Cabs, with juniper, pine, oregano, green and black olives and dried plums. Elderberries and those same herbal characters show on the palate, which some will love and others will find unfamiliar."
Italy,89.0,50.0,Barolo,Olivero,"Dark berry, tilled earth and gamey aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers black cherry, chocolate, peppermint and oak alongside tightly packed tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018."
Italy,90.0,21.0,Lambrusco di Sorbara,Paltrinieri,"Invigorating and frothy, this opens with aromas of woodland berries and violets. The savory palate offers mouthfuls of wild cherry, strawberry and clove alongside bright acidity and small, persistent bubbles. Chill this down for a crisp and refreshing summer red."
Australia,89.0,65.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"The Ironstone Pressings features enough rough edges at this stage to think it will benefit from a few years of cellaring. The tart cherry notes are angular, the tannins a bit chunky, but tea leaf and spice notes provide ample complexity. Try in 2013."
Argentina,89.0,40.0,Uco Valley,Zuccardi,"Initial rubbery, the oaky and smoky aromas give way to blueberry and plum scents. Hard tannins are cut by juicy acidity, while this tastes of blackberry, dark plum and bacon. Persistent hard-driving tannins are abrasive on the finish, which holds onto racy acidity and core berry fruit flavors."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Kenwood,"It starts out with a pretty ruby-garnet color with hints of youthful purple, and also has youthful, vibrant aromas of freshly crushed black cherry, blackberry, clove and a distinct black-pepper note. In the mouth, it?s lively, soft and supple. The fruit is intense and so is the spice, and it?s very dry. Good stuff, although it lacks a certain depth."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Toro,Toriles,"Bold berry aromas charge forth in a clean, pointed fashion. This feels firm and solid, with no obvious flaws and a dark flavor of blackberry that's offset by notes of rooty licorice and sweet brown sugar. Lengthy and fresh on the finish."
France,85.0,14.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Fleur de Charme,"A ripe and smooth wine, this has balanced tannins, bright red fruit and acidity. It is fruity, rounded and with a fresh aftertaste. An easy wine, it is ready now."
Spain,85.0,11.0,CariÃ±ena,Pago AylÃ©s,"Leathery, horsey lead aromas include hints of licorice, baked plum and green herbs. This Garnacha has a saucy, tomatoey feel and leafy red-berry flavors that finish with a hint of sweet caramel and herbal overtones."
US,90.0,34.0,Red Mountain,Efeste,"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Red Mountain Syrah remains a bit tight and tannic, with hints of green tea in the finish. The fruit is tart and compact, with a nose of blueberry and brown sugar. Tannins are quite hard and slightly bitter; this will require some further cellaring."
Argentina,83.0,16.0,Argentina,AguijÃ³n De Abeja,"Soft herbal berry aromas are minty and green. The palate on this young but raisiny Cabernet has a jammy cushion to it, while flavors of green bean, herbs and carob are not distinguished. A creamy feeling but tannic finish is chewy, chunky and weighty."
US,91.0,36.0,Sonoma Coast,The Withers Winery,"A light imprint marks this high-toned wine, expressive in crisp green apple, citrus and stone. Fresh in lemony acidity, it builds up to a medium body in the glass, offering impressive complexity and refreshment."
US,91.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Guardian,"A blend of Klipsun and Obelisco vineyards, this Cabernet Sauvignon leads with aromas of blackberry jam, espresso, fresh herbs and toasty barrel spices (60% new French). The black fruit flavors are rich, ripe and sweet, with the oak playing a prominent part in the show."
Spain,88.0,18.0,Rioja,CVNE,"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010."
US,90.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Drew,"Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids. If you buy it, do what the winery should have: store it for at least an additional year, and better yet, three."
France,90.0,18.0,Cahors,Clos Troteligotte,"A big, bold wine that is full of dense fruit and sweet berry flavors. It has weight and richness, the structure stuffed with pure, ripe Malbec fruit that has not been in wood. Delicious and worth aging 2?? years."
Argentina,94.0,95.0,Perdriel,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Among Cobos's high-end 2011 Malbecs, this one comes across as the most complete, layered and complex of the group. Aromas of fine oak and pencil lead augment blackberry and baked plum scents. The mouthfeel is smooth, round and rich, while flavors of tea, savory spices and black fruits dance long into the night. A ripe but not too heavy finish is earthy, calm and complete. Drink through 2019."
Italy,92.0,130.0,Barolo,Poderi Aldo Conterno,"Robust and forward, this opens with aromas of dried rose petal, truffle, forest floor, baked fruit and sweet cake spice. The warm palate doles out notes of high-toned cherry, cinnamon, clove and anisette alongside big, velvety tannins. Hold for a few years and then enjoy. Drink 2017??023."
US,86.0,48.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"This bottling from fine winery Foxen has varied over the vintages, sometimes quite good, sometimes ordinary. The '11 is somewhere in the middle. It's a bit thin, with the blackberry, coffee and currant flavors disappearing quickly on the finish. It's also oddly acidic, whether naturally so or added. Either way, it's not an ager."
US,90.0,60.0,Oregon,King Estate,"The wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate."
Spain,89.0,75.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Pazo de SeÃ±orans,"Aromas of wheat and straw are leesy and show little fruit. Seeing that this is from 2007, the fruit hit the road years ago; what's left is acidity, leesy hints, stone-fruit notes and peach-pit bitterness. With the right food and on the right occasion, this will work well. Otherwise, it's a novelty. Drink through 2018."
US,86.0,14.0,North Coast,Parducci,Aromas and flavors of black cherries and pomegranate juice fill this medium-bodied and sturdy-textured wine. A generous helping of tannin gives it a firm mouthfeel and more than stands up to the generous fruit flavors. Drink now through 2020.
France,86.0,16.0,Gaillac,Domaine Rotier,"A barnyard aroma and ripe black fruit are the hallmarks of this young wine. Bottled without sulfur, it's packed with blackberry flavors and soft tannins. It's all fruit and spice, with only light tannins. Drink now."
France,92.0,80.0,Pommard,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"A blend of wines from different Premier Cru vineyards, this is firm, as befits a Pommard, but has such great ripe fruit that it feels almost opulent. Lovely rich raspberry fruits are touched wit red currants and supported by solid tannins  at the end. Drink from 2017."
US,86.0,30.0,Dry Creek Valley,Del Carlo Winery,"From the grape-growing family known for old-vine Zinfandel, this wine comes from the eastern foothills of the appellation, the vines settled into well-draining, rocky soils. Floral on the nose, it enters into a gaminess on the palate, dusted in pencil lead, blackberry and herb."
Italy,92.0,39.0,Cortona,La Braccesca,"This is opulent and rich, with a thick, velvety texture and pretty aromas of blackberry, chocolate, leather and freshly milled white pepper. Cortona is the wine area of Italy that's most closely associated with this grape."
US,92.0,44.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Foxen,"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine."
France,91.0,30.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau Cantenac Brown,"A hugely concentrated wine showing chewy, but ripe tannins. Smooth, polished fruit combines with well-balanced wood and suppressed power. This is certainly a wine that will develop well, making it drinkable in five years and mature in 10-15 years."
France,92.0,72.0,Beaune,Albert Morot,"This firm, dark and still young wine has intense acidity that comes from the red currant and raspberry fruit. The tannins though form the real basis of this concentrated wine. Great juicy fruits at the end will develop well. Drink from 2018."
US,82.0,7.0,California,Barefoot,"Sweet and simple, with jammy raspberry and bubblegum flavors."
Italy,91.0,150.0,Barolo,Vietti,"Still rather closed, this eventually reveals red berry, menthol espresso and culinary-spice aromas. The tightly wound palate offers sour cherry, sage, white pepper and star anise alongside a backbone of firm close-grained tannins that grip the finish."
Australia,86.0,20.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"Crisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020."
France,88.0,22.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Wolfberger,"Attractive, best-selling CrÃ©mant d'Alsace, with its crisp apple and almond flavors to go with the acidity. It is lively, well-balanced, a great value in sparkling wines."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,Black Cabra,"An edgy nose with cassis, plum and cherry aromas is upright and fresh. This is lively and a bit jagged in feel, with cassis, cherry and chocolaty oak flavors. A firm finish with rubbery grabby tannins closes this out."
France,87.0,22.0,MÃ©doc,Cheval Quancard,"Pushing forward the acidity of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured and freshly fruity wine, full of black currant flavors as well as red berry fruits. There is a dry core here from wood aging. The fruit gives a delicious buoyancy to the aftertaste."
US,87.0,30.0,Los Carneros,Martin Ray,"On the plus sde, this Pinot is dry and lightly silky, and shows spicy cherry, rosehip tea, cola and sandalwood flavors. It's not the most complicated wine ever, but a nice, clean wine to drink now."
France,84.0,20.0,Bourgogne,Domaine Jessiaume,"An easy, fruity wine, its attractive red cherry flavors bubbling away in soft tannins and light acidity. Very drinkable, and not for aging."
US,86.0,135.0,St. Helena,Knights Bridge,"This Cabernet is a mixed bag. It's oaky and also fruity, but a little vegetal, with some green notes alongside sweet raspberry and cherry candy and caramel flavors. A real disappointment, coming after a series of good bottlings, but the vintage was difficult."
Argentina,86.0,18.0,Mendoza,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Toasty, oaky and a bit lemony on the nose, this has baked apple notes that are friendly. It feels round and honeyed, with toasty, candied flavors that veer toward pear, apple and honey. Resin and cinnamon flavors work the soft, sweet-tasting finish."
France,84.0,10.0,Cahors,Meyblum et Fils,"This is a simple, red-fruit-flavored wine. It has soft tannins, a bright texture and fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
Italy,93.0,40.0,Alto Adige,Tiefenbrunner,"Showing extreme elegance, this fragrant, radiant wine opens with aromas of jasmine, white peach and aromatic herb. The linear palate delivers crisp Granny Smith apple, white stone fruit, sage, lemon drop and flinty mineral alongside zesty acidity that provides balance and energy."
US,90.0,35.0,Ribbon Ridge,Omero,"This cuvÃ©e gets some extra time in 40% new wood, and is bottled unfiltered. Plush blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors, accented with streaks of cola and chocolate, capture your attention. It's a rich tasty forward immediately enjoyable bottle, so go for it now through 2020."
Italy,86.0,40.0,Toscana,Colle Spinello,"This opens with aromas of wet leaves, forest floor, menthol and prune. Made from Alicante and a drop of Montepulciano, the palate delivers mocha, crushed herb, licorice and a fig note alongside evolved tannins. It's already tired, so drink soon."
Argentina,91.0,24.0,Mendoza,Sottano,"Chocolate and charcoal aromas form a dark and masculine greeting. There's also coffee and an herbal note to the nose. Lush but not heavy, tannic or plodding, with powerful black fruit and herbal flavors. Runs deep and long on the finish; impressive."
US,87.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Glenora,"Fragrant white florals and concentrated flavors of juicy pink pomelo are effortlessly decadent on this semidry Riesling. While soft and supple on entry, there's a nervy edge of Meyer lemon pith accentuated by a long, mineral-laced finish."
France,91.0,35.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Cantelys,"Owned by the Cathiard family of ChÃ¢teau Smith Haut-Lafitte since 1994, the vineyard of Cantelys neighbors both Smith Haut-Lafitte and the Lurton-owned Rochemorin. The wine is rich, smooth, the wood well integrated, allowing fine wafts of herbaceous citrus and currant flavors to come out of the glass. It's ready to drink now, but could age over 2?? years."
US,92.0,45.0,Red Mountain,Januik,"Coming from Red Mountain's most esteemed vineyard, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coffee bean and dark cherry. The coffee and cherry flavors show exquisite polish and depth, with fruit and barrel flavors playing off each other on the finish."
US,92.0,30.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foley,"Sea salt, honeysuckle, lemon-sprayed apple and a touch of graphite dominate the nose of this tasty wine that grows only more interesting with time. Lime zest plays on the edges of the palate, though the middle shows a nectarine and yellow-pear richness. Energetic acidity tickles the tongue throughout the sip."
US,88.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Wrights Station,"Bruised apricot, lemonade and citrus rind-laden marzipan notes hit the nose on this wine, which is showing just a touch of nutty, honeyed oxidization. The macadamia nut element arises on the palate too, alongside intriguingly peaty flavors reminiscent of Scotch, with almond liqueur on the outro. It presents decent acidity throughout."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Maremma Toscana,Tenuta La Badiola,"Glossy and bright in appearance, this Vermentino is backed by notes of stone fruit, honey and dried herb. On the palate, it feels crisp, streamlined and zesty."
US,92.0,56.0,Russian River Valley,Matrix,"Deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic dusty spices, this Pinot Noir has a tannin-acid tightness that makes it aloof and hard. Although it's dry, it's so rich in fruit, it tastes sweet. A very fine wine, but needs some time to come around. Give it four or five years to mellow."
Italy,91.0,17.0,Lugana,Marangona,"Enticing wildflower, chopped herb and ripe orchard fruit scents abound in this radiant wine. The palate doles out white peach, yellow pear and nectarine notes, with stony mineral accents. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Fetzer,This light to medium-bodied wine follows initially earthy and metallic aromas with decent plum flavors. The aroma clears up with time and the wine's soft texture and fruitiness peek through.
US,89.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Tertulia,"There's no mistaking the variety, with the hallmark aromas of jalapeÃ±o pepper, cayenne and herbs. The ample cherry flavors are sweet, with the tannins bringing some graininess."
France,86.0,16.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Pardon et Fils,"This is a firm and structured wine that is not yet ready to drink. With surprising tannins and a tight texture, it needs time for the fruit to come through. Drink starting from 2017."
France,85.0,10.0,Vin de France,Kiwi CuvÃ©e,"This lush wine leads with rich aromas of vanilla-infused blackberry, raspberry preserves and plum sauce. The medium-weight palate is plush and velvety in texture, with supple blackberry and plum flavors that carry through to the medium-length finish."
US,90.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Moone-Tsai,"Made using grapes grown high in the Mayacamas Mountains, this is extremely concentrated in pineapple essence, peach custard and tropical fruit flavors. It's extravagant, with 50% new French oak playing a strong role in contributing notes of buttered toast, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and butterscotch to the flavor profile."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Puglia,Tenuta Fujanera,"Spicy and raw, this features tight berry aromas, followed by licorice and rum cake accents. A blast of heat and ripe fruit appears on the finish."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Alto Adige,Kettmeir,Delicate aromas of orchard fruit and white spring flower mingle together while the reserved but refined palate offers green apple and mineral. Crisp acidity and a hint of mineral give it a clean finish.
France,88.0,9.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"In a modern, smooth style, with plush fruit and dusty tannins, this is a ripe, open wine, an easy expression of Malbec, New World in its fruitiness."
Australia,84.0,15.0,Barossa,Peter Lehmann,"Shows good varietal character in its herb- and tobacco-accented cassis aromas and flavors, but lacks the intensity to put it in the top class. A well-priced Cabernet for near-term consumption or restaurant wine lists."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Trentino,La Vis,"Fresh and fruity, this lively white offers aromas and flavors of green Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and white peach. Zesty acidity gives it a crisp, tangy finish."
US,90.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pondera,"This wine shows a classic Washington Malbec profile of green, stemmy herbs, citrus, black pepper and plum along with light barrel accents. It's soft in feel, palate-staining with plum flavors, tart acids and lightly gritty tannins, disclosing blood-orange flavors on the finish."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Chianti Classico,Casaloste,"Made entirely from Sangiovese and aged in French oak, this wine opens with aromas of oak, coffee, black fruit and spice. The dense palate delivers delicious black cherry along with sweet vanilla, oak extract and espresso alongside drying wood tannins."
US,91.0,42.0,Ballard Canyon,Comartin,"Ripe raspberries, plump alpine strawberries and cranberry-cola notes meet with shaved cinnamon, pencil lead and dried sage on the nose of this single vineyard expression. The flavors are focused on woody red fruits, with chaparral scrub highlights as well as bay leaf and juniper. It's relatively light but well layered."
US,86.0,14.0,California,Bootstrap,"This is a pleasant, rather light-tasting wine with attractive, fresh raspberry aromas, red cherry flavors and good acidity to balance out the ripe fruitiness."
Italy,92.0,36.0,Toscana,Fuligni,"This modern red from the Montalcino area of Tuscany exhibits amazing chocolate-like intensity with dark shades of espresso bean, black cherry, vanilla, incense and strawberry cola. It has so much cherry in the mouth it recalls cherry liqueur or cherry-chocolate cake."
US,91.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Les Belles Collines,"Initially intense in caramel and salty toffee, this wine offers a vibrant strip of acidity that provides backbone and levity to the body and oak. Floral and fruity in yuzu, it presents itself in a big style, but ultimately finishes with balance."
US,82.0,28.0,Virginia,Narmada,"This has a dark-smelling nose that's a commingling of char, licorice and bitter chocolate scents. Espresso-like in its bitterness and pungency, the palate feels ultraslender, lacking vital extract."
France,91.0,40.0,Santenay,David Moreau,"This wine is perfumed, with delicious notes of plum and spice that are balanced by light tannins and fine, elegant acids. A touch of mineral marks the finish."
US,88.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"Soft, layered and approachable, this dances in dried herb and black and red currant that provide a vibrancy on the palate that's refreshing for a wine so young. A touch of violet comes to the fore on the finish."
Italy,93.0,120.0,Costa Toscana,Duemani,"Firmly structured, this opens with aromas of cedar, dried herbs, black currant and sweet pipe tobacco. The smooth, rich palate delivers mature wild cherry, blackberry, dark chocolate, ground black pepper and a graphite note alongside a backbone of velvety tannins."
Spain,87.0,11.0,Valencia,Tussock Jumper,"Textbook aromas of lychee and quince jelly open this spritzy Asti-styled Moscato. Despite its bubble content, this is smooth and easy in the mouth. Creamy, sugary flavors of lime, lychee and melon finish easy. This should appeal to Moscato fans."
Spain,84.0,40.0,Rioja,Marques de Tomares,"Baked, saucy aromas suggest the wine's overall character. It's ripe and stewy, with a grippy palate and a flavor profile full of tomato, herbs and red plum. Tastes herbal and roasted on the finish; aggressive, savory Rioja."
US,90.0,27.0,Sonoma County,Greenwood Ridge,"Zinfandel is not usually a wine you have to age, but this one does need four years or so in the cellar. It's bone dry and quite good, with classic wild berry, tobacco, grilled meat and spice flavors, but it's pretty tannic. Has the depth and balance to blossom by, say, 2015."
Italy,89.0,21.0,Falerno del Massico,Villa Matilde,"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes."
France,90.0,37.0,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,"Aromatically ripe notes of peach and mandarin soar. The palate of this wine is equally generously fruited, with a vein of ripe lemon acidity at its fresh core. Juicy and very refreshing, it finishes dry and totally moreish with pink grapefruit."
US,88.0,26.0,Temecula Valley,Robert Renzoni,"This is a fruity, tropical rendition of grape, showing guava, papaya, coconut and apple aromas on the nose. The palate packs loads of floral character, with more tropical fruit and bubblegum-like flavors that feel ripe but not sweet."
US,88.0,14.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"Mild apricot, mineral and almond flavors combine for a quiet and dry approach. It is full bodied, rather rich in texture, but well balanced by acidity. A subtle toasted-nut nuance lingers on the finish."
Argentina,85.0,12.0,San Juan,Tussock Jumper,"Raspberry and plum aromas set a forceful tone for this tannic, pinchy Malbec. Flavors of plum and mixed berries are generic, while this finishes grapy, tannic and with a note of clove."
Argentina,88.0,12.0,Mendoza,Sur de los Andes,"Exotic on the nose, with aromas of raspberry, plum and blueberry. Shows good intensity on the palate, with a solid feel and fresh flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Fresh but smooth on the finish; very good in every way."
US,93.0,50.0,California,Sanguis,"A RhÃ´ne-style wine, mostly Roussanne, co-fermented with Viognier. Defining richness, it's elaborate and heady in orange, honey, apricot, sandalwood, anise, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. This full-bodied beauty is a white wine for red wine fans. Don't chill it too much."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Chianti,Tenuta La Gigliola,"Black cherry, plum and mint aromas lead the nose and carry over to the juicy palate. It's round, smooth and accessible thanks to soft tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy soon."
US,92.0,55.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Dominio IV,This lovely effort shows both finesse and generous ripe fruit. A soft smudge of mocha?or maybe halvah?lingers gracefully through a lengthy finish. The complexity and supple integration of fruit and barrel mark this as the best of an excellent lineup from Dominio IV.
Italy,88.0,18.0,Alto Adige,Erste Neue,"This is a gorgeous Sauvignon from northern Italy that demonstrates true varietal characteristics of exotic fruit, citrus and tomato leaf. The mouthfeel is sharply etched and crisp with a very tonic and steely feel."
Spain,84.0,14.0,Jumilla,Casa de la Ermita,"Aromas of buttered noodles and honey fail to hold up in the glass. This sweet Macabeo feels a bit watery, with no complexity to the palate structure. Flavors of honey and vanilla are slightly bitter."
US,90.0,34.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"Extremely fresh and lively aromas of soft strawberry and lime pith combine to make a very racy edge to the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property, which was founded as a bubbly house in the early 1980s. There is great energy to the sip, where somewhat sour flavors of Ruby Red grapefruit rind give the wine lots of acidic length."
US,87.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Duckhorn,"There's grip around this wine's core of clove, plum and smoke but the lushness is muted, perhaps an indication of the tough growing year, while structure remains. Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc are blended in, the whole aged in 51% new French oak."
US,87.0,45.0,Paso Robles,Bella Luna,"Very ripe and fruity, in the Paso style, with tiers of sweet red and black cherry pie filling and spice flavors. The acidity, which must come from the Sangiovese, is quite high and a little invasive, but it's a charming wine."
France,87.0,13.0,Gaillac,ChÃ¢teau LabastidiÃ©,"Owned by the Wine Museum of Paris, this estate has 172-acres of vines. This wine is rich, spicy and with mature tannins and red fruits. It is all fruit, ripe and ready to drink."
Australia,91.0,72.0,McLaren Vale,Mitolo,"This dark-fruited, full-bodied Shiraz isn't for the faint of heart. Espresso, dark chocolate, roast meat and plum notes come together in a creamy-textured wine that finishes with a tart, hard edge of acidity and a dusting of cocoa powder-like tannins."
US,85.0,20.0,Texas High Plains,THP,"There's a solid grip to this blend of 54% Aglianico, 21% Montepulciano, 14% Tempranillo and 11% Barbera. Bramble berries and earthy geraniums give this medium-bodied red some interest."
Italy,89.0,50.0,Barolo,Olivero,"Blue flower, baked plum, vanilla and a whiff of resin lead the nose. The juicy, straightforward palate offers dried sour cherry, cranberry, anise and a hint of white pepper alongside fine-grained tannins."
US,91.0,36.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Cinnabar,"Here's a big, bold Pinot Noir that's almost like a Grenache in its full-bodied juiciness. It's very bright and ripe in black and red cherry, raspberry, milk chocolate and toffee flavors, with interesting spicy nuances of anise, cinnamon and pepper. Now through 2011."
US,88.0,32.0,El Dorado,Jodar,"This is an untamed traditional-style wine that is tannic to its core and may require 20 years to reach its peak of enjoyment. It has aromas of blackberry and black pepper, flavors of espresso and bitter chocolate and a titanic structure built with layer after layer of muscular tannins that leave quite an astringent effect on the finish. Best after 2025."
France,94.0,105.0,Champagne,Lanson,"Aged five years after bottling prior to release, this is an exceptional wine. It has the hallmark dryness of Lanson, along with toast and ripe white-fruit flavors. Its tangy with lemon zest and crisp apple flavors that meld harmoniously. Ready to drink now."
Argentina,91.0,20.0,Mendoza,Lagarde,"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Livio Felluga,"Friulano shows its best results in its native home?northeast Italy?where the wine expresses creamy richness followed by aromas of white peach, pear and honey. Pair it with shellfish or vegetable risotto."
France,91.0,100.0,Meursault,Bouchard AÃ®nÃ© et Fils,"Tangy and zesty, this crisp wine shows a strong sense of chalky terroir, with a mineral edge and tight acidity. These elements mean the wine will take time to age. Drink from 2021."
France,83.0,15.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,Clos FloridÃ¨ne,The wine is neither very fruity nor fresh. It is clean with a crisp aftertaste although the character or the interest are not there.
France,90.0,40.0,Sancerre,Domaine Laporte,"Hugely rich and in a seriously heavy bottle, this is a statement wine. Its texture is there, surrounded by superripe fruit and touches of pepper from the alcohol. This almost tropical-fruit wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2018."
US,89.0,13.0,Alexander Valley,Geyser Peak,"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated."
US,89.0,18.0,Yakima Valley,Kana,"Mostly Lemberger, from a 1979 planting, this is an explosion of sweet berry and milk chocolate?what's not to like? Luscious and full across the palate, it's a raspberry truffle in a bottle. Not sweet, so not for dessert, but in a way it is dessert all by itself."
Italy,95.0,105.0,Toscana,Marchesi Antinori,"The bottle that changed Italian wine forever, Tignanello is as modern and innovative as its first vintage many decades ago. Soft blackberry and cherry is backed by balanced spice, leather and toasted espresso. Those rich oak tones do a wonderful job of holding up the wine's natural richness and velvety smoothness. Hold 10 years or more."
US,87.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Rodney Strong,"Structured from the start, this wine provides succulent boysenberry and blackberry around a full-figured body that's otherwise steeped in vanilla and coffee, the toasted oak quite prevalent. It finishes slightly tart in dried herb and mushroom."
France,85.0,12.0,Entre-Deux-Mers,ChÃ¢teau Nicot,"This light, fruity and fragrant white has a strong herbaceous character that is recognizably Sauvignon Blanc. It is crisp, clean, fresh and ready to drink."
Spain,84.0,18.0,Rioja,Valdelana,"Aromas of tire rubber, graphite and wet cement are oak-driven and overshadow wine's berry components. A tannic, resiny palate is expected, given the nose. Heavy oak overshadows black-plum flavors, while the finish is oaky, minty and a touch green."
US,93.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Presqu'ile,"Heirloom tomatoes, tomato leaf, green olives, wild berries and green peppercorns make for a very herbal though entirely compelling expression of cool climate Pinot Noir. The green-pepper and tomato character carries onto the sip, delivering a very interesting wine though one that many seeking a riper style will not enjoy."
Argentina,87.0,22.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Luigi Bosca,"This copper-colored rosÃ© is based on 85% Pinot Gris and 15% Syrah. It smells of dried apricot and cantaloupe, while the palate feels fleshy and round. Moderately complex flavors of salt water and stone fruits finish full."
Italy,93.0,79.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Caparzo,"This elegantly structured red opens with aromas of dark-skinned berry, sunbaked earth, new leather, thyme and a whiff of pipe tobacco. The balanced, polished palate offers wild cherry, strawberry, vanilla, coffee and star anise alongside integrated tannins. It's already accessible and will offer fine drinking over the next several years. Drink through 2021."
US,85.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Bonterra,An unfussy Syrah with black raspberry flavors and subtle use of oak. It finishes short.
Italy,92.0,40.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Podere Paganico,"Mineral tones and oak tones will integrate with time. With the wine's other notes of black cherry, licorice, bresaola, white pepper and black currant. Beautiful harmony and intensity, with a firm, silky signature on the finish."
US,91.0,38.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"Classic Petite Sirah aromas leap off the nose of this bottling, including dense black rocks, crushed gravel and lava rocks, a touch of espresso bean and a light brush of purple flowers. The palate starts juicy with ripe blueberry then grows complex through charred meat, tar and coffee. The tannins are still stiff but will mellow slowly."
US,87.0,29.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Marie,"High-toned aromas of barrel spice, green pepper, cherry and herb lead to plump cherry flavors. It delivers enjoyment but seems a bit generic."
US,91.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,MacLaren,"This bone-dry, full-bodied Syrah has firm tannins and intense concentration. It's a little warm in alcohol, with flavors of dark chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, grilled bacon and black pepper, plus a coating of sweet, smoky oak. You might want to give this wine a year or so in the cellar to let everything meld together."
US,93.0,85.0,Ribbon Ridge,Archery Summit,"The Ribbon Ridge AVA is home to a small, select group of near-cult wineries, and fruit such as this is the reason why. Compact and refined, it delivers beautiful aromas of raspberries, with a subtle dustiness that might be Oregon's answer to Napa's famed Rutherford dust. Terrific concentration and pinpoint definition make this a wine to savor immediately, or cellar for enjoyment through 2025 and beyond."
France,88.0,15.0,Anjou,Domaine du Petit Clocher,Pure bright smoky fruits give this wine its edge of tannin and great red plum and spice flavors. Its youth adds a dry character to the fruitiness and acidity. Drink this from 2018.
US,90.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Everett Ridge,"Very pretty nose, with plenty of raspberry-focused fruit, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. Delicious, mouth-filling, concentrated wine, with a lot of finesse and a wonderful ripeness. Smooth tannins, long finish, with a touch of toast."
US,89.0,75.0,Sonoma Mountain,Ancient Oak Cellars,"Tannic and structured, this combines 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot, with a leathery, earthy fist-print of black fruit imprinted on the wine. It's big boned but not out of balance and can stand some time lying down, through 2018."
US,89.0,16.0,Central Coast,Fossil Point,"Though a slightly riper style of rosÃ© than is de rigeur today, this is a solid and lively wine, its ripe raspberry and red plum aromas cut by lime pith and squeezed lemon notes. Ruby red grapefruit, mulberry and baking spice elements pop on the palate."
Spain,86.0,14.0,Cava,Segura Viudas,"With a rusty salmon color, this Pinot Noir Cava offers citrus and red-fruit aromas along with earthy funk. The palate is generally well balanced, while smoky, earthy flavors of red fruits and citrus finish mild."
US,90.0,75.0,Howell Mountain,Howell Mountain Vineyards,"Soft and dusty, this is an herbal, elegant Cabernet from big mountain fruit, the tannins well-managed. It starts out with an intensity of black fruit followed by sturdy structure and a finish of chocolate and coffee."
France,84.0,12.0,CÃ´tes du Lot,Pelvillain FrÃ¨res,"The wine is perfumed and full. It is so soft, missing tannins, and already easy to drink. Black fruits are super-ripe and generous. Drink now."
US,92.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Cadence,"Despite coming from declassified barrels from the winery's other programs, the quality still hits a very high mark on this blend of Cabernet Franc (33%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%), Merlot (29%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas of cranberry, herbs, plum and mineral are generous followed by good depth to the fruit flavors and bitters on the finish. As always with this winery, it's the balance of acid and tannins that most impresses. Give a one hour decant."
France,92.0,180.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Towards the southern end of Chassagne, Morgeot is a large premier cru that once belonged to an abbey. This wine is full of fruit, spiced with the wood aging and with a strongly mineral texture. It has the potential to be rich, round and smooth. Wait until 2018."
Spain,91.0,60.0,Rioja,Bodegas Bilbainas,"Roasted berry, black pepper and mild leafy aromas are true to the region. The palate is full but not heavy or clumsy; flavors of earthy berry fruits show a touch of raisin, while the finish is loamy and smooth. Drink this approachable wine now through 2018."
France,89.0,30.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Gustave Lorentz,"Citric tartness dominates nose and palate, making for a spritzy, lime-flavored fizz with frothy bubbles. The dry palate is light yet fruity, making this fun, easy-drinking and refreshing."
US,86.0,35.0,Livermore Valley,Murrieta's Well,"A bit of a muted nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (24%), Petit Verdot (22%), Cab Franc (11%) and Malbec (1%) out of the Livermore Valley. A good balance of fruit and tannic power here, but not a ton of depth. The finish drops off a bit, too."
US,86.0,40.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Adelaida,"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now."
France,87.0,30.0,Sancerre,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin,"Fresh and with a herbaceous background, this is a tight, taut and mineral wine. It presents a definite tang of lemon zest, steeliness and a crisp aftertaste. It can be drunk now, although it will be better from 2016."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Sicilia,Morgante,"Nero d'Avola sometimes delivers a toasted note of pistachio or almond, and that nutty note is definitely found in this wine. Soft and smooth in texture, the palate offers notes of black fruit and plum."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Chianti Classico,Fattoria Tregole,"Here's a young Sangiovese with aromas of black fruit, espresso, leather and black pepper. The palate is straightforward and fresh, boasting ripe black cherry accented with white pepper and clove alongside bracing tannins."
US,90.0,38.0,Sonoma County,Jackson Estate,"This wine is made from a collection of vineyards dotted along mountainous ridge lines and benchlands, most of these spots along the Mayacamas Mountains. Winemaker Randy Ullom captures a classic character of dried sage, cedar and pencil shavings here, supporting the savory with bright acidity and a strong presence of tannin. This wine could stand more time in the bottle before enjoying; its youthful grip doesn't go without notice."
France,91.0,27.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Saget la PerriÃ¨re,"A blend of four of the best parcels from the Saget estate, this is a rich and structured wine. Its apple, citrus and yellow fruit flavors are just beginning to integrate with the tight, steely texture. Drink this wine from 2018."
US,92.0,46.0,Russian River Valley,Rochioli,"This isn't a long-term ager, but do give it about a year in the bottle to let all of its parts meld together. Right now, it's tight and oaky. It features intense, bright pineapple, green apple and orange flavors, with sweet barrel influences and a tenuous streak of acidity."
US,92.0,32.0,Seneca Lake,Hermann J. Wiemer,"Wiemer's CuvÃ©e Brut is fresher and more forward than the producer's longer-aged blanc de blanc. Yet amidst the cutting green apple and lemon, there's plenty of autolytic character, expressed as whispers of toast, rising dough and burnt sugar. It's vibrantly balanced by tiny, penetrating bubbles and a lingering, fresh finish."
US,93.0,53.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, deep and sappy, with the dark, licorice and coffee-infused complexity of Walla Walla's best bottles. Sharp and young, with a potent, liquorous finish, this explosive bottle of cassis-driven fruit should cellar well for a decade or more."
France,86.0,10.0,Pays d'Oc,Wild Pig,"Light scents of fresh grass, white flowers, waxy melon and sweet orange dance in the bouquet of this easy-drinking white. Those notes continue through to the fruity palate, with a pleasant roundness to the midpalate. Drink now."
Spain,85.0,13.0,Navarra,SeÃ±orÃ­o de Sarria,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine."
Spain,83.0,15.0,Alicante,Bocopa,"Floral aromas of lychee are indicative of basic Moscatel. This feels soft, with no angles or aggressiveness. Pithy, green-leaning flavors of lychee and lettuce finish with lychee notes and lasting sweetness."
France,93.0,117.0,Meursault,Olivier Leflaive,"From vines in the heart of this large appellation, this is a warmhearted and ripe wine. With wood and spice in equal balance with the white fruits, this is a juicy crisp wine full of great acidity and also with a ripe hint of yellow fruits. This fine wine will be best from 2020."
Argentina,85.0,13.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Collio,Gradis'ciutta,"Structured but polished, this vibrant wine has aromas of dried hay, honeydew melon and a touch of balsamic herbs. The succulent palate delivers juicy white peach, white grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity."
US,89.0,70.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"This wine is 95% Sangiovese and 5% Aglianico, hailing from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Serra Pedace vineyards. Aromas of cranberry, raspberry, and fruit leather lead to quite tart cranberry flavors. The concentration doesn't quite seem all there to stand up by itself but it should fit in well at the dinner table."
France,85.0,14.0,Buzet,Vignerons de Buzet,"This Bordeaux-style wine is ripe and rich, balance between dusty tannins and stalky red fruits. Acidity and an attractive generous texture give it shape. It is ready to drink."
US,90.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,KitÃ¡,"Underripe, slightly green orange peels mix with honeydew, grass and lime on this straightforward selection. The palate shows a touch of peach on the first part of the sip before delving into pungent grassiness that continues through the finish, all complemented by a wet stone frame."
US,91.0,85.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"Tart cranberry, black tea and dark plum characterize this earthy, soft and supple wine, made from grapes grown in a block at the crest of a knoll. Firm tannins give it an edginess, an unexpected complement to its warmth and depth of cardamom spice and blackberry."
Italy,92.0,48.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Caprili,"Big and bold, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, leather, forest floor, truffle and a whiff of aromatic herb. The muscular palate offers crushed black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon, anise and a hint of thyme framed in assertive but ripe tannins. Thanks to the juicy fruit flavors, you'll on barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the close."
US,91.0,23.0,Russian River Valley,VML,"Grapefruit rind jumps out of the glass in this vivid, balanced and refreshing white that also carries a complex mix of lime, more grapefruit and the tiniest suggestion of fresh-cut grass. A creaminess to the texture rounds things out and soothes the edges."
US,85.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Jax,"Soft, dry and delicious, with classic Napa tannins. It has lovely layers of blackberries and cassis, but also overripe raisin and prune notes that prohibit aging."
Italy,85.0,35.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Signano,"Aromas include oak extract, yellow flower, citrus zest and Mediterranean herb. The palate offers butterscotch and vanilla but not much fruit richness or freshness."
US,92.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Tamarack Cellars,"This wine is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), with the rest equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of dried herb, black cherry, licorice, cocoa and barrel spice give way to plentiful tart-cherry flavors backed by bright acidity and lightly chewy tannins. It stretches out on the finish."
US,86.0,24.0,Sierra Foothills,Chacewater,"Lots of ripe berry and pomegranate notes give a fruity profile to this dry, medium-bodied, fresh and lightly tannic wine. It will be a good quaffing wine for lunch or dinner with mushroom pizza or grilled chicken."
US,90.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,Luscious watermelon and berry aromas perfume this buoyantly fruity dry rosÃ©. It's robust in body and amped with concentrated red-cherry flavor but maintains deft balance. Lingering raspberry notes finish brisk and bright.
France,91.0,30.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Boutisse,"With vineyards to the east of Saint-Ãmilion itself, this chateau has produced a structured, obviously wood-aged wine. It's a wine still in development, bursting with young black-currant and black-plum fruits as well as acidity. The wood is a strong background presence and will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020."
Italy,86.0,32.0,Fiano di Avellino,Colli di Lapio,"Fiano di Avellino has its roots in ancient history and represents one of the best white wines to come from the south. This expression is bright and fresh with lingering mineral tones and peachy-floral aromas. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,San Pedro,"Mossy, foresty aromas are rugged and settle into blackberry. An intense, pushy palate is woody in feel, with hot, minty, oaky black-fruit flavors that improve with airing. Heat and toasty notes rise up on the finish of this bold Mendoza Malbec, a first from San Pedro (Chile)."
France,91.0,50.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Laroque,"Big, rich and elegant, this wine has fine, lifted black fruits layered over dry new wood and fruit tannins. It is certainly firm, and needs at least 4?? years' aging, but it will develop into a sophisticated, balanced wine."
Italy,84.0,9.0,Sicilia,Calatrasi,"Generous tones of banana, mature pear and stone fruit shape a fragrant and broad white wine from Sicily (made with Catarratto grapes). The wine's flat texture is a bit fat and thick in the mouth."
Italy,99.0,175.0,Barolo,Mascarello Giuseppe e Figlio,"Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework. It's already tempting and impeccably balanced but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2018??030."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Verdicchio di Matelica,Belisario,"Even though only 20% of this Riserva is aged in barriques, this internationally-styled Verdicchio shows dominant oak, vanilla and butterscotch sensations that overwhelm the more subtle floral and citrus characteristics."
US,91.0,50.0,Dundee Hills,Argyle,"This is made in a steely, high-acid style, harvested at low (18.5) brix and put through 25% malolactic just to keep it all in proportion. Give this some time in the glass and it shines, with a focused mix of lemon, apple and mineral flavors. This can easily age for another decade at least. Drink 2020??030."
US,87.0,18.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Coming from the warm 2012 vintage, the notes vary from stone fruit, such as apricot, into tropical with dried pineapple. Aged in a mixture of stainless steel and older French oak barrels, it's fresh and appealing while also displaying some weight and density, drinking quite dry with a tart finish."
France,86.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Dourthe,"Taut and with its youthful acidity still up front, this wine has good potential. Its crisp acidity and lively, bright character all promise well. Drink from late 2017."
US,92.0,52.0,Napa Valley,Robert Mondavi,"From an historic block of the famous vineyard long known as Robert's Block, this white is incredibly complex and concentrated, with richly woven layers of pear, Key lime and peach. A handful of SÃ©millon is blended in, adding extra oomph and flavor, the finish balanced in acidity and marked by freshness."
France,91.0,45.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau du Galoupet,"One of the cru classÃ© estates of CÃ´tes de Provence, Galoupet goes back to the 17th century. This latest vintage is a blend that includes a whole gallery of grapes. The result is a rich wine that benefits from the warmth of the year. It has kept plenty of bright acidity and red-currant flavors, leaving a tight, mineral, crisp aftertaste."
US,91.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Miro,"This thick, concentrated wine offers complex notions of sandalwood and soapstone, savory in pleasant ways. Clove accents the warmth of strawberry compote laced in rhubarb."
US,87.0,27.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Firestone,"A squeeze of lime acidity gives balance to honeyed orange, pear, Meyer lemon and vanilla-custard flavors in this wine. Nothing complicated here, just plenty of Chardonnay appeal."
US,90.0,78.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tenor,"Cabernet Sauvignon (84%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Herb, dark fruit, tobacco, carob and spice aromas are followed by ripe, tannic fruit flavors that seem to tussle at times."
Canada,89.0,45.0,Niagara Peninsula,Henry of Pelham,"A delicious though somewhat reserved wine with notes of lychee, honey, sugared pineapple and mint. It's rich in feel with abundant marmalade flavors, while staying well balanced and never going too over the top."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa Valley,St. SupÃ©ry,"Sweet aromas of white peach entice one into this lively wine, a profile that carries through to the delicate palate. A refreshing apÃ©ritif that finishes dry, the wine is light in alcohol and body."
US,85.0,30.0,Lodi,LangeTwins,"Jammy aromas, tangy raspberry and blackberry flavors and a firm vein of tannin make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy and firm enough to pair with big proteins."
US,86.0,28.0,Redwood Valley,Zina Hyde Cunningham,"A soft, luscious Zin, dry and firm in tannins, with forward flavors of raspberries, cherries, almond biscotti, mocha and dusty spices. Drink now."
US,89.0,28.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Jamie Slone Wines,"Lemon rinds, green apple skins, white flowers and a hint of pineapple guava decorate the nose of this wine from a former race car driver. It has tons of chalky mineral zing on the palate, which is crisp and light with grassy flavor and pithy grip."
US,88.0,45.0,Dundee Hills,Torii Mor,"This three-vineyard blend is still quite tight and tannic. Flavors of green tea and lemon oil abound, with lighter flavors of pie cherries. Drying tannins wrap it up."
Italy,85.0,10.0,Lambrusco di Sorbara,Cantina di Sorbara,"Intensely fruity, this simple dessert sparkler offers juicy raspberry, crushed red cherry and strawberry alongside vanilla and a confectionary note. Bright acidity offsets the semisweet flavors."
US,84.0,38.0,Contra Costa County,Turley,"There's something vegetal on this Zin that lowers its score. It's dry and smooth in tannins, and it shows some complexity, with pleasant blackberry flavor."
US,88.0,8.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Snoqualmie,"Fleshy and fruity, fresh and full bodied, this generous wine offers scents of orange peel and citrus, and the palate exudes ripe flavors of grapefruit, lime and a hint of melon."
US,84.0,28.0,Edna Valley,Tolosa,"A hard, tannic Syrah, difficult to fall in love with. Edna Valley's cool climate has given it tart acidity and wintergreen flavors, sweetened with oak."
US,94.0,200.0,Napa Valley,M by Michael Mondavi,"Expensive, yes, but defines the soft, luxurious modern style of extreme deliciousness. Made with a drop of Petit Verdot that seems to add depth, the wine is fantastically rich in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, chocolate and sweet oak. The tannins are a wonder, and there's just enough acidity to give a balanced tang. Will it age? Yes, but for how long is the question. Beautiful now and through 2019."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Isola dei Nuraghi,Pala,"Ripe and chewy, this earthy wine opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched soil, grilled herb and game. The big, round palate doles out ripe blackberry, spiced blueberry, licorice and ground pepper alongside velvety tannins."
US,87.0,20.0,Rogue Valley,Bridgeview,"Beets, mint and cola mark the aromas of this robust offering from the southern part of the state. It?s rich and corpulent?almost Port-like in its dimensions?and although it lacks a bit of elegance, it certainly possesses plenty of mouth-filling flavor."
US,95.0,70.0,Wahluke Slope,K Vintners,"Aromas of pomegranate, black fruit, herb and barrel spice lead to rich seamless palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It's hedonistic but retains a sense of balance along with an unabashed deliciousness."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Vite Colte,"This leads with forest floor, blue flower and black-skinned berry aromas while the structured, savory palate offers black cherry, red plum and Asian spice hints. Supple tannins and vibrant acidity provide easygoing support and freshness. Enjoy through 2021."
Argentina,87.0,20.0,Cafayate,Michel Torino,"More minerally and tight than most, with a bit of brine and lettuce to go with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is citrusy and features a beam of bright acidity that props up melon and citrus flavors. Full and forceful late, with some burn to the finish."
France,90.0,30.0,Montagne-Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Haut-Goujon,"This is a limited production wine?a rich and firmly tannic. It has weight and density, backed plum skin and blackberry notes. It's all wrapped in a concentrated, structured package. Age for at least 4 years."
US,86.0,50.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Vogelzang,"Give this tough, young Cabernet a good long decant before serving. At first, it's dominated by sharp acidity and mouth-numbing tannins. But after some airing, it offers black currant flavors. This is likely not an ager."
US,89.0,32.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Seagrape,"Crisp in acidity and fine in tannins, this Pinot Noir is good now with food. It's silky and dry, with nuanced flavors of wild raspberries and cherries, cola, dried herbs and oak. Has enough balance and acidity to develop bottle complexity over the next 4-6 years."
France,87.0,11.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Lamothe-Vincent,"This mineral-driven and white-currant-flavored wine shows as much texture as fruitiness. In the future, it will show ripe yellow and pear notes, so age for a year."
US,91.0,44.0,Fort Ross-Seaview,Failla,"Lots of purity, with acidity and stony minerality providing earthy balance to the lemon, lime and mango fruit flavors. Thoroughly dry, it's a classy wine to drink now."
France,91.0,25.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Landat,"Dry and serious, this firm wine is classic Bordeaux. It has weight, a core of tannins and black currant fruitiness that needs time to fully integrate with the dense structure. Give this exemplary wine another five years."
US,90.0,39.0,Sonoma County,Francis Ford Coppola,"Cola spice and eager acidity mark this blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Zinfandel, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Syrah, which spent time in both French and American oak. Soft and medium in weight, it's enjoyable now and an easy crowd pleaser, with a long, spicy finish."
US,93.0,70.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Sanford,"Exotic aromas of cranberry, plum, sandalwood, myrrh and lavender makes for an elegant entry to this bottling by the winemaking team of Steve Fennell and Laura Roach. Layered flavors of tart cherry and pomegranate are laced throughout by dried herbs, while the tannic structure is firm but not obtrusive. Drink 2018??034."
US,87.0,19.0,Russian River Valley,Novy,"This vineyard is far better known for Pinot Noir, although Failla has excelled with its Chardonnay. Novy's 2010 isn't particularly like Chardonnay. Too floral. Could almost be Viognier. Yet it's a fine wine, crisp and rich in orange, lime and honeysuckle flavors."
Spain,89.0,29.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Clunia,"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas mixed with oak scents amount to an inviting, solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is healthy, full-bodied and showing plenty of kick. Flavors of berry fruits, plum and roasted notes end with jammy berry flavors and a good texture. Drink now??015."
US,89.0,30.0,Central Coast,Brecon Estate,"Intensely plush aromas of peach, daffodil, sweet rose and even pineapple show on the nose of this botting. There's lots of sizzle to the racy sip, where tart green apple, green pear and green-tomato flavors make for a tangy, refreshing wine."
US,86.0,16.0,California,Great American Wine Company,"Lots of grapy, raisiny flavors drench this wine with fruitiness, while a smooth, soft texture and touch of sweetness keep the texture mild. It's medium bodied, not at all tannic, and easy to sip."
US,94.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Volker Eisele Family Estate,"From the producer's organic estate in Chiles Valley, Las Flores is a block named for the family who has long helped farm the land and that bursts in wild mustard every spring. In the glass, the wine offers grippy black pepper, black cherry and tobacco flavors?bold and juicy yet retentive in structure and graceful beauty."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Montefalco Rosso,Cantina Fratelli Pardi,"Made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this opens with subtle aromas of red berry and underbrush. The straightforward palate delivers black plum, clove and tobacco alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
US,87.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Valley of the Moon,"This combines 85% Pinot Blanc with 15% Viognier. Together, they offer a full, fleshy and fruit-forward expression of peach and pineapple that's fresh in uplifting acidity."
Argentina,86.0,13.0,Mendoza,Mil Piedras,"Blueberry and cassis aromas are jammy and suggest graham crackers. This feels tight and narrow, with strict tannins. As for flavors, look for baked berry, herb and earth notes the finish shows berry,  leather and carob notes."
Italy,85.0,16.0,Lazio,Villa Gianna,"This is a ripe and slightly jammy expression of Cabernet Sauvignon with tones of strawberry and raspberry back by a lush, soft mouthfeel. There is a chewy quality to the finish."
US,90.0,25.0,Santa Clara Valley,Guglielmo,"A dusty, plummy, dark berry pie Petite Sirah from old vines grown in the Santa Clara Valley by the Guglielmo family, who have been based here since 1925. With lots of bittersweet chocolate, white pepper and well-integrated oak, this Petite is subtle, its alcohol relatively low and its tannins quite refined, a Petite for French palates."
US,89.0,46.0,Red Mountain,The Walls,"This wine is half Grenache, with the balance MourvÃ¨dre (31%), Syrah (14%) and Counoise. Lighter in color, it brings aromas of cranberry, cherry, spice, smoked meat and herb. The tart cranberry flavors are full bodied, showing a sense of purity and balance, pulling up a bit on the finish."
Argentina,92.0,33.0,Mendoza,Revancha,"Revancha is a new line of wines from esteemed winemaker Roberto de la Mota. This blends Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc. On the nose, it is spicy, lightly herbal and deep in fruit. A tight palate shows raw tannins and flavors of wild berry and oak-based coconut. Dry, flashy and a bit rough on the finish, this will benefit from a few more years in bottle. Drink through 2020."
France,90.0,24.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bertinerie,"Very structured wine that shows its wood aging as well as textured black plum fruits. It has spice, toast and a smoky character. Underneath are blackberry fruits and a strong layer of acidity. Age for 3?? years."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Buena Vista,"All of the charms of this Merlot, Syrah and Zinfandel blend are on the surface, but what a pretty surface it is. Polished raspberry and cherry fruit, bacon, cream and a splendid array of flashy spices characterize the flavors."
Italy,91.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Casale dello Sparviero,"Here's a ripe and velvety Riserva with luscious, warm tones of dark spice, chocolate, tobacco smoke and root beer. The wine is fresh and crisp in the mouth with firm structure and very good density."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Ca' dei Zago,"This elegant sparkler opens with alluring aromas of fragrant jasmine, wisteria and white peach. Thanks to 80-year old vines, the linear palate has both finesse and concentration, offering ripe yellow apple, Bartlett pear, energizing mineral tones and a saline note alongside a creamy mousse."
US,88.0,23.0,Willamette Valley,Brigadoon,"The first release annually from the estate vineyard, this is a solid effort, seemingly infused with scents and flavors of pine needle, pine tar, earth and bark. The fruit is in the background, and leans toward cranberry and brambly blackberry."
France,88.0,25.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,LabourÃ©-Roi,"Typically soft and ripe, this is already a delicious, fruity wine. It is strongly perfumed and has the acidity typical of the vintage. Ripe red fruits and acidity are well balanced, with dry tannins that are still in the background. Drink the wine from 2018."
US,92.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Fess Parker,"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine."
US,88.0,17.0,Oregon,King Estate,"Spicy scents introduce a fresh and fleshy pear-flavored Pinot Gris, with a crisp underpinning of wet stone and medium acids. Citrus peel, light orange and pineapple weave into the midpalate, and the wine fills the mouth without being heavy."
US,87.0,46.0,Napa Valley,Alpha Omega,"Very rich, with freshly crushed pineapple, grilled ripe peach, buttered toast and caramelized vanilla cream flavors. Could have greater structure, as it's a little soft for all that weight, but it's a fancy Chardonnay."
France,92.0,57.0,Champagne,Delamotte,"Based in the Chardonnay region of the CÃ´te des Blancs, it's no surprise that this producer has a dominance of that grape in its blend. The wine has great minerality as well as tight acidity and delicious citrus flavors. It's a dry, finely balanced wine to drink now."
France,89.0,32.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler,"Fresh notes of crisp apple, with grassy hints, on the nose turn to rounded and mellow red-apple notes on the palate. The tiny bubbles make for a creamy mouthfeel while some biscuity notes provide substance. It makes an elegant and dry apÃ©ritif."
US,92.0,82.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"One of the most ripe, opulent and unctuous of the Anderson Valley wines, this full-bodied bottling smells and tastes like cinnamon, cherries, milk chocolate and brown sugar, but not as sweet as that sounds. The texture is very broad and mouth-coating and the alcohol feels on the high side, giving a feeling of power with polish."
Italy,92.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Villa Cafaggio,"This is a beautiful wine from a great vintage. It has a rich fragrance of underbrush, mushroom and truffle, with ripe black-cherry, mint and rosemary accents. It's still young with exuberant but supple tannins and racy acidity. Drink 2016??025."
US,94.0,75.0,Adelaida District,Daou,"This blend of 44% Malbec, 33% Petit Verdot and 23% Cabernet Franc shows lots of meaty notes on the nose, including both the charred edges and raw center of a prime rib slice, alongside blueberry and cedar oil. The blueberry core holds strong into the sip, where finely chiseled tannins provide a chalky mouthfeel and carry more flavors of black olive and charred wood."
US,85.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Merry Cellars,"The high alcohol (15.5%) and pruney character suggests that this was picked late?a bit too late to retain any elegance. The acids are sharp and citric and not well integrated, leaving the fruit almost invisible. Decanting opens it up a bit; this is an excellent vineyard, but it has not been all that well served here."
Australia,85.0,25.0,Yarra Valley,Arthur's Creek,"Wow?talk about contrasts. The nose is way over the top, a grotesque parody of a butterscotch sundae. The finish is multilayered and complex, featuring echoes of toast and white peaches. In between is a somewhat neutral-tasting wine. You may love it or you may hate it?it's that kind of wine."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Casa Solar,"Red-fruit aromas lead the charge, but they come with a green, candied component. This is flabby in feel, with minty berry flavors and a modest finish."
US,90.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Pellegrini,"Fleshy and briny, this wine hails from the producer's own marquee vineyard, situated in the heart of the Olivet Lane district. Ripe, with a buttery undertone, it's classic in its rendering of Gravenstein apple and pear flavors?balanced, yet with a robust frame."
US,88.0,16.0,North Coast,Bonny Doon,"Clean and crisp aromas of Asian pear, lemongrass, honeysuckle, passion fruit and green plum show on the nose of this blend of 64% SÃ©millon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc. The palate would go down very easy on a hot day, with just a touch of acid-carrying flavors of gardenia, guava, mango and kaffir lime leaf."
Italy,87.0,58.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Romeo,"Aromas of tilled soil, overripe black plum, fleshy black cherry and a hint of farmyard lead the nose and carry through to the full-bodied palate. It's ripe, round and ready, with evolved tannins and soft acidity so drink soon."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Toscana,Rascioni e Cecconello,"Made with 85% Vermentino, 10% Viognier and 5% Sauvignon, this has aromas of Mediterranean scrub and yellow peach that carry on to the round fresh palate. It closes with white almond."
Argentina,88.0,30.0,Mendoza,El Enemigo,"In the past we said the enemy of El Enemigo was too much oak; that heavy oak character persists, but it is more integrated than in prior bottlings. Along with woody aromas, look for cidery apple scents in front of a soft, chunky palate. Flavors of popcorn, caramel and baked apple finish weighty and woody. Drink now."
Argentina,82.0,11.0,Mendoza,Origin,"Candied and thin on the nose, and that's pretty much what follows. The palate is dilute, while the flavors of red fruits are crisp and semisour. Scratchy and tart on the finish as well."
US,91.0,65.0,Howell Mountain,Summit Lake,"From a small family-run operation that is 100% estate, this Cab is thick in blueberry and blackberry, almost syrupy rich. With a big juicy backbone, it offers a full-figured body and leathery texture, ending explosively with notes of black licorice and toffee. Cellar through 2020."
US,86.0,11.0,California,Little Black Dress,"There's a lot of residual sugar in this low-alcohol wine. It's frankly sweet in orange, peach and vanilla flavors, but a crisp edge of acidity makes it finish clean and vibrant."
US,88.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mounts,"This robustly ripe wine opens in a landscape of rustic earthiness before unleashing thick wallops of black licorice, leather and smoky oak. The tannins are grippy in a positive way, rising to meet the ripeness halfway."
France,91.0,18.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Arthur Metz,"A totally fresh nose of lemon, wet stone and greengage creates an enticing opening. These flavors also present themselves on the light palate, where they are dispersed by a fine, creamy mousse. The impression is one of light-bodied but fruity cleanness. This refreshing, brisk and enlivening sparkler is ready now, but will continue to develop through 2022."
Australia,89.0,25.0,Tasmania,Ninth Island,"A fine example of one of Tasmania's most celebrated styles, this bubbly starts with notes of lemon, white pepper and blossoms. The lemon and floral combo continues on the palate, which is on the leaner side texturally but satisfies with a mouth-tingling mousse and a slight sweetness, balanced with refreshing acidity."
US,84.0,80.0,Oakville,Cosentino,"Overly sweet and lacking in vibrant acidity, this Cab has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. It's a clean, simple wine for drinking now."
US,87.0,28.0,Sonoma County,Matanzas Creek,"This Merlot, blended with a little Cabernet Sauvignon, is oaky and fairly hot with high alcohol. But it's delicious with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate and anise. A fine grilled steak will do it justice."
US,91.0,125.0,Sonoma Valley,Lasseter,"This concentrated, full-bodied wine blends 80% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, all grown from the producer's Upper Bench blocks known for cobbly soils. Brick, tar and pencil shavings accent a considerable presence of tannin and toasty oak. It should show best from 2020 to 2022."
France,92.0,29.0,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,"The faintest hint of fir honey appears on the nose. Underneath that and on the palate apple fruit holds sway, presenting an interplay between ripe and tart flesh. The palate is dry but nonetheless has that touch of dark, bitter fir honey. This has drive and linearity and a lasting, clean, apple-fruited finish."
Italy,87.0,34.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Il Marroneto,"Sensations of dark cherry, cinnamon-spice and a hint of orange peel can't support the searing alcohol that throws this out of balance. Drink now to capture the remaining freshness."
Italy,92.0,40.0,Vino Spumante,Murgo,"Made with Nerello Mascalese grown along the high slopes of Mount Etna, this radiant sparkler boasts aromas of small red berries, Spanish broom, bread crust and crushed stone. The luminous palate delivers strawberry, apple, Mediterranean herb, citrus and mineral alongside bright acidity and an elegant perlage."
US,84.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Convergence Zone,The aromas of mandarin orange and apricot seem to show a touch of oxygen exposure. This drinks just off dry with stone-fruit flavors throughout.
US,88.0,185.0,Oakville,B Cellars,"This Cabernet Sauvignon has enormously high alcohol that results in a glyceriney sweetness. However, in that category it's one of the best of the vintage. Hard to imagine a wine richer in currants and mocha, and the tannins are as beautiful as any Napa has ever produced. But it's difficult to see the wine aging well, so drink it soon with the most Cabernet-friendly food you can find."
Spain,93.0,85.0,Ribera del Duero,Bodegas Fuentespina,"This wine leads with tire rubber, bacon, forest floor, juniper and blackberry aromas, requiring as much air or time as you can give. In the mouth, it's hard, tannic and almost astringent. A mix of oak and herb-laced black fruit flavors finishes long, with plenty of energy and power in reserve. Drink 2018??027."
Argentina,91.0,22.0,Mendoza,Zuccardi,"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it. Drink now through 2012."
Spain,87.0,8.0,Navarra,Vega Sindoa,"Reddish in color, with solid aromas of tire rubber, cherry and plum. The palate shows fine lift and balance, and the flavors of juicy, slightly pithy and bitter raspberry and plum are just right for Navarran Garnacha-based rosÃ©. Drink soon with salads and finger foods."
Italy,83.0,18.0,Chianti Classico,Stomennano,"Aromas that suggest cellar floor, scorched earth, worn leather and weedy underbrush lead the nose. The evolved, diluted palate offers raisin, prune, coffee and a green note of powdered sage alongside dusty, fleeting tannins that lead to an abrupt, astringent finish."
US,89.0,48.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Talley,"Roasted peach, cinnamon and crushed vanilla bean make for an intriguing nose on another solid Talley bottling. It's soft and approachable at first, but then a bit brash and youthful, but will mellow with some patience. Drink 2017 onward."
US,92.0,135.0,Napa Valley,Crosby Roamann,"This tiny production blend surely is made in the modern cult style. Its tannins are soft and sexy, its flavors deep and delicious with milk chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and buttery toast. The only thing it lacks is subtlety, but it does deserve its score for sheer Napa power."
US,88.0,25.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"A deep color, ripe fruit flavors and a richly tannic texture make this full-bodied wine mouth-filling and satisfying without being heavy. A nice, moderate, spicy oak layer under the blackberries and a hint of pepper add welcome complexity."
US,91.0,64.0,Yakima Valley,Andrew Will,"This wine is a blend of Merlot (44%), Cabernet Sauvignon (34%) and Cabernet Franc. Fragrant aromas of raspberries, orange peel, red currant and garden herbs lead to restrained but sumptuous fruit flavors backed by a lick of tart acidity. It brings a sense of presence and depth."
US,92.0,45.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Waxwing,"Cherry tomatoes, black olives, Kalamata olives, green olives, black pepper and dried herbs show on the nose of this zesty wine, done in a lavish not sparse manner. A rainbow of peppercorns pop on the palate, touching on the grape's herbaceous tendencies and showing tagine and tapenade flavors, but with tons of vibrancy and freshness. A well-done version of this flavor profile."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,Bortolotti,"A distinctly different Prosecco with a colorful aromatic lineup that sets it apart: Yellow fruit, green tea, white stone and nutty almond (10% Chardonnay is added). It delivers a clean, crunchy texture and sweet peach flavors."
Italy,90.0,38.0,Montecucco,Amantis,"Aromas of purple flower and wild berry lead the nose on this blend of 60% Sangiovese, 22% Merlot, 10% Canaiolo 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Colorino. The easy-drinking, chewy palate doles out black raspberry, Morello cherry, black pepper and baking spice alongside polished tannins. Drink through 2017."
Italy,90.0,18.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Baricci,"Pretty aromas of underbrush, crushed blue flower and perfumed berries lead the nose on this robust Rosso. The dense palate delivers succulent black cherry, raspberry, mocha and sweet cake spices alongside firm tannins. It's not an ager so enjoy soon."
US,82.0,11.0,California,Forest Glen,"As sweet as a dessert wine, with sugary raspberry, cherry and spice flavors."
Italy,87.0,42.0,Bolgheri,Tenuta Sette Cieli,"Aromas of dark berry, clove, bell pepper and cedar take shape in the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, oak and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need time, the fruit is already starting to dry up."
US,88.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Alto Adige,Kupel Wieser,"Fruity and fresh, this opens with scents of apple orchard and a whiff of citrus zest. The refined, straightforward palate offers pear and a touch of mineral alongside bright acidity. It closes crisp and clean."
France,88.0,23.0,VirÃ©-ClessÃ©,Domaine AndrÃ© Bonhomme,"Showing some wood-aging aromas, this is a rich, tropical fruit-flavored wine balanced by acidity that goes with its peach and mango flavors. Ready to drink, it will be even better in 2015."
Italy,87.0,70.0,Toscana,Michele Satta,"Michele Satta's estate is located in the southernmost part of the denomination. This Sangiovese-based wine offers delicate nuances of blackberry, spice box and dried hay but also has natural rubber or Band-Aid notes that disturb an otherwise pretty picture. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Soave,Fattori,"This full-bodied white opens with aromas of dried apricots, ripe pear and a whiff of alcohol. The round, forward palate offers concentrated yellow peach, citrus, lemon drop, ginger and a hint of bread crust."
US,85.0,23.0,Monticello,Glass House,"Honeyed graham cracker, shrimp consommÃ© and wet stone notes make for an idiosyncratic nose. Delicate flavors of citrus, pear and mineral add interest to the palate, and the lively acidity provides a pleasing cut. Pair this with shucked oysters or grilled clams."
US,90.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Raptor Ridge,"The winery's Willamette Valley cuvÃ©e is right on target in 2012, loaded with luscious cranberry/raspberry fruit. Fresh and racy, with added spice and a dash of dark chocolate, this is a palate-pleaser from start to finish."
US,90.0,22.0,Yakima Valley,Kestrel,"This blend of Merlot and MourvÃ¨dre melds fruit from the Kestrel View and Olsen Vineyards. Bursting with mixed plum and cherry flavors, it's accented by a spice note and a streak of nougat."
US,88.0,15.0,Lake Chelan,Tildio,"At 1.8% residual sugar, this estate-grown Riesling carries some definite sweetness, along with a tangy mix of lime, grapefruit and citrus peel. Leesy and textural, it puts the focus on citrus rather than floral flavors, and tails off in the finish."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Toscana,Sangervasio,"Made entirely with Merlot, the shy nose eventually reveals whiffs of violet and clove. The medium-bodied palate offers prune, vanilla and French oak alongside chewy tannins and rather modest acidity."
US,89.0,41.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reininger,"Pure Syrah from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and Ash Hollow vineyard fruit, this shows the maturing of Walla Walla vines, which more and more reveal the earthy, herbal, garrigue qualities of the grape. Coopered in neutral oak, it showcases the typicity and regionality of the grape. Funk, earth, seaweed, green tobacco, and a hint of pepper dominate. You might wish for more fruit, but for those who love the funk this is a fine bottle."
US,88.0,14.0,California,Stevenot,"Stevenot has a good record at producing this stainless-steel-fermented wine. It's a savory, complex white, with high acidity framing honeyed flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, papayas, pine tar, slate and vanilla, with a hint of petrol. That sweet-tart tension makes the wine the perfect foil for Asian fusion fare."
Italy,82.0,16.0,Chianti Classico,Campomaggio,"Just swamped by oak, the slight fruit here is a platform for the wood, yielding heavy cedar and prune flavors. It looks a bit old?odd at this age?and although even on the palate, it doesn't offer much in the way of mouthfeel or finish. Perhaps in the barrel too long, this wine is gone before its time."
Italy,91.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Tolaini,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this elegant Chianti has enticing ripe red berry, violet and baking spice scents. The palate doles out succulent black cherry, leather and clove notes, while firm, savory tannins offer support. Enjoy through 2021."
US,87.0,65.0,Rutherford,William Harrison,"This 100% varietal wine offers a simplicity of blueberry, black licorice and chocolate wrapped in integrated tannin and oak. Full bodied and ripe, it softens in the glass to a rounded finish."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Sicilia,Firriato,"Harmonium is a gorgeous, opulent wine with a generous bouquet that is packed tight with blackberry, cherry liqueur, dark mocha, toasted vanilla bean and bright touches of black licorice. It's a very pleasurable and elaborate interpretation of Sicily's number one indigenous grape."
US,89.0,25.0,Mendocino County,Paul Dolan,"Balanced for dinner-time drinking, this lively and concentrated wine has fresh fruit flavors, moderate tannins and good acidity. Raspberry and blackberry notes blend with hints of smoke and black pepper to keep it interesting on the lingering finish."
Spain,82.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Bodegas FariÃ±a,"Rubbery on the nose, this has berry aromas lurking below. On the palate, it feels acidic, with tart raspberry flavors. It's lean on the finish, with a touch of oak."
US,85.0,16.0,Napa County,Sterling,"Creamy vanilla and fig combine around a thick texture complemented by bright, consistent waves of ripe tangerine. The finish is short, filled in by more citrus."
France,90.0,23.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau la Gordonne,"Pale in color, this is a delicious, ripe and also fresh rosÃ©. Crisp, bright acidity comes from the raspberry flavors that are light and perfumed. The wine has structure as well as a mineral texture. Drink now, although it will be very enjoyable until 2017."
France,92.0,19.0,Vouvray,ChÃ¢teau Gaudrelle,"This wine is rich with smooth ripe fruit that give the impression that it is off dry. In fact, it is the intensity of the fruit that is the driving force behind the wine. With acidity strongly in the background, there is a crisp element to this fine lemon and apricot-flavored wine. Drink from 2019."
US,95.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Sandhi,"Lime and apple blossoms, gray slate, wet chalk, a touch of struck match and an ever-so-slight lemon-butter element converge on a wondrous nose in this Rajat Parr-Sashi Moorman winner. Once sipped, the tight citrus hits first, but then come approachable white flowers, golden pears and a touch of ghee and vanilla on the back end."
Italy,88.0,26.0,Sicilia,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"This shows pristine qualities, with white flower, citrus, peach and honey notes. The density it imparts on the palate is also impressive and creamy."
France,91.0,27.0,Alsace,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg,"With its firm structure and strongly steely tendencies, this wine will repay aging. Orange citrus is woven into the texture of the wine, showing acidity and a taut, tangy aftertaste. It will need time to come together, so drink from 2018."
US,86.0,8.0,California,Twisted,"A zippy, lively version, this light-bodied wine smells and tastes like a combo of grapefruit, lemon and peach juices, having a crisp character on first sip, and a rich softness on the second."
US,88.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"This 100% varietal wine comes from older plantings at this vineyard. Aromas of plum, barrel spice and herb are up front followed by sweet black-fruit flavors. It shows hang time on the finish."
US,87.0,42.0,Mendocino Ridge,Cartograph,"Although there's only 25% new oak on this wine, it's dominated in youth by caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. That makes it awkward, despite ripe, forward cherry and raspberry fruit. Might calm down after a few years."
US,83.0,35.0,Dry Creek Valley,Wellington,"The bell pepper, cedar and green bean notes in this wine come across as astringent and thin."
US,88.0,15.0,Oregon,Eola Hills,"The reserve Chardonnay from Eola Hills gets an extra year in bottle, and it has a more elegant, vertical structure, with the fruit framed in toasty oak flavors and some tarragon spice. It's persistent as well; the flavors seem to gather strength in the midpalate and continue through a strong and moderately complex finish."
US,84.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Le Vigne di Domenico,"Shows good blackberry and currant flavors, but there's something off in the mouthfeel. It's a sharpness, a rugged, tart green chlorophyll feeling that suggests unripe tannins."
US,91.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Jordan,"The winery is making new strides by finding the best sites for its wines rather than trying to grow everything on its estate. This Chardonnay is a case in point. High in acidity and low in oak influence, it offers restrained layers of tropical mango, lemon and ginger snap."
US,90.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Barrister,"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style."
France,94.0,262.0,Champagne,Taittinger,"The lively mousse carries this sophisticated wine, which is the perfect partner to the Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs. Everything is in its place, well integrated and with great precision. This trends to the sweeter side of Brut but with bottle age this has brought fine secondary flavors that are ripe and rich. The wine will age further, drink until 2020."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Mendoza,Bodega Toneles,"Ripe plum and berry aromas are supported by a full dose of smoky, savory oak. The palate is round yet jagged, while flavors of toasty, chocolaty berry fruits are also lightly herbal and heavily oaked."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi,Santa Barbara,"Here's a charming wine that opens with delicate floral aromas of white flowers and stone fruits. The palate offers banana, pineapple and creamy white-peach flavors alongside freshening acidity. It finishes on a bitter almond note."
France,83.0,12.0,France,Kriter,"Fruit-forward and simple, this wine's pleasant apple and citrus flavors begin to dull as the carbonation rapidly fades in the glass."
Italy,91.0,45.0,Sicilia,Valle dell'Acate,"Lush and balanced, this 80-20 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah offers attractive notes of chocolate fudge, espresso and spice in the foreground of berry fruit. The wine has dense structure and bitter cherry flavors that ride long on the finish."
US,92.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Siduri,"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, though the label simply reads Willamette Valley. Light toast and dark fruits abound, with black cherry, char and roasted-coffee flavors leading the charge. Utterly delicious, this is a fine single-vineyard offering from Adam Lee. The barrel aging is subtle and complex, with a hint of coconut in the finish."
Spain,83.0,15.0,Rioja,Bodegas Valdemar,"Flat aromas include iodine, butterscotch and cider, but overall the nose isn't that lively or fresh. The palate, meanwhile, is round, soft and mealy, with oaky, barrel-fermented flavors of buttered baked apple and resin. Proves why barrel-fermented Viura is sketchy terrain."
US,89.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,"While stridently oak driven, this Chardonnay keenly maintains a core of fresh pear and apple flavor amidst layers of spice and caramel. It's supple and silky in texture, finishing on a lingering kiss of vanilla cream."
Argentina,91.0,88.0,Mendoza,Antigal,"Earthy balsamic aromas of cheesy oak, blackberry and cassis feed into a saturated tannic palate that's a touch scratchy and abrasive. Stewy blackberry and cassis flavors come with a dollop of vanilla and cheese, while this ends with muscular, grabby tannins. Drink this rich, heavy Malbec through 2022."
US,91.0,28.0,Lodi,Fenestra,"Touches of wood smoke and cardamom give an exotic streak to this full-bodied and dark-colored wine. It has deep fruit flavors like blackberry and prune, good balance and light tannins to enhance the texture."
France,91.0,24.0,CÃ´tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,ChÃ¢teau Gassier,Organically grown grapes from one of the top Provence estates have produced this light grey-pink colored wine. It is a delicious fruity confection of bright red berries and tangy acidity. There is an attractive touch of minerality to give the wine structure. Drink now.
Italy,86.0,30.0,Irpinia,I Capitani,"This blend of Aglianico, Merlot and Sangiovese opens with aromas of ripe black plum, toasted oak, chocolate and game. The thick, one-dimensional palate is overripe, offering stewed black cherry, prune, vanilla and chocolate alongside drying wood tannins."
US,85.0,12.0,California,Mirassou,"A fairly simple wine, it's rich in mouthwatering acidity, with ripe citrus, tropical fruit, melon and honey flavors. Unoaked, this should be versatile with a broad range of foods."
France,97.0,698.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau La Mission Haut-Brion,"With 83% SÃ©millon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022."
Italy,86.0,22.0,Lugana,Fraccaroli,"Made from old vines and aged in small barrels, this wine is dominated by oak. Opening aromas include wood, toast and a hint of butter and apples. Oak extract takes center stage on the palate which also reveals citrus peel and a hint of apricot and mineral, as well as firm acidity. It lacks fruit richness."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,Masciarelli,"What sets this wine apart is its gorgeous, creamy intensity on the finish. Made from Trebbiano, this expression shows the qualitative heights this variety can achieve. Notes of vanilla cream, peach cobbler, dried sage and pineapple appear on the bouquet. The finish is long and full. Try aging this for five years or longer."
US,82.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Northwest Cellars,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%), Merlot (35%), Syrah (22%) and CarmenÃ¨re, this offers aromas of green tea, sawdust, blueberry and barnyard. The flavors are tangy and elegant in style."
US,93.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Left Bend,"Winemaker Gary Robinson named this brand after the San Andreas Fault, which caused the appellation that birthed this aromatic display of blueberry, lilac and hummingbird sage. Dense purple fruit flavors consume the hedonistic palate, which is bolstered by bacon fat, licorice and a strong and lively acidity."
Spain,85.0,15.0,Catalunya,Clos Mont-Blanc,"Floral blueberry and inky aromas make for a concentrated, demanding bouquet. This four-grape blend is grabby and raw in feel, with pinching tannins. Briny, medicinal plum and berry flavors finish with a note of latex as well as heat."
France,86.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau la France,"This wine has a strongly tannic, dry character from the Malbec-inspired blend of 52% Merlot, 31% Malbec and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. However the ripe blackberry fruits are match enough, giving ripe flavors with a squeeze of acidity and richness at the end. Drink from 2016."
Spain,90.0,32.0,Ribera del Duero,Protos,"Traditional oak-based aromas of mint, dill, tobacco, vanilla and coconut sit on top of tarry black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this is a snappy, tight, structured wine with flavors of oak, coffee, licorice, spice and blackberry. It's stylish on the finish, with toasty, peppery flavors that linger for a good, long while."
US,86.0,15.0,Rogue Valley,Del Rio,This bold and fruity rosÃ© carries scents and flavors of cherry candy. It's a fine bottle for chilling and sharing with summer picnic foods.
US,87.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Terlato,"Break out the hors d'oeuvres for this tart young Pinot Grigio. It needs food to balance it out. The acid-backed flavors are savory, and include Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass and sweet butter. Try with delicious little fish and pork appetizers baked in phyllo."
US,93.0,44.0,Santa Barbara County,Epiphany,"Fess Parker's sister winery hits a savory home run with this blend of 62% Syrah and 38% Grenache, which presents game, leather, blackberry extract and sage on the nose. Purple fruit leads the palate, with dark chocolate on the midpalate and strong acidity and smooth tannins throughout."
Italy,88.0,34.0,Barbaresco,Rattalino,"This opens with aromas of red berry, rose petal, roasted coffee bean and brown cooking spice. On the palate, notes of anise, sage and white pepper accent raw red cherry alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2018??024."
US,86.0,22.0,High Valley,Brassfield,"This light-orange-colored wine has quite a bit of red wine character, from the raspberry aromas to rather meaty grapey flavors, smooth texture and medium to full body."
US,91.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style."
France,92.0,120.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"This wine has the classic richness of Pinot Noir, with a touch of textured tannin and bright red fruits. It needs more bottle age, so drink this wine from 2017. This is one of three Champagnes in a series of limited releases named after Dumangin ancestors (Hippolyte was the first to make Champagne)."
US,92.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"With residual sugar of 22.4%, this dessert wine has fantastically sweet flavors of apricot jam, tangerine marmalade, gingersnap cookie, vanilla and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, balanced with crisp acidity. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 9.8%."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Board Track Racer,"This Syrah/MourvÃ¨dre blend is a forward, bright and seamless expression of peppery berry fruit. Tart, smooth and accessible, it's backed with refreshing minerality and a dollop of cocoa."
US,87.0,15.0,Lodi,Caricature,"This wine struts the full oak treatment. It smells like vanilla, toasted bread and cherry syrup, and tastes almost like cherry pie. It may be technically dry, but it seems sweet with all its baking spice and ripe fruit characters."
US,90.0,25.0,Red Mountain,McCrea,"Pale yellow in color, this five-plus-year-old white has aromas of lees, dried apricot and flowers. The palate feels full bodied, but with lighter-styled flavors and a zing of acid on the finish."
France,84.0,13.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,Louis Bernard,"A broad, rather soft example of rosÃ©, this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan should be consumed over the next few months."
Spain,90.0,45.0,Rioja,Bodegas Riojanas,"Rusty and mature in color, with earthy, lightly leafy aromas that come with notes of maple and brown sugar. This feels elegant and fit, with classic Rioja flavors of dried red fruit, cocoa and malt. The finish is long and tasting lightly baked. Drink now."
France,89.0,32.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau LÃ©oube,"Complex and powerful, this wood-aged red has both elegance and density. Its black plum and blackberry fruits are spiced with an herbal character that gives an edge to the acidity in the aftertaste. Keep for 4?? years."
US,85.0,22.0,Rogue Valley,Valley View,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's lightly aromatic with notes of herbs and kiwi. The palate is medium-bodied with sweet tropical fruit flavors but the concentration doesn't seem there."
US,88.0,25.0,Monterey County,Concannon,"Grenache's main duty is to deliver cherry flavors, and this one over-performs in that category. It just brims with black and red cherries in their essence. The wine is dry and silky, even more light-bodied than some Pinot Noirs, and quite delicious in its own way. Drink now with a grilled steak and rosemary potatoes."
Italy,91.0,33.0,Alto Adige,Tramin,"Pinot Grigio doesn't get better than this. Fresh and fragrant, this lovely wine offers beautiful intensity and a soft, smooth consistency. Peach nectar, tangerine, lemon curd and white almond all appear in perfect doses."
US,88.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Swedish Hill,"Exuberant on the nose with aromas of ripe red cherries, peppery spices, herbs and just a touch of funky earth tones, there's a pleasurable rusticity to this Cabernet Franc. It's boldly structured with rich body and dense, drying tannins that hug the finish. It's lovely now, but should continue to evolve well over the next 3-5 years."
US,87.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Mount Eden Vineyards,"Great structure and balance, among the finest in the world, with all the pedigree that terroir brings to Cabernet. But vintage rules. This harvest, the wine is lean in fruit, with a pepper and sage profile."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Erice,Fazio,"Pretty aromas suggest ripe berry, spiced plum and a bit of eucalyptus. The polished palate offers mature blackberry and cinnamon alongside smooth but rather fleeting tannins."
France,90.0,21.0,Morgon,Vignerons de Bel Air,"From the slopes of CÃ´te de Py, this is a solid, powerful wine with dark tannins and a firm, still young structure. Cherry and plum fruits give weight. It's still developing, so don't drink before 2016."
US,86.0,13.0,Finger Lakes,Lamoreaux Landing,"Touches of vanilla, spice and smoked nuts lend complexity to straightforward apple, lemon and pear flavors in this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's refreshing and easy drinking with a brisk, clean finish."
France,95.0,34.0,Alsace,Trimbach,"Pure citrus zest rises from the glass: lovely, ripe lemon and zesty lime. The palate reinforces these flavors in a rapier-like fashion, with drive and energy in a very linear energetic way. This seem like an elixir or a tonic full of vim, all informed by a central dynamic freshness. This has barely blossomed but promises much future pleasure. This genie should be contained in its bottle for a while longer before letting it loose. It's something to look forward to. Drink 2020??035."
US,88.0,35.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Highland Oaks,"Prolific winemaker Andrew Murray crafted this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah for the Petras family, and it shows aromas of boysenberry, dark chocolate, coffee and dark licorice. The flavors are a bit wound up, dense yet not thick, with espresso and bitter chocolate most prevalent. This will improve with time."
Australia,91.0,19.0,Rutherglen,Campbells,"Delicately floral on the nose, this sweet but wonderfully balanced Muscat offers a fine introduction to the Rutherglen Muscat style. Pineapple, raisin and spice flavors persist a good long time, trailing elegantly away on the finish."
US,94.0,60.0,Santa Maria Valley,Byron,"It's impossible to imagine this wine could have existed even five years ago, even though it hails from the extraordinary Nielson Vineyard that for many years has yielded Byron's best Pinot Noirs, as well as Chardonnays. The ripeness level is something only modern techniques could achieve, and the 2007 vintage was great. Ultrarich in blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, the wine retains a silky texture and is imposingly full-bodied. Drink now??013."
US,93.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass."
France,91.0,18.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Clos Puy Arnaud,"This attractive, juicy wine is full of red fruit. It has strawberry and crisp red currant flavors as well as fine acidity. The result is a wine with good balance, richness, spice and tannins. Drink from 2019."
US,84.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Ca' Momi,"This wine has a smoky char quality and a decadent richness of cured meat and bacon grease. Light, it's dusted modestly in spice, with an herbaceous tease of tannin on the finish."
US,90.0,16.0,Amador County,Easton,"A first-class Zin that shows classic mountain character, at a very nice price. Dry and rich in tannins, it's explosive in briary, brambly wild berries, currants, dark chocolate and pepper, with a touch of raisins. Just delicious."
US,89.0,50.0,Sonoma Valley,Schug,"Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries."
US,89.0,24.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Andrew Rich,"A young, juicy, assertive Syrah that pits its blackberry and black cherry fruit against a strong streak of smoky licorice. The acids are still a little awkward, but time should help with that. Otherwise, it's got a lot of power and grace, with classic, tangy Washington berry flavors and pleasing hints of earth and leaf in the finish."
US,88.0,40.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Expression 44Â°,"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar."
US,90.0,60.0,Sonoma Valley,Ravenswood,"From a famed old site planted to 75% Zinfandel and 25% mixed black-skinned varieties, this wine conveys a minty-eucalyptus quality that tunes the acidity high against a medium-weight body. Austere at first on the palate, it expands as it goes, offering robust, dry tannins and layers of cardamom and coffee with time and air."
US,89.0,27.0,Russian River Valley,Fritz,"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure."
US,90.0,14.0,Mendocino County,Parducci,"Dark, rich and full bodied, this wine has great structure and bold, tasty flavors like boysenberry and blackberry. It feels firm and tannic on the palate, but without overdoing it. Generous fruit flavors linger on the finish."
US,90.0,28.0,California,Lusso Della Terra,"Brilliant pink with a touch of orange, this refreshing and light-bodied wine tastes fresh and strawberrylike. It has an appetizingly crisp texture and clean fruity finish."
US,88.0,17.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"This blend of 49% Roussanne, 36% Grenache Blanc and 15% Viognier hits the nose with lemon zest, cooked apples and a bit of banana. It's very fresh on the palate, with honeysuckle, green apples and a pear skin tension, enhanced with wisps of smokiness."
US,89.0,40.0,Central Coast,Dragonette,"This Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah blend contains a splash of Viognier. It's a good, interesting wine, with complex layers of ripe red cherries and red licorice, as well as notes of bacon, mocha and black pepper. With a rich, fruity finish, it doesn't seem like an ager, but is very good now, especially with spicy lamb or beef dishes."
France,86.0,17.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau La Rame,"This is a warm wine, ripe and with hints of yellow fruits as well as crisper acidity. Poised between herbal and riper flavors, it's ready to drink now."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Toscana,Poggiotondo,"A pure expression of Vermentino, this offers aromas of citrus, peach, dried hay and Golden Delicious apple. Pair this bright white with Thai dishes or spicy Indian food."
France,88.0,60.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"Dry and crisp, this bright, tight Champagne has citrus, red fruits and a strong steely character at its heart. The bottling tastes young, fresh and would benefit from some bottle age. Hold it until mid-2015."
US,83.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Armanino Family Cellars,"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry."
Argentina,93.0,115.0,Uco Valley,Mendel,"Smooth blackberry, chocolate, violet and raisin aromas make for a complete nose. A saturated, ripe palate is a touch heavy, while heady flavors of licorice, black peppercorn and blackberry are slightly charred on a flush finish. Drink through 2022."
US,94.0,56.0,Willamette Valley,Shea,"Here's a rich, full-bodied wine that rolls from the first floral sniff into a wellspring of deep, briary, berry-cherry fruit. Peppery spices and dried Mediterranean herbs meld on an endlessly fascinating finish that promises decades of development ahead."
US,91.0,35.0,Paso Robles,Turley,"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe?nearly overripe?with dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre."
US,88.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Silver Trident,"Soft and supple in lemon and melon, this 100% varietal white was given time in both stainless steel and neutral oak, the combination rewarding in a rounded, approachable mouthfeel that's both creamy and ripe. Stone fruit makes an appearance, before the wine finishes lean and tart."
Argentina,93.0,50.0,Agrelo,Finca Decero,"Smoky and dark, with serious aromas of black licorice, earth and lush berry. The palate has a great feel to it along with huge flavors of cassis, blackberry, black peppercorn, coffee and sweet coconut. It's stellar from front to back, with coffee, mocha and silky tannins on the finish. Composed of 60% Malbec with 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and small parts Tannat and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013."
US,84.0,20.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Firestone,"Simple and ripe, this wine highlights a fruity blend of pineapples, peaches and apricots, punched up with a warming touch of alcohol. Forward and easy drinking with a slightly cloying finish."
France,84.0,28.0,CrÃ©mant de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de Piote,Touches of red fruits give this soft and creamy wine attractive acidity. Pepper and spice lead to a bitter aftertaste.
Italy,87.0,30.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Grifalco,"New leather, moist soil, tobacco, coconut and balsamic aromas emerge on this medium-bodied red. The palate is rather lean, evoking prune, dried cherry and a hint of star anise alongside bright acidity and fleeting tannins."
US,85.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Rombauer,"The winery initially produced Cabernet, a fact fans of its white wines might not know. This vintage offers 83% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 11% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Puckering in tannin, it offers faint mint and high-toned black cherry, the finish ripe and vanilla-sweet."
US,89.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Graziano,"Refreshing and aromatic, this wine is 15% Tocai Friulano and has some good depth. Aromas like lemon and light herbs lead to deeper flavors that have a light buttery element as well as ripe apple and more crisp lemon on the finish."
France,94.0,314.0,LatriciÃ¨res-Chambertin,Domaine Faiveley,"This is a beautiful, ripe and floral wine. It does have structure although the main focus is on the rich, juicy fruit. Berries and red plums push through the rounded tannins. It will age magnificently, with great richness."
Canada,93.0,25.0,Beamsville Bench,Cave Spring,"Elegant and detailed, this is a dry, racy wine with well-balanced flavors of lemon, lime, citrus and mineral. It's quite fresh and perfectly proportioned, with exceptional length. Delicious already, it can easily age until 2025 and probably well beyond."
US,91.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"Sourced from a smorgasbord of AVAs, this well-crafted Cabernet includes small percentages of Merlot and Cab Franc. Hard, tight and firmly grounded in cassis and black fruits, it melds in streaks of mineral, graphite and a hint of herb."
US,91.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,Oak Knoll,"Delicate, but nicely concentrated, with flower and fruit nicely integrated. Meyer lemon, tangerine, pear and even a hint of candied papaya mingle beautifully, set in a fine-tuned frame of acid and mineral."
US,82.0,11.0,California,Tussock Jumper,"A basic Merlot, this shows brisk, candied cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors."
France,87.0,25.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau la Chapelle Despagnet,"One of the many chateaus with vines on the wide valley floor of the Dordogne, this estate has made a lightly extracted wine that has chocolate as well as blackberry stalkiness. There's freshness as well, with fruit acidity that cuts through the mineral texture. Drink from 2018."
France,90.0,35.0,Givry,Antonin Rodet,"Givry is one of the unsung values in Burgundy. This ripe and structured wine shows why. It has weight, a firm texture and red plum and strawberry fruit flavors. All these elements are held together by a dark sense of tannin and fine acidity."
Argentina,90.0,35.0,Uco Valley,Altocedro,"This oaky, creamy Malbec is one of Karim Mussi Saffie's trilogy of 2011 La Consulta single-vineyard varietals, and they are so similar in aromas, body weight, flavors and high oak levels that they are virtually interchangeable. Like its bretheren, this pours on the wood, vanilla, graphite, pencil eraser and resin along with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Maybe with time in the bottle it'll gain more individuality."
US,91.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Shane Wines,"Drenched in luxurious, almost sweet fruit flavors, this tempting and delicious wine is full bodied. Ripe in aromas and on the palate, it creates a vivid and warming cherry-pie effect on the senses, and is undeniably tasty."
Australia,95.0,125.0,Barossa Valley,Torbreck,"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now??030."
Spain,90.0,50.0,Rioja,RemÃ­rez de Ganuza,"This wine's rubbery latex, briary plum and berry aromas are potent. Its plum, berry and vanilla flavors finish with shrill acidity, hard, choppy tannins and long-lasting dark berry notes. Drink through 2028."
US,88.0,35.0,Livermore Valley,Longevity,"This combines fruity and savory aromas, with a rich but tannic texture and full body. Aroma recall black olive and cedar, while flavors focus on the fruit components. Everything is in place for an enjoyable, well-structured dinner wine."
US,90.0,24.0,Long Island,WÃ¶lffer,"This unusual rosÃ© blends Merlot rosÃ© with substantial portions of Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc and GewÃ¼rztraminer, highlighting textural and flavor attributes from each. It's luscious in mouthfeel with a dense concentration of tropical fruit flavors, yet brisk and effortlessly quaffable. A delightful new take on a Hamptons classic."
US,86.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,"Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah form the core of this wildly successful red blend from Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. Soft and juicy, it's packed with flavors of vanilla, pipe tobacco and cola, while keeping the stuffing and structure of a substantial wine. An appealing red blend, especially for consumers new to wine."
Spain,87.0,20.0,Priorat,Cesca Vicent,"Red plum and currant aromas are a touch soupy but also suggestive of cherry Kool-Aid. This Garnacha-led blend is clacky and fairly acidic on the palate, but then it turns on itself to show raisin, loam and baked plum flavors. A lively finish gives it a boost out the door."
France,94.0,100.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Domaines Devillard,"The Devillards own 99% of this 8.5-acre Premier Cru and so feel they can describe it as a quasi-monopoly. Vines dating back to 1922 give immense concentration as well as rich black fruits. The wine is spicy with a strongly mineral texture, red-berry fruits and black cherries. It is a wine for aging, so drink from 2022."
France,90.0,38.0,Corse,Clos Venturi,"This perfumed wine, with its lychee aromas, is full and rich. That aromatic character continues on the palate, giving rich spice and lychee flavors that are cut with just enough acidity. It's full bodied and ripe and will be ready to drink from 2018."
Spain,84.0,9.0,La Mancha,ViÃ±a San Juan,"This blend of Chardonnay, Viura and Verdejo is light in body, with stalky haystack aromas and dilute nectarine and melon flavors. Its yeasty finish is somewhat bland."
Spain,88.0,30.0,Navarra,Inurrieta,"After a whiff of iodine arises, the nose on this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers mostly jammy berry scents in front of a full palate containing zesty acidity. Flavors of red plum, salt, cherry and cranberry finish long and without any excess weight or push."
US,88.0,20.0,Wahluke Slope,Seven Falls,"Mocha, vanilla, woodspice and cherry aromas are at the front of this barrel-forward wine. Flavors display a mixture of fruit and barrel, with the latter winning out on the finish. The variety seems a bit lost but it provides plenty of pleasure."
US,87.0,22.0,Virginia,Fabbioli Cellars,"Notes of potpourri, pepper, dark cherry and raspberry are well established and alluring. It has an open-feeling core, with buffed tannins and a juicy, textured finish. 80% Cabernet Franc, plus 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Tannat and 5% Petit Verdot."
Spain,89.0,29.0,Costers del Segre,Mas Blanch I JovÃ©,"Oaky aromas of almond, vanilla and peach settle on a palate with grip and acidity. Flavors of toasted almond, baked apple and briny apricot finish with forward acidity. This is a blend of Garnacha Blanca and Macabeo, but it's the white Garnacha that sticks out."
US,86.0,49.0,Sonoma Valley,Ty Caton,"Tastes its best now, with jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, and a rich overlay of oak. The tannins and acids are soft and gentle."
France,91.0,27.0,Alsace,FrÃ©dÃ©ric Mallo,"Subdued but promising apple-ripeness on the nose leads to a rounded, fully mature palate that rings with fresh and dried apple. There are hints of hay and and a wonderfully, clean core of lemon freshness that is supremely well cushioned on these rich, intense flavors. Drink 2016??019."
Argentina,94.0,90.0,La Consulta,Zuccardi,"This pitch-dark, fully extracted Malbec from La Consulta in Mendoza's Uco Valley delivers blackberry, black pepper and brushy herbal aromas on what amounts to a massive, spot-on bouquet. Big, chewy and tannic on the palate, with earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry, prune, savory spices and raw oak, this finishes meaty, slightly salty and strong, with wild herb and black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022."
US,87.0,35.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"More like the 2000 than the richer '97 or '99, J. Lohr's 2005 Hilltop Cab is very fruity, but a little too soft. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spicy plum flavors have a melted quality. Drink soon."
US,90.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bontzu,"The aromas are alluring, with notes of stem, dried herb, white pepper, cigar box and raspberry. The palate is chock-full of raspberry flavors that show a pleasing purity, and the finish lingers, showing just a touch of heat."
US,86.0,24.0,Russian River Valley,Y Rousseau,"Sourced from Saralee's Vineyard-Matthew Station, it offers indelible savory and herbal notes, a chewy sense of wild strawberry and a drying finish for a curious, more thirst-quenching take on Tannat."
Italy,85.0,60.0,Chianti Classico,Villa Calcinaia,"This opens with aromas that recall moist underbrush, grilled sage, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor. The brisk, diluted palate offers raw red cherry, oak and a hint of star anise alongside stinging acidity and astringent tannins that leave a raspy finish. It lacks fruit richness."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Barolo,Marziano Abbona,"This is an especially delicious Barolo that relies on dark concentration and impressive aromatic intensity to make its point. Balsam notes of cola and root beer are set against bright fruit and spice. The wine's solid structure is enhanced by a soft, velvety finish."
US,93.0,45.0,Green Valley,Freeman,"Butter, hazelnut and marzipan aromas give a lush first impression, and then vibrant lemon and green-apple acidity provides a firm, balancing effect. This bright-gold, full-bodied wine is concentrated, layered and deep, without being too rich or heavy. Subtle nuances of nutmeg and ginger add to its complexity on the finish."
Spain,83.0,16.0,Ribera del Duero,Felix Callejo,"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry. Tart on the finish, and a bit stemmy and sharp throughout."
Spain,83.0,19.0,EmpordÃ ,Castillo de Perelada,"An oddball blend of many grapes that offers a spicy oak cover and sweet, earthy notes from front to back. But it's hard as nails, with blazing acidity, the result of which is a clacky, rough wine. On the plus side it has interesting flavors with tobacco and citrus notes."
US,91.0,38.0,Temecula Valley,Robert Renzoni,"Brown spices of clove and nutmeg decorate the nose of this solid bottling that offers a bit of dried blueberry in the deep background. The palate's presentation is very elegant and mellow, with black plum and blackberry fruit well integrated into graphite minerality and dried sagebrush, leaving a touch of tannins in the mouth."
US,93.0,80.0,Red Mountain,Gorman,"Light purple in color, this aromatically appealing, fruit-forward wine has notes of dark plum, dried herbs and peppery spices along with a mocha top note. It's plump and velvety in feel, with concentrated yet lithe fruit flavors that linger effortlessly on the long, fruit-filled finish that kicks it up a notch."
France,86.0,20.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Fantou,"This spicy wine with its aromatic character is fruity while also having some structure. The 90% Malbec/10% Merlot blend has a dry core, juicy red currant fruits and considerable acidity. With only a minimum of wood aging, it is ready to drink."
Italy,84.0,20.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,Monte Santoccio,"Prune, grilled herb and a whiff of salted-game aromas carry over to the light-bodied palate along with dried black cherry and a hint of clove. It's Ã¼ber-simple, with loose fleeting tannins."
US,93.0,115.0,Napa Valley,Jarvis,"Dark gold in color, this decadent wine is robust in toasted chestnut and hazelnut layers which are rich and powerful on the seamless palate. The oak shows prominently on the nose and palate but finds its balance on the finish, allowing the wine to end with polish and reserve."
Italy,92.0,29.0,Soave Classico,Gini,"This enticingly fragrant wine offers scents of white spring flower, apple, ginger and flint. On the elegantly structured palate, radiant acidity underscores crisp apple, Bosc pear, white peach and lemon drop, while a salty mineral note closes the tangy finish. It's an impressive effort for what was overall a washout vintage. Drink through 2024."
US,83.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Rezonja,"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend is harsh and tannic, with baked berry and currant flavors. May be technically dry, but tastes sugary sweet."
US,90.0,135.0,Napa Valley,Pont de Chevalier,"The pedigree of the vineyard shows in this Cab. It's as intensely ripe as Cabernet gets, with a massive core of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and chocolate, enriched with sweet new oak. But it's so balanced in tannins and acidity that it never feels over-the-top. The alcohol is quite high, though, which may limit ageability."
US,88.0,30.0,Chalk Hill,Reaper,"Despite the grim reference to the hooded guy with the scythe, this is a lively Cabernet, that's rich and tasty in flavor. At nearly four years of age, it's ready to drink now, with soft tannins framing blackberry, mocha and oak flavors."
Argentina,87.0,13.0,Salta,Ruca Malen,"Zesty, tropical aromas are clean and approachable. This is a patio wine with juicy grapefruit and lime flavors. Lean notes of citrus grace a sharp, pointed finish."
France,91.0,27.0,Moulin-Ã -Vent,Georges Duboeuf,"This has the structure expected from a wine in Moulin-Ã -Vent. It is dense, with a dry, dark core of tannins. The acidity, red plums and black-currant fruit characteristics give the potential for freshness along with a ripe future. Drink from 2017."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Sicilia,Fazio,"This easygoing red opens with fruity aromas of plum, wild berry and a whiff of violet. The informal palate offers red cherry, pomegranate and a hint of clove alongside round, rather fleeting tannins."
US,89.0,19.0,Yolo County,Midsummer Cellars,"A bright pink color and absolutely fresh grapefruit aromas suggest a crisp and lively wine, and that's what this 88% Grenache and 12% Viognier delivers. The flavors are quite dry but vivid, like lemon, tart cherry and ruby grapefruit. The texture is lean, the body is not heavy and the finish is tangy."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Romagna,CondÃ©,"Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this opens with aromas of French oak, blackberry, coconut and a whiff of dark spice. The medium-bodied palate doles out plum, roasted coffee bean and a hint of licorice alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2019."
US,92.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"From a steep hillside vineyard that is estate owned and farmed, this wine is pungent in dark fruit and black tea. Elusive at first, it takes time to open and reveal classic Sebastopol Hills elements of earth and black cherry, finishing awash in cardamon."
Spain,91.0,27.0,Priorat,Celler Pasanau,"Thick, raisiny berry aromas come with notes of licorice, mineral and black peppercorn. Feels tight and juicy, with zesty red fruit flavors, sweet black fruit flavors and shadings of schisty minerality and licorice. Smooth and sturdy on the finish."
US,90.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Della,"This balanced and fuller style of Pinot Noir celebrates the classic traits of Russian River's warmer pockets. It offers plenty of dark fruit, from blackberry to raspberry and black cherry, with sultry, fine-hewn tannins and juicy texture."
US,89.0,12.0,California,Montevina,"A wonderful creamy texture accompanies ripe cherry and blackberry flavors in this full-bodied, smooth and mellow wine. Rich cherry and cappucino flavors fill the corners of the mouth, mingling with a velvety layer of fine tannins."
Italy,95.0,61.0,Barolo,Paolo Scavino,"What a fabulous vintage for this fragrant, radiant wine. Opening with alluring scents of iris, rose, culinary spice and perfumed berry, the focused palate delivers crushed strawberry, red cherry, cinnamon and star anise. It's loaded with finesse, thanks to firm ultrarefined tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2022??033."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Etna,Cantine Russo,"Aromas of moist underbrush, saddle leather, dried herb, menthol and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco while close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink."
US,88.0,47.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reininger,"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Pepper Bridge and XL vineyards. It offers intriguing aromas of sandalwood, rose petal, wood spice and black currant, with the oak a bit out front. The dark-fruit flavors are reserved in style, tapering toward the finish."
US,86.0,14.0,North Coast,Murphy-Goode,"An easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc thats fermented in barrel and stainless steel, this has a depth of pear, tangerine and lime flavors. Creamy and rich, it will make a consistent companion to most fish dishes."
US,94.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Kiona,"Kiona's ice wines are legendary, and this latest is as excellent as any they've done. Butterscotch scents invite further exploration. As the wine coats the mouth, it comes into lush focus with brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, cooked banana and more butterscotch. It's low in alcohol, but maintains sufficient acidity to stay buoyant and lively. Residual sugar is a hefty 170 g/L."
US,92.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Domaine Eden,"Grapefruit rind, yogurt, sour cream and warm pear show on the nose of this bottling. There is great acidity on the sip, with a mango cream and tropical fruit touch, but those elements coalesce into a rich, roasted-almond-driven palate as the wine breathes."
Italy,88.0,75.0,Franciacorta,Fratelli Berlucchi,"This opens with aromas of bread crust, ripe orchard fruit and a citrusy note. The creamy palate offers baked yellow apple, vanilla and toasted hazelnut alongside a soft perlage."
France,90.0,21.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau de ParenchÃ¨re,"While there are strong wood flavors here, the wine also has a good rich weight from the blackberry fruits. It is a concentrated wine with spice and some dry tannins that will integrate well. Drink this fine wine from 2018."
Spain,93.0,27.0,Toro,Abelis Carthago,"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared."
US,88.0,28.0,Santa Maria Valley,Highflyer,"This Chardonnay is rich and decadent with plenty of ripe fruit and oak. It's a crowd pleaser with flavors of mangoes, pineapples, limes, buttered toast and vanilla, all brightened by acidity."
US,93.0,70.0,Howell Mountain,W.H. Smith,"This is a lovely wine, classically rendered in cedar, herb and red cherry. The dried herb and forest floor elements persist on the palate, with bursts of acidity giving it life and lingering persistence, the tannins well-integrated."
Italy,89.0,39.0,Alto Adige,Tenuta Peter SÃ¶lva & SÃ¶hne,"Delicately scented, this offers aromas suggesting hay, elderflower and a whiff of exotic fruit. The elegantly structured palate delivers gooseberry, grapefruit, kiwi and mineral framed in lively acidity."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Montecariano,"Braised lamb shanks or cotechino sausage with lentils are two pairing possibilities for this dense wine. It has a bright touch of acidity that would clean the palate of those rich foods. The aromas of red cherry and tobacco are present, but won't overwhelm the food."
US,92.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,De Loach,"Fantastically bright acidity defines this wine, the winery's ?finest selection,??which is memorable for its crisp black cherry and strawberry core of fruit. Voluptuous and silky on the palate, it carries a hint of Asian spice throughout, the slightest taste of wild vanilla wrapping things up on the finish."
US,90.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Baer,"A lighter Ursa than recent vintages, the 2009 is a young purple-violet color, with grapy aromas and a broad, fruity palate. Hints of roasted nuts express barrel aging, and the wine has good grip, though the fruit flavors at this stage are still primary. Give this one some further bottle age to smooth out."
US,85.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,River Road,"Sparkling wine is all about texture, and the mouthfeel on this Chardonnay-based bubbly lacks refinement. The bubbles are scoury and the finish is rough. Still, it has rich citrus, yeast, honey and pear flavors."
Italy,94.0,60.0,Etna,Pietro Caciorgna,"Here's a surprise from Mt. Etna that blew us away. Made by Pietro Caciorgna, this is a delicate and linear wine with pristine aromas of blue flower, delicate forest fruit and black stone. It represents the best of elegant winemaking with that unmistakable blast of volcanic power at the rear."
Argentina,91.0,20.0,Mendoza,Zuccardi,"A home run in middle-tier Malbec. Excellent power and balance are on display. It's firm, minerally and tight, but with generous berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with ample coffee, spice and mocha qualities. Impressive, especially given the price tag; drink now through 2014."
France,90.0,36.0,Puisseguin Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Langlais,"The vineyard surrounds a 14th century castle, built by the English. The wine from organically grown grapes, is rich and full. Still with some tannins while also with rich black fruits, it is structured, ripe and generous. The wine is ready to drink, although keeping it until 2017 will make it even better."
US,91.0,60.0,Dundee Hills,Sokol Blosser,"Though replanted, the vines designated for this bottling were taken from cuttings of the original vineyard blocks dating back to the early 1970s. Pretty in color, aroma and overall balance, this offers substantial black cherry fruit at its core, buttressed with barrel flavors of cacao. The wine shows good penetration and power, helped by aging 16 months in 38% new barrels."
Spain,85.0,15.0,Montsant,Tossals,"A vibrant purple color and foxy berry aromas announce the jammy palate and punchy acidity of this wine. It tastes of herbal plums and berries and doesn't hold up on the oaky, pulpy finish."
US,90.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Merry Edwards,"Sourced from six different vineyards, this is a broadly pleasing wine, fruity in blackberry and raspberry that veers even into cranberry and cassis territory without getting bogged down. Substantial and lush, it's tightly woven in tannin and savory herb, ready to open itself over time. Patience will reward with more exotic interweavings of vanilla-cola and tea."
Italy,86.0,10.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Talamonti,"Here's a terrific value wine that would pair with ground beef, grilled sausage or oven-baked lasagna with meat sauce. The wine has a dark, concentrated color, and it opens with generous aromas of black berry and tobacco."
France,86.0,9.0,Vin de Pays de L'Herault,Moulin de Gassac,"A crisp, fresh, intensely dry wine that is balanced by some ripe caramel and red currant flavors. This is a rosÃ© in the Provence tradition, dry, designed for food."
US,83.0,7.0,Monterey County,Hilltown,"Tastes semisweet, like a lemon, lime and pineapple cough drop. But the acidity is brisk and cleansing, and lots of people will enjoy this affordable wine."
US,90.0,62.0,Sonoma County,Passaggio,"The numbers represent the grapes within: 75% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot. High in acidity, it shows a crispness of red berry, its core juicy and easy to like. Integrated oak keeps things simple and round, with leather and tobacco poking their heads on the finish."
US,82.0,18.0,Livermore Valley,Cedar Mountain,"A bizarre wine weird-aromas and flavors. Smells smoky-sweet, like cotton candy, with mint and peach puree, and has similar flavors. Hard to tell if it's dry or sweet."
US,83.0,26.0,Alexander Valley,Antic,"An 84% Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, it reveals a plethora of oak nestled around dried cranberry, bittersweet chocolate and cigar. Medium bodied, it benefits from additional time in the glass."
France,84.0,10.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Clerget,"Red fruits dominate this wine, which features medium body and minimal tannin. A hint of nail polish intrudes on the nose of cherries and red raspberries, but the wine finishes with a fine, silky feel. Drink now."
France,95.0,46.0,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,"Subtle notes of earth mix with summer blossom, along with hints of honey, quince and zesty, fresh lemon peel. These aromas dance and take turns on the dry, balanced palate that shines both with rich fruit and slender tone. Lemony freshness pervades everything with its brightness. This is lovely now but will be even lovelier over the years. Drink 2016??030."
US,88.0,17.0,Edna Valley,Tangent,"This region is known for producing lean whites from grapes that tend to be blousy in warmer zones, and this bottling is no exception. It shows crushed chalk, pomelo and gardenia aromas on the nose and is tense on the palate, its grippy white rock flavors accented with Granny Smith apple notes."
Argentina,80.0,15.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Staphyle,"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive."
France,85.0,8.0,Vin de Pays des CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Producteurs Plaimont,"Fragrant and floral, this is a deliciously easy wine, a blend of the local Gascon Colombard grape with Ugni Blanc. There are flavors of grapefruit, white fruits and a light, crisp green aftertaste. Screwcap."
US,91.0,22.0,Napa Valley,Silverado,"The 2009 vintage was a great one for this bottling, which was too sweet in 2008. This one's more like the '05, only richer and better. It feels nice and crisp and dry, with polished, complex citrus fruit, white flower, peach and mineral flavors."
France,91.0,24.0,Alsace,Domaine Schoffit,"Honeysuckle richness and lemon freshness vie for attention on the nose. The palate comes in with lots of concentration and very pithy, almost bitter texture as well as residual sweetness. Together they create balance and a very intense tangy finish and leave a lasting impression."
France,93.0,95.0,Condrieu,Michel & StÃ©phane Ogier,"Like the rest of the 2012 Condrieus recently tasted, this is full-bodied and rich without being overdone. Apricot and ginger aromas lead into flavors reminiscent of honeycomb, white pepper and apricot. The texture is slightly oily, but that's balanced on the finish by peppery spice."
US,92.0,24.0,Sonoma County,Lambert Bridge,"Seems very oaky, with in-your-face aromas of vanilla, char and pepper, but the fruit is able to support it. In fact, the underlying flavors are rich and gorgeous. It shows Cabernet's cassis and blackberry aromatics, with the soft tannins and velvety, drink-me-now texture of Merlot."
US,90.0,45.0,Sonoma County,Kendall-Jackson,"Big mountain fruit here throws powerful aromas of ripe plum, thyme and bacon, while full-scale oaking yields maple aromas, vanilla flavors, and coffee on the finish. The wood element is a little weighty at this point, but there's solid fruit to support it."
US,95.0,52.0,Sonoma Coast,Failla,"This is one of Failla's riper, fruitier 2012 Pinots. Classic Sonoma Coast Pinot, with brisk acidity and complex flavors, it shows wild raspberry, cherry and blueberry fruits, persimmons, cola, and earthier notes of sautÃ©ed wild mushrooms and truffles. It's dry, tannic and tart, but as good as it is now, it will improve by resting until 2020."
US,90.0,24.0,Ribbon Ridge,Chehalem,"This is dry, crisp and nicely detailed, with a persistent, clean and fresh mouthfeel. Notes of cucumber, salad greens and citrus, notably lime and grapefruit, are underscored with appealing minerality. This remains one of the highlights of Chehalem's expansive portfolio."
France,87.0,22.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"This brand new, crisp and fresh wine is so young. Even a rosÃ© can benefit from a few months aging, and this wine with its tight red fruits and lightly tannic texture will be better being drunk after the summer when its fruitiness will explode in the mouth. It is ripe, light and packed with acidity at the end."
Italy,91.0,35.0,Bolgheri Superiore,Ferrari Iris e Figli,"This 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc shows a bright cherry aroma, with spice, leather and tar notes in the background. It shows a soft, plush feel, with good balance."
Australia,87.0,18.0,Barossa Valley,Lambert,"Medium to full in weight and opulent in texture, this is a buttery creamy wine that reflects its South Australian origin. Broad and rich, it's a throwback to a previous generation's style of Chardonnay."
US,90.0,25.0,Red Hills Lake County,Chacewater,"Dark color and black fruit aromas set the expectation for a big wine, but this is remarkably well-balanced, poised and smooth. Its black cherry and blackberry flavors are satifying, dry and not overripe, and its hints of cocoa add delicious complexity."
US,90.0,30.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"Stoller offers fine value across its entire portfolio. This is solidly crafted and estate-grown, from the heart of the Dundee Hills AVA. There's a gentle touch of new oak, among a flavorful mix of strawberries, cherries and oranges. The moderate alcohol signals a balanced wine with ample acidity. Drink now through 2022."
Spain,93.0,89.0,Rioja,RemÃ­rez de Ganuza,"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016."
US,89.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Wondrous,"Primarily Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this wine opens with aromas of dried herb and blue and black fruit, along with a toasty top note. The flavors show restraint, with firm tannins backing them up. The concentration isn't all there in the middle but there's still much to enjoy."
US,83.0,11.0,Paso Robles,Rubberneck,"Robust and fleshy, this is soft, easy and slightly sweet. It has pie-filling flavors of blackberries and peppery spices."
Italy,91.0,110.0,Toscana,Tenuta Sette Cieli,"Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of blueberry, cedar and a whiff of rosemary. The juicy polished palate offers red currant, raspberry and Mediterranean herb. It closes on a vanilla note. Drink through 2022."
US,82.0,7.0,California,Glen Ellen,"Has slight but clean wildflower and peach aromas, and drinks light but fruity, with apple and peach notes. Seems a little off-dry, but with adequate acidity. Nothing wrong with this low-priced, everyday-style wine."
France,92.0,160.0,Champagne,Ayala,"Just slightly richer than the Brut Nature from the same vintage, this Brut is still a wonderfully dry Champagne. It has a fine hint of toasty maturity while the fruit is still full of the crispest citrus flavors. Drink over the next 4?? years."
Italy,89.0,46.0,Toscana,Cafaggio,"Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with subdued aromas of ripe plum and vanilla. The aromas carry through to the robust palate, together with tobacco and clove. Round tannins provide soft support. Drink through 2019."
US,88.0,15.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes. The wine shows subtle oak notes, but is mainly notable for its forward flavors, elegant dryness and crisply bright acidity."
US,93.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Four Cairn,"A dramatically rich Syrah made along Northern RhÃ´ne lines. Dry, full-bodied and tannic, its flavors now are primary and fresh, suggesting summer blackberries, a few of them shriveled into raisins, and the whole sprinkled with cassis and black pepper. Needs time. Better after 2013."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Alto Adige,Tramin,"Tramin presents this fresh, easy-drinking Chardonnay that boasts coolclimate aromas of stone fruit, white flower and citrus. It's zesty and clean in the mouth and perfect for seafood salad."
US,88.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Bucher,"This is the producer's first barrel-aged Chardonnay, made from a blend of two vineyards and two clones, including one from their own estate on Westside Road. Sour and sweet alternatively, it finds a steely path to balance and soft layers of apple, Asian pear and a touch of ginger-topped butterscotch."
Italy,94.0,100.0,Barolo,Castello di Verduno,"Powerfully built, this opens with a potpourri of aromas including pressed rose, violet, mature berry, baking spice and a whiff of leather. Dried black cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco, nutmeg and a balsamic note wrap around the gripping palate alongside a backbone of ripe, assertive tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020??032."
US,89.0,25.0,Anderson Valley,V. Sattui,"Aromas like melon and almond, then flavors like peach and honey make a sophisticated blend in this dry, light-bodied wine. It has vibrant acidity for good balance and richness in texture that lingers on the finish. The name refers to the egg-shaped concrete vats used for fermentation."
US,93.0,35.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"Crafted from estate-grown Dijon clones, this outstanding effort offers sophisticated flavors of pear, quince, ginger and lemon curd, wrapped together in a buttered-nut finish. Barrel fermentation helps smooth the way into a beautifully balanced, ageworthy style."
US,89.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"The blend here is two-thirds Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc. Tight and toasty, it carries a hint of green tannins that show up in an astringent, lightly chalky finish. The fruit is sharp and herbal, with a suggestion of heat."
US,86.0,23.0,San Benito County,Manzoni,"Dark mauve in color, nearly approaching a red-wine tone, this shows a fruit-forward nose of red cherries and strawberry jam. The palate is a mix of tart, sour and grippy texture, with cherry fruit and plum-skin flavors."
US,82.0,26.0,Central Coast,Calcareous,"Overripe, with apricot and pear flavors, although it's dry. The wine feels heavy and syrupy in the mouth, lacking vibrancy."
France,84.0,20.0,Bordeaux,Vinum Natura,"A balanced wine, showing attractive fruitiness, ripe black currants and soft tannins. It's likely to be ready to drink soon."
France,86.0,20.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine du Chalet Pouilly,"Full and soft, this is a ripe and creamy wine, with generous melon and rich apple fruits. It is already delicious, though simple."
US,95.0,35.0,Spring Mountain District,Galerie,"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot?it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish."
France,87.0,35.0,Mercurey,Domaines Devillard,"Fresh, soft and fruity, this is brightened by a jammy red-fruit flavor and light acidity. It has a juicy character, with underlying attractive, gentle tannins."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Collio,Venica & Venica,"Aromas of acacia, nut and yellow stone fruit lead the nose. It's ripe and round, offering dried apricot, bread crust, golden apple and a note of bitter almond."
US,88.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Benton-Lane,"Barrel-fermented and aged in 15% new French oak, this is Pinot Blanc done in a Chardonnay style. Buttery and toasty, with light Asian pear and green apple fruit, it's balanced and drinking nicely, best for near-term consumption."
US,85.0,20.0,Carneros,Artesa,"Forward fruit and oak flavors mark this clean, swift Chardonnay. The palate boasts apricot, papaya and buttered toast flavors, balanced with crisp acidity."
Italy,90.0,55.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Le Ragose,"Dried plum, grilled bell pepper, exotic spice, chocolate and savory herb aromas waft out of the glass. The structured palate delivers prune, graphite, licorice and tobacco alongside big but polished tannins. It has a succulent finish, closing on a mineral note."
US,93.0,40.0,Lake County,Langtry,"Easily the best Merlot in memory from Lake County, this one stands next to anything from Napa Valley, which is just over the hill from the vineyard. Shows a gorgeous tannin structure, with ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, green olives and cedar."
US,87.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Sonnet,"A lighter-style Pinot, in both mouthfeel and flavor. Silky and gentle in the mouth, it has pleasant flavors of cherry and raspberry pie filling, sprinkled with anise, cinnamon, ground cloves, pepper, orange zest and vanilla."
France,88.0,26.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Greysac,"While this is a firm wine, full of dry tannins and smoky wood-aging flavors, it also has plenty of ripe and juicy fruit. Red berry and black currant show strongly, filling the wine out and promising roundness as it ages. Drink from 2017."
US,91.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"A Bordeaux blend of five grapes, this melds blackberry and black cherry fruit with plenty of toasty oak and ground coffee. It's a nice mix of fruit and barrel, dark and smoky, but not too heavy at 14.2% alcohol."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Degani,"Ripasso Cicilio shines bright with personality and freshness. This territory-driven wine boasts clean aromas of berry fruit, light shadings of spice and a touch of sweet cinnamon. It's easy, crisp mouthfeel washes clean over the palate."
US,86.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Rancho Sisquoc,"Dense blueberry, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling of a fairly rare grape in the region. The palate intrigues with tar, beef crust and tart, tannic elderberry fruit, but it's quite wound up in a very solid structure that still needs time to unwind."
US,85.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Roblar,"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah is fairly weak on the nose, with black cherry, dark spice and crushed rocks emerging with steady swirling. Purple fruits and graphite minerality show up on the palate, but this wine still needs time to come out of its shell."
US,93.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Monticello Vineyards,"A selection of the better barrels from the Home Ranch, the Reserve is fantastically rich and complex. No mere fruit bomb despite scads of flavors ranging from apples and peaches through pears and mangoes, there's also a sleek backbone of steel, all of it wrapped in a rich, honeyed texture. The finish is long and intricately constructed of dusty brown spices."
US,93.0,150.0,Howell Mountain,Arcudi,"From a 2,400-foot elevation vineyard, this wine is unexpectedly elegant and definitively age-worthy. Floral and unusual, the palate brings integrated tannins wrapped around a core of ripe blackberry and cassis. Structured, it has plenty of body and length, bringing an old world sensibility to new world fruit. Drink now through 2022."
US,93.0,45.0,St. Helena,David Fulton,"Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a ?Pet??fan, this is the one to buy."
US,84.0,40.0,Spring Mountain District,Terra Valentine,"There's a vegetable aroma in this wine, not exactly herbs, more like asparagus. In the mouth, the Cab tastes soft, sweet and candied. Average at best, and not an ager."
France,91.0,18.0,Alsace,Cave Freudenreich,"Just off dry, this is a rounded soft wine that takes its name after the sun god Apollo from the sunny exposure of the vineyard. It has a rounded, generous feel as a foil to its more steely, crisp character. A wine that certainly needs aging for 3?? years."
US,92.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,David Bruce,"Spicy cardamom adds to the exotic perfume that opens this wine that is juicy in acidity and bright with crisp red cherry. Refreshing, it takes on more weight and substance as it glides effortlessly to the finish."
US,89.0,32.0,Carneros,Signorello,"Screams Carneros. Fleshy, jammy fruit flavors of cherries, strawberries and raspberries are highlighted by good acidity and drink very dry, with soft but complex tannins. It's not a simple wine, and has enough stuffing to cellar for a few years."
Italy,93.0,38.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Cantina Fratelli Pardi,"Crushed black raspberry, plum, clove and white pepper are among the inviting aromas of this bold wine. The richly textured palate offers blackberry, mature cherry, black pepper and baking spice. Thanks to smooth, velvety tannins, it seamlessly combines power and grace. Drink 2016??022."
US,87.0,67.0,Paso Robles,Silver Horse,"Soft, lush and ripe, this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend has extracted black currant, blackberry jam, mocha and oak flavors, with a hint of maple syrup. It's ready to drink now."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Puglia,MatanÃ©,"This wine from southern Italy shows notes of ripe cherry, prune, cinnamon and leather. The mouthfeel is soft and seemingly sweet, making this an excellent pairing partner to tomato-based pasta sauces."
US,84.0,100.0,Napa Valley,Madrigal,An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.
France,92.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine Michel Fonne,"Flavors of pear peel and tart citrus zest on the nose lead to a slightly spicy palate. Floral notes hover above everything, and mouthwatering freshness and appetizing bitterness around the edges gets all juices flowing. While there is texture there is no heaviness. It's a very appetizing, just off-dry wine with gentle subtlety."
US,85.0,21.0,Sonoma County,Murphy-Goode,"Put some meat on the grill, slather it with barbecue sauce, and enjoy with this spicy Zin. Medium-bodied, it doesn't overwhelm the food but complements it, with dry, classically varietal flavors of wild berries, brambly herbs, white pepper and sandalwood."
US,87.0,12.0,Yakima Valley,Lone Birch,Aromas of red apple and spice lead to rounded fruit flavors that provide easy-drinking appeal. It's a well-priced spot-on example of the variety.
France,87.0,16.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Haut Gaudin,"With a fine spicy character, the wine from this estate is richly endowed with blackberry fruits as well as a firmly tannic core. There is no wood aging but the fruit gives the wine an approachable character. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,36.0,Anderson Valley,Fulcrum,"This smooth, tasty, very well-balanced wine glides over the palate and tastes like Bing cherry spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Fresh acidity and fine, firm tannins support the flavors well and keep the wine appetizing and mouthwatering, even in the aftertaste."
US,91.0,38.0,Arroyo Seco,Mesa Del Sol,"A leathery touch of teriyaki and beef char mesh with violet, blueberry and black cassis aromas on the nose of this bottling from deep in the canyons of this appellation. Dark fruits of blueberry and elderberry hang from a strong, cedar-driven tannic structure spiced with vanilla, maple and clove."
Argentina,83.0,24.0,Tupungato,Atipax,"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish."
US,94.0,50.0,Amador County,Renwood,"This wine is a classic of the type that can only improve with time. The aromas show tightly packed spices, superripe fruit and cedar. Dense blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors fill this full-bodied and lavishly tannic wine to the brim. The color is black, except for a slim ring of deep ruby at the edge. Best after 2025."
US,85.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Blackstone,"A good everyday Cabernet with some aspirations to quality. Even though it's a little rugged and harsh in tannins, it's dry, with oak-inspired flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and herbs. Drink now."
US,93.0,50.0,Santa Maria Valley,Mattina Fiore,"Cola, beef jerky, roasted meats and dried purple berries hit initially the nose, follow by aromatic woods and black pepper. The flavors are distinctly interesting, with sandalwood, stewed plums, peppered chocolate, soy-braised beef and a tiny bit of reductive tar."
US,88.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Bjornstad,"Strong in flavor, showing the ripeness and crispness of all Bjornstad's Chardonnays, with lemondrop, lime tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Very good, but doesn't quite have the elegance and refinement of the vineyard bottlings."
US,89.0,20.0,Amador County,Renwood,"Very fruity and fresh but also smooth and supple, this full-bodied wine smells like ripe raspberries. Likewise, tastes recall raspberries and red cherries. and feel firm and grippy enough to counterbalance the ripeness and body. It's a very sleek but very big mouthful."
Spain,84.0,8.0,Rioja,J. Garcia Carrion,"Slightly candied red fruit aromas bring a touch of herbal to the show, and the feel and flavor profile are equally tangy, zesty, lean and edgy. Red fruits are what it's about, and palate cleansing potential is its best attribute."
US,86.0,26.0,Sonoma County,Blanchard Family,"The burn of alcohol and natural black pepper spice give this wine a sting. Based on Grenache and Sangiovese, with some Zinfandel, it's rich in black and red currant and cola flavors."
US,85.0,41.0,Paso Robles,Cinquain,"An intensely fruit-driven Syrah marked by jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, pepper and melted milk chocolate. Delicious and unidimensional."
France,94.0,28.0,Alsace,Domaine BarmÃ¨s-Buecher,"Yeasty funk still obscures the aromas on the nose. The palate, however, speaks of fluid freshness, of richness and power channelled into precision and softness. The palate is bone dry and we can thus witness the brightness of the fresh acidity counteract masterfully with the richness of a balm-like textured body, leaving a streamlined and elegant Pinot Gris. The length just gets you."
US,89.0,65.0,Red Mountain,Fidelitas,"Coming from one of the state's premier vineyards, barrel-spice aromas are at the fore on first pour, with black-fruit and herb notes far in the background. The dark-fruit flavors are concentrated initially, tapering slightly toward the finish."
Spain,89.0,22.0,Cava,Alta Alella,"Pale salmon in color, this Brut Nature leads with clean, stony aromas that are more neutral than expressive. It's fresh, crisp and tight on the palate, with light, dry currant and raspberry flavors that feel clean on the finish."
Italy,94.0,106.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Cesari,"Amarone Bosan is a terrifically impressive wine with beautiful tones of polished river stone, savory spice, plum cake, root beer and liquid smoke. Sweet cherry and blackberry flavors are folded within the wine's rich texture and dense concentration. You'll love it."
Spain,91.0,24.0,Rioja,PeÃ±agudo,"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years."
US,88.0,38.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cinnabar,"With a buttery, creamy texture, this Chardonnay has oak-inspired flavors of Meyer lemons, sweet limes, honey, vanilla bean and buttered toast. The acidity is key, providing a central zest to the richness."
US,85.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"Almost as sweet as a dessert wine, with caramel, butterscotch and honey flavors riding over the underlying pineapple and peach notes. An enjoyable quaff."
France,87.0,18.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau du Caillau,"This big, firm wine offers serious tannins as well as rich blackberry fruits. It's a structured, dark wine, spicy from wood aging and ripely concentrated. Drink from 2017."
France,88.0,49.0,Alsace,Emile Beyer,"Crisp and fruity, this bright and fruity wine has attractive acidity as well as spice and a lightly tangy texture. It's still very fresh and needs time to deepen and become richer. Drink from 2016."
US,91.0,44.0,Carneros,Stemmler,"A new designation from the producer, made in tiny amounts, this wine is sourced from vines on the Donum Ranch property grafted to cuttings from the Ferguson Vineyard. Cardamom, dark plum and earthy black cherry mingle on the palate around medium-bodied, softly layered texture and a medium length. A persistence of savory black pepper and black olive tease on the finish."
US,88.0,45.0,Paso Robles,Treana,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend shows the ripe, exuberantly friendly type of red wine Paso Robles excels at. While it's filled with sweet cherries and currants, it has a good structure of acids and tannins for balance. The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine wears the heat well."
US,84.0,18.0,Sonoma-Mendocino,Angeline,"With grapes sourced 60% from Sonoma County and 40% from Mendocino County, this is a soft, floral wine with a bright finish. A sister brand made by Martin Ray, it's priced affordably and will offer a pleasant experience for most palates."
France,91.0,28.0,Sancerre,Gitton PÃ¨re et Fils,"Produced on flinty soil and aged in large wood barrels, this is a complex, rich wine. Ample apple and pear flavors are lifted by the smoky flavor and the concentration from aging on lees. The wine needs to age; drink from 2018."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Spain,Vicente Gandia,"Dry spice, saline and generic red-berry aromas make up the nose on this balanced yet familiar tasting Cabernet. Flavors of candied black plum and berry finish oaky, with cassis notes poking through. Overall this is fruity and fresh in style."
US,95.0,50.0,Stags Leap District,Pine Ridge,"Very solid and deep, with a bouquet of delicious black-currant and dark-cherry fruit and toasty, buttery oak. Very comfortable mouthfeel. Full, with layered fruit and a long and elegant finish that sports big but not sharp tannins. Tight now; hold for three to six years."
US,86.0,36.0,Santa Barbara County,Rusack,"This is a good wine, but it's not on a par with previous vintages, which probably was the result of the unusually cool summer. The wine tastes simple, with delicious but one-dimensional licorice, sweet, softened cola and blackberry jam flavors."
US,91.0,40.0,Central Coast,Bridlewood,"This wine, which is bolstered with 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Viognier, shows aromas of tar, charred beef and white pepper. That spice shows strongly on the vibrant palate, with crushed peppercorns dominating in a pleasant way, alongside black sage and other dark herbs."
France,87.0,15.0,Arbois,Michel Tissot,"This smooth and soft Chardonnay just hints at the oxidation found in the Vins Jaunes of Jura, giving it a full, ripe character with yellow fruits and a rounded texture. Produced by one of the many Tissots in Jura, across the valley from Burgundy, this rich wine is ready to drink."
Spain,84.0,20.0,Pago de ArÃ­nzano,ArÃ­nzano,"Mild citrus and stone-fruit aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This bright-pink rosÃ© is wide but citric on the palate, with mild nectarine and white-grape flavors. On the finish, this is round in feel without much flavor."
US,84.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Bianchi,"So ripe and fruity, it's almost too much of a good thing. Detonates on the palate with blasts of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola and cinnamon spice. Feels too soft, and could use greater dryness and structure, but it's a good BBQ sipper."
Italy,90.0,90.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fattoria dei Barbi,"This delivers a classic Sangiovese nose of wild cherry, leather, violet, iris, flint and spice. The dense palate reveals fleshy black cherry uplifted by menthol, eucalyptus, black pepper and sage. It's still young but should develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2016??023."
France,92.0,32.0,JuranÃ§on,ChÃ¢teau de Jurque,"Beginning to mature, this rich wine with its beautiful honey and spice flavors is, as always with Petit Manseng, finely balanced with acidity. The texture is smooth and opulent, its mango fruit cut with lemon-like tang. Drink from 2018."
US,86.0,55.0,Carneros,Nickel & Nickel,"This is a very ripe Chardonnay, with pineapple, orange and apricot jam flavors. It's rich but not particularly subtle, with lots of new French oak."
Italy,95.0,50.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Contucci,"Aromas of underbrush, pressed violet, blackberry, baked earth and new leather lead the nose of this classic wine. The structured, elegant palate offers succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove and a hint of anise alongside tightly knit but polished tannins that need to unwind. It's already tempting but give this time to develop even more omplexity. Drink 2017??030."
France,88.0,15.0,Bergerac Sec,ChÃ¢teau Tour des Gendres,"Powerfully rich, creamy wine that has considerable yellow fruit flavors to broaden the pear juice. The wine is ripe, full, while the acidity is just an afterthought."
US,85.0,18.0,San Antonio Valley,Swirl,"Dried, concentrated red fruit and raspberry syrup aromas combine for a delicious smelling nose on this wine from southern Monterey County, near Paso Robles. It is surprisingly thin and rough on the palate, with modest blueberry flavor and peppery spice."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Barbera d'Alba,Paolo Scavino,"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, blue flowers and a whiff of baking spices lead the nose on this vibrant red. The juicy palate doles out black cherry, red raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside vibrant acidity. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon."
US,94.0,48.0,McMinnville,Ayoub,"Matching tart red fruit to the vineyard's characteristic gun-metal minerality, the wine cloaks itself in a light coat of ash and stone. Crisp acidity puts a tight focus on the stylish, resonant finish. Delicious now, it's built to age. Drink now??030."
France,87.0,30.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Haut Lagrange,"This attractive and fruity wine is ready to drink now. It is bright with acidity, citrus and lively fresh-sliced apples. It's a delicious wine, all fruit with only the lightest texture. Ghislain Boutemy is the winemaker at the family estate."
US,87.0,27.0,Napa Valley,Charles Krug,"Made in a heavy, dense style, with extracted fruit flavors and lots of oak, this Cab is immediately flashy in chocolate, blackberry jam and toast. It delivers in richness, yet lacks a certain vitality. Drink now."
US,83.0,21.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Samson,"There's a hard edge to the mocha, herb and cherry aromas. The palate has blocky, dry tannins that distract."
US,94.0,90.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cayuse,"Beefy and broad, this offers up the aromas of a rich stew, with sweet tomato, peppery herb and game. Supple and soft, the flavors blend seamlessly, with the accent of savory notes rather than specific fruits."
US,87.0,21.0,Edna Valley,Wolff,"This has been a consistent bottling from Wolff. The '06 shows classic Edna Valley acidity and very ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, Key limes, papayas and mangoes. It finishes with rich honey, but the wine is thoroughly dry."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Eguren,"Generic plum and berry aromas are borderline volatile and include a forced note of chocolaty oak. This Tempranillo is abrupt and choppy on the palate, with flavors of candied plum and milk chocolate. A chocolaty oak character remains on a blocky finish."
US,85.0,12.0,Alexander Valley,ForestVille,"A Julia Roberts of a Merlot, pretty and innocent, maybe a little clueless. But who cares? It's fruity, dry, and fun, and even has some layers of complexity. Best of all, it doesn't cost too much. Drink up!"
Italy,94.0,105.0,Toscana,Marchesi Antinori,"Vibrant and loaded with finesse, this blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with enticing scents of red woodland berry, new leather, Asian spice and a touch of menthol. The youthful palate delivers red currant, wild cherry, star anise and clove alongside a backbone of firm acidity and polished, tightly wound tannins. It will age majestically; drink 2020??033."
US,88.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Treleaven,"Crisp lime acidity counters a sunny, lemon-cream disposition in this lusciously composed Chardonnay. The palate is silky in texture, lingering long and luxuriously on the finish."
Argentina,88.0,45.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Untamed and herbal on the bouquet, this has a coconutty sweetness that's offset by scratchy berry and grassy notes. It feels firm, with high acidity and tight tannins; the herbal flavors mingle with notes of sweet cassis and baked berry."
US,89.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bargetto,"Fairly sweet aromas of marzipan, honeysuckle, candied apricot and honeyed orange slices show on the nose of this bottling from a longtime winegrowing family in the Watsonville area. It's much tighter and brighter on the sip, with flavors of slightly sour green-pear skins and poached apple, and a touch of caramel on the finish."
Spain,89.0,20.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Valtea,"Lemony smelling but otherwise straightforward, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. Seems just creamy enough in the mouth, with mild citrusy acidity and normal, likable flavors of apple and orange. Uncomplicated, clean and ready to drink."
US,89.0,22.0,Finger Lakes,Bellwether,"Delicate swathes of honey brighten savory chestnut, smoke and mineral tones throughout this feather-light dry Riesling. It's an earthier slightly darker expression of Riesling with electric acidity accenting hints of spice and dusty pollen. The finish is long and intently smoky."
France,84.0,12.0,Alsace,Willm,"Not quite dry, this is a creamy apple-flavored wine. It is fresh, fruity and immediately attractive, with a light, fragrant aftertaste. Drink now."
Italy,84.0,18.0,Chianti Classico,Villa Vignamaggio,"This Sangiovese and Syrah blend opens with slightly burnt aromas of tar and campfire, and it has background notes of dried fruit and leather. It feels dry and a bit flat on the finish."
France,89.0,25.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"While herbaceous, this wine also has ripe tropical fruits that bring out a richer, early drinking side. It's bone-dry and crisp, the apricot fruits balanced by intense citrus. Concentrated and very fruity, it can be drunk now."
Argentina,90.0,29.0,Uco Valley,Finca Don Carlos,"This is heady and savory smelling, with a mild burnt-leaf component to the bouquet. The palate is stacked to the max, and dense in feel, with toast, espresso, hickory and baked berry flavors. On the finish, a hazelnut note blends with chocolate, licorice and toasted flavors."
France,86.0,15.0,Touraine,Domaine des Elephants,"Intensely herbal, this is a ripe, fresh and fruity wine. It has a grassy character that partners with tropical-fruit flavors. Drink now."
US,89.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Westerly,"Tremendous California richness in this Chardonnay. You can taste the sun in the ripe tropical fruit and peach flavors that are so pure and sweet tasting. Yet the acidity is brisk, and the finish is dry. Don't drink this complex wine too cold."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Alto Adige Terlano,Manincor,"Aromas of apple, spring flower, bread crust and crushed rock come together in the glass. The brisk palate offers unripe Kaiser pear, citrusy notes and mineral set against a backbone of racy acidity."
US,85.0,16.0,Knights Valley,Beringer,"This is a very fruity wine, one dominated by apple and peach and citrus flavors. Good acids make it bright, and it's impeccably clean and focused. Could use some more depth and layers. ?S.H."
France,89.0,26.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Hourbanon,"Aging in wood for 18 months has brought out the richness of this generous wine. It has black-currant acidity that is balanced by the tarry tannins and smoky character. Rich and now in equilibrium, this wine is ready to drink."
Spain,89.0,45.0,Alicante,Vinessens,"Plum and blueberry aromas display a hint of desert herbs. A full dense palate is jammy in feel, while blackberry and prune flavors come with herbal savory notes. A mix of toasty oak and prune-like flavors on the finish leave a lasting impression of maximum ripeness. Drink through 2021."
Australia,91.0,35.0,Yarra Valley,Yeringberg,"This is a nutty, toasty rendering of Chardonnay. Roasted cashew and cashew-butter notes frame subtle fruit elements reminiscent of white peach or pear. Despite a modest alcohol level, it's reasonably rich in feel and flavor, finishing with flavors of fresh pineapple."
US,84.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Souverain,"Strong, caramelized oak stars in this dry, rather one-dimensional Cabernet. Despite some black currant, anise and mocha flavors, it's like drinking toothpicks."
US,93.0,40.0,Monterey,White Hart Wine,"Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crÃ¨me de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity."
US,90.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,Sleight of Hand,"This is old vine (1978), Wente clone Chardonnay, with bright, spicy fruit flavors of banana, pear and melon. A touch of toast and cracker comes from barrel-fermentation in neutral French oak. Forward and rich, this is one to drink up while it's young and fresh."
US,92.0,35.0,Carneros,Abiouness,"A fine-tuned, complex wine that offers a beautiful blend of cherry, spice, earth, herb, leather and coffee notes all framed in smooth, supple tannins. It's elegant and refined, long on the finish and somewhat lush. A terrific wine from a relative newcomer, Nicole Abiouness."
US,90.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Quilceda Creek,"Soft and lush when first opened, with a fragrant mix of oak and berry, this is broad in the mouth, oaky and liquorous. There is an impression of flatness; it lacks the lift and depth of the other Quilceda reds. But to find any Quilceda at such a modest price must be considered a gift from the wine gods."
France,87.0,14.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Les MaÃ®tres Vignerons de la Presqu'Ã®le de Saint-Tropez,"An attractively balanced wine, this is ripe but fresh. The raspberry and orange fruits are vivid and well etched into the structure of the wine."
US,86.0,28.0,Sonoma County,Watkins Family,"A robust blend of two popular varieties, this full-bodied red is basically dry and fairly tannic. It's enormously rich and extracted in blackberries and cherries, with notes of bacon, beef jerky, tobacco and scads of peppery spices. Drink now."
Spain,93.0,63.0,Toro,Teso La Monja,"Dense intitial aromas suggest rubber on top of blackberry. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is deep as a trench, with layering and firm tannins. Flavors of toasty oak, blackberry, coconut and herbs dance together like a world-class ballet troupe, while the finish is textured, toasty and loaded with power. Drink from 2015??021."
US,92.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"Grace and elegance mark this Pinot, and so does plenty of power. It shows concentrated raspberry essence, cherry tart and drier, tart cranberry flavors, with oak adding richer, sweeter notes of buttered toast. Brisk acidity and soft tannins provide structure. Beautiful now, and should continue to develop over the next 6?? years."
Spain,84.0,45.0,Toro,Bodegas FariÃ±a,"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much."
France,91.0,37.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine Vincent Girardin,"This smooth wine is rich with yellow fruits, an opulent texture and a sprinkling of spice. The acidity and the crisper citrus flavors in the background give the essential lift to this ripe wine. Drink now."
France,91.0,65.0,Champagne,Charles Ellner,"The wine still tastes young, with ripe yellow fruits and bright acidity. Chardonnay dominates the blend, allowing hints of minerality to come through the lime and lemon crispness. Still developing its more toasty character, it will be better from 2017."
France,83.0,13.0,MediterranÃ©e,Jean-Luc Colombo,"Two thirds Syrah and one-third MourvÃ¨dre, this highly aromatic rosÃ© features hints of passion fruit alongside confected, bubblegum flavors balanced by a squirt of lime on the finish. Drink now."
US,87.0,35.0,Santa Maria Valley,Cru,"Ripe, flashy raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors abound in this silky Pinot Noir. It has oak-driven notes of buttered toast and wood spice, and while it's not especially complex, and it's not likely to age, it does offer immediate pleasure."
US,92.0,60.0,Spring Mountain District,Coniglio,"Very rich and extracted, with massive flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that taste like they were baked into a pastry, and sprinkled with cocoa, anise, vanilla and a touch of salt and black pepper. Delicious and forward, and should hold steady over the next six years."
Argentina,90.0,35.0,Mendoza,Bodega Catena Zapata,"A full blast of oak and related aromas open this creamy, ripe wine. Plump on the palate but with just enough acidity to preserve balance, this rich, friendly wine features walnut, papaya and citrus flavors that finish woody, smooth and long. Drink now."
Italy,87.0,14.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Godiolo,"Aromas of spiced plum, coffee, leather and underbrush come together in the glass. The mature palate offers dried black cherry, tar, graphite, smoke and tobacco alongside dry tannins that leave an astringent finish."
US,84.0,15.0,California,Seven Daughters,"A little sweet and jammy in apicots, pineapples and limes, with a sugary finish. But acidity is just fine. Try with Vietnamese and Chinese pork, fish and chicken dishes whose sauces are sugared."
US,88.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"This is an off-dry, fruity style, bringing luscious pear, orange, golden apple and citrus flavors to the front. There's a hint of orange marmalade, and it has good weight and concentration, along with lovely purity of flavor, right through the finish. You'll be reaching for that next glass before you know it."
US,91.0,40.0,Carneros,Landmark,"This Chardonnay is barrel fermented, aged on the lees and spends additional time in the barrel, all resulting in a big, honeyed wine. It is tremendously rich, on top of the underlying ripe fruit flavors of mangoes and peaches. Excellent acidity and firm minerality add complexity."
US,90.0,38.0,Napa Valley,JR Wine,"A polished, elegant Merlot, with good structure framing deep flavors of currants, carob, violets and anise. The thick tannins suggest a good steak. Now through 2009."
Italy,91.0,65.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Piccini,"This earthy expression of Sangiovese offers aromas of fennel, dried hay, rose and a balsamic note. The palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, clove, savory herb and licorice alongside gripping tannins and firm acidity. It still needs to develop. Drink 2020??030."
US,86.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Buttonwood Farm,"A nice, fairly rich wine made from this classic blend of two varieties. It's dry and crisp, with zippy citrus fruits made more complex with notes of peaches and pears and a touch of spicy vanilla."
Australia,94.0,225.0,Clarendon,Clarendon Hills,"A step up from the other Syrahs in the 2008 Clarendon Hills' lineup, the Astralis is firmly tannic and should be long-lived. The masses of rich black-cherry fruit are amply framed by cedary oak without ever being overwhelmed, with the fruit persisting on the long finish. Try around 2018."
France,93.0,60.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau la Marzelle,"Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, this is a fine, smooth and rich wine. Great tannins are cushioned within the ripe blackberry fruits and generous texture. It is already a delicious wine, although certain to age as well. The estate is close to ChÃ¢teau Figeac. Drink from 2022."
Spain,94.0,174.0,Rioja,Sierra Cantabria,"This single-vineyard beauty continues its run of excellence. The '07 is dense, toasty and powerful, with bacon, vanilla, cigar box and wild berry aromas that set up a strong-boned, fully structured palate overflowing with dark cherry, boysenberry, tobacco and sweet vanilla flavors. Needs time; drink from 2012 through 2022."
Italy,93.0,67.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Musella,"Crushed iris, baked plum, cedar, tobacco and new leather aromas seamlessly come together on this bold full-bodied red. Smooth and ripe, the full-bodied palate doles out mature black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and mocha framed in well-knit, velvety tannins. Drink 2018 through 2026."
France,87.0,20.0,Graves,Barton & Guestier,"Closed and tight, this wine takes a while to reveal its ripe pear and apricot flavors. It is rich, but keeps its freshness very much to the fore. Lemon zest and tangerine fruits give acidity, which is rounded out by a spicy, lightly toasty aftertaste."
US,92.0,110.0,Napa Valley,Kelly Fleming,"Sheer lusciousness marks this 100% Cabernet. It was grown on the estate vineyard in Calistoga, and shows great ripeness even in this cool vintage. Brimming with blackberry, currant, blueberry and mocha flavors, it's also rich in oak, courtesy of 80% new French barrels. The alcohol is relatively high, but it gives warmth, rather than heat. Drink from 2018 and beyond."
France,84.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Ravoire et Fils,"Light and bright, this is a fragrant and fruity rosÃ©. On the palate, strawberry flavors are gently caressed with soft acidity, leaving a soft, ripe aftertaste."
France,88.0,12.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Sorin,"From Bandol producer Sorin, this is a rich wine with just a light saltiness from the vineyard's proximity to the sea. It has pure fruit, an attractive citrus tang and lively line of final acidity."
US,82.0,11.0,California,Robert Mondavi,"Gets the Cabernet job done with sweetish blackberry and black currant flavors, tinged with oak-like notes. But it's a fundamentally uninteresting wine, even at this price."
US,99.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cayuse,"In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious."
Spain,90.0,31.0,Rioja,Muga,"If you are of the school that says rosÃ© from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try. Brief skin contact has created a light color and sense of elegance on the nose and palate. Flavors of cantaloupe and peach are lightly sweet but cut by ample acidity. Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence."
US,91.0,58.0,Red Mountain,Gorman,"This is Gorman's reserve wine, a lovely mix of tart, sappy cassis, smoke and bright, brambly berry flavors. Young and tight, this is the quintessential Washington ?garagiste' Syrah/Cab blend?a red wine that is sharp, spicy and detailed, with tangy red berry fruits, hints of pineapple and citrus, and a balanced mix of fruit, spice and smoke."
US,89.0,22.0,Santa Maria Valley,Cambria,"Big, ripe, rich and well-oaked. That pretty much says it all about this show-offy wine, with its bold, tropical fruit flavors, crisp coastal acidity and sleek structure. The tart taste of minerally gunmetal adds complexity."
France,86.0,12.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,ChÃ¢teau de Farel,"This is a bouncy, fresh, fruit-forward wine. Cherry-berry fruit shines from start to finish, ending with just a hint of cocoa. Drink now??017."
US,90.0,49.0,Oregon,MacPhail,"Sourced entirely from the Rose Rock Vineyard in Oregon's Eola-Amity Hills, this is fresh and carries plenty of strawberry fruit alongside cola and a whiff of smoke. The mouthfeel is textural, light and layered, with a pretty, medium-long finish."
US,88.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Fog Crest,"Juicy and slightly reduced, this tightly woven wine shows layers of cranberry, citrus and tea, all wrapped within a cocoon of forested earth and medium-weight body."
US,91.0,70.0,Stags Leap District,Cliff Lede,"A classic Cab blended with smaller handfuls of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this 2011 is balanced and supple in plum, cassis and minty chocolate. The oak is accented in pretty ways by clove, sage and cardamom spice. Structured and soft, the finish is lengthy and the wine perfectly capable of waiting until 2019??021 in a cellar."
Italy,88.0,99.0,Barolo,Tenuta Carretta,"Leafy underbrush, dried sage, rose, grilled herb and leather aromas lead the nose. The straightforward palate delivers sour cherry and ground white pepper alongside firm but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2019."
US,88.0,22.0,North Fork of Long Island,Kontokosta,"Buoyantly fragrant, this voluptuous Chardonnay bursts of mango, guava and berry aromas. The palate is a bit more subdued, suggesting fresh apple and pear. Fruity, fresh and uncomplicated, it's balanced neatly by a flash of acidity on the midpalate. Drink now through 2019."
France,87.0,12.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau du Prieur,"With soft tannins, this wine has a full, fleshy character that's laced with acidity. Black currant fruits and only hints of dryness suggest it is ready to drink."
US,90.0,38.0,Yakima Valley,Chandler Reach,"This is definitely one of Washington's best Sangioveses, capturing the astringency and natural acidity of the grape, but filling in the mid-palate with chewy fruit flavors of berry and spicy cranberry. The light herbal characteristics of the vineyard come through, adding details of leaf and herb. Since this is a 2004, it is already showing some development in the bottle and is drinking very well right now."
US,91.0,36.0,Paso Robles,Daou,"Fresh cut pear drizzled with lemon juice is given warmth by hints of mango and oak on the nose of this Paso white. It's soft and rich on the palate, with tropical elements of banana cream pie cut by apple skin bitterness and citrus pith acidity."
US,92.0,40.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"This blend is a classic brut, of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Each variety plays its best hand, with Pinot Noir bringing rich, ripe raspberries, strawberries and tannins. The Chardonnay brings acidity and tantalizing notes of limes. With a silky, refined mousse, this bubbly is extremely attractive."
Italy,91.0,33.0,Pomino,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,"Lovely aromas of rose, violet, perfumed berry, mint and a balsamic note waft from the glass. The elegant palate delivers crushed red cherry, wild strawberry, orange zest, savory herb and cinnamon. It's balanced with fine-grained tannins and loaded with finesse."
US,85.0,11.0,Central Coast,Cycles Gladiator,"Lightly seared lemons, cut pear and a touch of butter show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is simple and easy to drink with light apple, nectarine and lime touches."
US,88.0,15.0,Lake County,Matchbook,"A spicy aroma of ginger cookies meets dark, blackberry flavors on the palate of this medium-bodied, pure-tasting wine. The gushing fruit flavors are compelling and palate-cleansing, with light tannins and acidity keep it fresh and lively."
US,91.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,Domaine Anderson,"This reserved and classically styled wine has subtle fig and marzipan aromas, is dry on the palate, with a bundle of tight fruit and spice flavors wound up in fresh acidity that emerge slowly with each sip and on the finish. It is a serious wine and a good candidate to age until 2018 or longer."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Puglia,Masseria Altemura,"Aromas of underbrush, grilled mushroom, blue flower and menthol lead the nose. The linear palate offers dried plum, mature blackberry, espresso and licorice, while firm tannins provide support. It finishes on a note of graphite."
US,92.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Sanglier Cellars,"A pure and distinctive fruit flavor, like a blend of rhubarb and blackberry, distinguishes this full-bodied but elegant and velvet-textured wine. There is little or no new oak influence to get in the way of the melody of the grapes themselves. While the wine is lush and broad in mouthfeel, a nice boost of fine tannins and fresh acidity keep it lively."
US,82.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Magness,"A simple wine, made for modern tastes, with sugary orange, vanilla and buttered toast flavors."
US,91.0,46.0,Malibu Coast,Dolin,"This blend of 44% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc makes a strong case for growing Bordeaux varieties in Malibu. Deep and round black currant, Concord grape and wisteria aromas lead into a palate of similar flavors laced with chalky tannins and a buoyant acidity."
US,92.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Brion,"Here's a beautifully structured young Cabernet, blended with a little Merlot, that has turned soft and generous enough after five years to drink now. Yet it shows a complex depth that will enable it to age for a few more years. It is, in a word, delicious, with black currant, black cherry pie, orange zest, cocoa and spicy, smoky oak nuances."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Rueda,Cyatho,"Creamy, almost buttery melon aromas are soft and not snappy. A plump but citrusy mouthfeel is bolstered by fading acidity, while this tastes of dry citrus fruits and salt brine. Bitter grapefruit notes take over on the finish."
US,84.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Loring Wine Company,"Shows good, rich flavors of currants, cherry and blackberry pie filling, cola, mocha and spices. But the mouthfeel is heavy, and the wine is a touch overripe. Now through 2010."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Toscana,Villa Poggio Salvi,"The wine is crisp, easy and keeps the palate refreshed. Light and fresh, this luminous Vermentino would pair with rucola and tomato bruschetta or mixed seafood appetizers."
France,90.0,130.0,Pomerol,Domaine Roses Camille,"This is a succulent wine, with juicy red fruits and a fine structure that gives the wine its texture. Balanced and ready to drink, the wine (which is made in tiny quantities) is a fine mature Bordeaux."
US,90.0,34.0,Russian River Valley,Novy,"Grippy and somewhat subdued and tightly wound, this wine black in color and profile. Blackberry and black licorice open the proceedings, before powerful hits of black pepper. Leather and game are in the mix, too, giving the wine a wild edge. Drink now through 2023."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Glen Ellen,"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce."
France,85.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau des Tourtes,"The wine has mango aromas that set the scene for a tropical, richly fruity wine. Spice gives an extra frisson to this ripe wine. It has an exotic character that is unusual in this style of wine although it doesn't seem out of place or context. Drink now."
France,90.0,22.0,Lirac,ChÃ¢teau la GenestiÃ¨re,"A traditional blend of Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre, this is a silky, medium-bodied wine. Cinnamon and cedar shadings frame bright cherry fruit and linger through the elegant finish. Drink now??019."
France,87.0,16.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Ponzac,"One of three wines from the MoiniÃ© family with different aging potentials and prices, this is the simplest. It's fruity and made to be drunk young, with plenty of blackberry flavor. With its tannins, it will benefit from a few more months of age and be ready from 2018."
Italy,89.0,22.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Adami,"Ripe yellow peach, spring flowers and pastry aromas emerge from the glass. The creamy palate offers crisp Granny Smith apple, white peach and a confectionary note alongside bright acidity and a frothy perlage."
Italy,85.0,26.0,Vino Spumante,Saladini Pilastri,"Made from organically farmed grapes, this sparkling wine from Central Italy has tangy citrus, apple and nutty sensations. Big, steely bubbles and vivacious acidity create a somewhat rough mouthfeel."
US,94.0,50.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Sea Smoke,"Yes, even for a California Pinot, this is a big, strong, full-bodied wine. Southing always is. It could almost morph into a Cabernet Sauvignon. But who cares? It's compellingly delicious, and isn't that what wine is all about? Flavorwise, it tastes of cherries, oranges, red currants, violets, raspberries, cedar and peppery spices, with 65% new oak. The tannins will help carry it across the finish line by 2012 or so."
France,89.0,28.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Les GraviÃ¨res de la Brandille,"There is no question about the richness and structure of this powerful wine. The 2010 vintage has brought that out in every Bordeaux. Here is shows in the rich blackberry fruits, the dense tannins and the general ripeness of the wine. Wait until late 2015 to drink."
US,88.0,20.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Julia's Dazzle,"This pale peach-colored wine brings vibrant aromas of strawberry and cherry. It's lightly spritzy, drinking almost completely dry with weighty feeling fruit flavors."
US,90.0,42.0,Sonoma Valley,Kenwood,"From a vineyard at the base of Sonoma Mountain, this rich red has a strong streak of cedar as well as spearmint, bolstering an herbal taste that complements red cherry and cassis. Firm tannin and integrated oak make for a complete experience."
Spain,83.0,15.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,"This heavily oaked Garnacha smells like clove and horsehide. A drawing, scratchy, resiny palate offers clove and barrel-spice flavors. The wine feels tannic and rubbing on a finish that tastes exclusively of oak-based clove."
US,89.0,18.0,Monterey,Carmel Road,"The underlying wine, before the winemaker put it into oak barrels, was delicious in tangerine and pineapple fruit, brightened with brilliantly crisp acidity and a fine, steely minerality. The oak, which is modest, adds a richer coating of buttered toast. A great price for a Chardonnay this drinkable."
Italy,93.0,40.0,Etna,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,"Aromas of dark berry, mineral, blue flower and leather come together in the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, coffee, oak, licorice and grilled Mediterranean herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. It ends on a mineral note. Drink 2017??025."
US,88.0,22.0,Paso Robles,Cass,"This GSM pink wine offers very inviting notes of fresh watermelon, strawberry, pink rose and slight bubblegum on the nose. With ripe strawberry flavors and a slight orange bitterness toward the finish, this is a perfect wine for sunny afternoons and beach days, if the slightest bit sweet."
US,94.0,260.0,Oakville,Turnbull,"All the individual parts of this 100% Cabernet are, in a word, gargantuan. Yet somehow the wine maintains its balance. The fruit is unbelievably ripe and powerful, with black currants, plums and chocolate that veer into a slight, Port-like finish. The tannins are thick and mellow, while oak adds rich notes of caramel. The result is a stupendously lush, delicious and heady wine. Hold for up to 15 years."
US,89.0,30.0,Amador County,Terra d'Oro,"This wine from one of Amador County's legendary vineyards is structured, oaky and pleasantly dry. Toasty, peppery, grilled aromas and straightforward blackberry and raspberry fruit flavors are backed by firm tannins and acidity, lending the palate appetizing bite. While this vintage tastes tighter than the last two, expect it to mellow through 2020 at least."
US,89.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Fox Run,"Dazzlingly aromatic, this true-to-type Traminette abounds in ripe berry, mango and melon perfume. Dry and delicate in body, it's refreshingly easy-drinking despite heady aromatics. It's not a complex wine, yet undeniably delightful to drink."
US,90.0,30.0,Ballard Canyon,Stolpman,"Boisterous fruit shows on the nose of this wine from the heart of the newish appellation, presented in a specially made Ballard Canyon bottle. Olallieberry jam gains nuance from pulverized purple flowers. The palate begins with straightforward purple fruits then evolves into potpourri, incense and dried berries."
US,90.0,35.0,Carneros,Domaine Carneros,"This is the most attractive and successful of the winery's three releases of 2007 Pinot Noir. It's dry and crisp in acidity and very rich, with oak-inspired waves of cherries, cola, mushu plum sauce and smoky sandalwood. Drink this elegant wine in the next year or two."
US,89.0,62.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foxen,"Tightly wound now, with firm acids and tannins providing a good structure. There's a solid core of cherries and currants, but it's obscured. Needs time. Give it 4?? years in a proper cellar."
Italy,88.0,48.0,Sicilia,Abbazia Santa Anastasia,"Nero d'Avola, Cabernet and Merlot are blended to produce a bold, oak-driven wine with smoky tones of campfire and coal. There are blackberries, prunes and plums in there as well and the wine has a chewy, succulent feel."
Australia,86.0,24.0,Western Australia,Sandalford,"Somewhat weedy on the nose; then shows a lot of overripe cherries on the palate, along with baking spices like clove and cinnamon. Soft and pleasantly chewy."
Spain,90.0,29.0,Priorat,Cims de Porrera,"On the cusp of unbridled excellence, but since it's Cims' second wine it has its limitations. It's a bit woody and needs to broaden out with time in bottle, but even now the licorice, mineral and ripe plum/prune flavors are delightful. And the oak-driven finish of mocha and coffee seals the package."
US,87.0,22.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brander,"Brander's basic Syrah is a good, dry wine, and while it's a little on the light side, it has pretty flavors of blackberries, black pepper, cola and black currants. The alcohol is nice and low, under 14%."
France,87.0,19.0,Bourgogne,Vignerons de Buxy,"A touch of wood aging gives this wine richness, aided by the ripe fruit of the vintage. The wine is full with citrus, crisp apple and ripe pear. With its nervy texture and acidity, it needs to age a bit more. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Inconceivable,"High toned aromas of spice, herbs and sweet plum are followed by black currant and blackberry flavors. It brings undeniable appeal."
US,89.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Hourglass,"Tastes so softly decadent, so rich in jam and chocolate flavors, that it's no surprise to learn the alcohol on this Merlot is a hefty 16.2% by volume. It's almost Port-like, but the finish is dry and clean. It's not for long aging, but with the right foods?Mexican mole beef or lamb comes to kind?this is a good marriage."
US,88.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,MacMurray Ranch,"Lots of rich, savory Pinot flavors in this silky wine. It's kind of generic, and not showing much sense of terroir, but it is a properly grown coastal wine whose brisk acidity highlights cola, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Drink up."
US,92.0,40.0,Napa Valley,J. McClelland,"Mainly from vineyards within the Oak Knoll District, and blending in 10% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot, this wine is yeasty and firm in tar, graphite and soy. Leathery on the palate, it sings in blackberry and black cherry around oaky clove. Drink now through 2020."
US,89.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,Kestrel,"This wine's aromas are bright and fruit forward, with generous black pepper, raspberry, fresh flower, smoked meat and barrel spice notes. The full-bodied palate delivers cranberry flavors that are appealing but more ponderous than the aromas might suggest."
Spain,90.0,34.0,Jerez,GonzÃ¡lez Byass,"Pine resin and a light, oily brine character define the nose on this lithe, fresh fino. Crisp acidity and healthy weight mesh into balance on an easy-to-navigate palate. Flavors of almond, sea brine and toffee finish crisp."
France,87.0,29.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine FranÃ§ois Schmitt,"There is definite structure to this wine, with its tight acidity and dry, apple skin and pear flavors. There is also a touch of spice that gives the wine a unique twist. Drink now."
Argentina,86.0,39.0,Cafayate,Humanao,"At 50% Cab and 50% Malbec, this wine runs outside the mainstream for Argentina. It's dark in color but slightly green and stemmy on the nose. The palate offers a solid mouthfeel with flavors of baked berry fruit, earth and carob. It's sweet at its core, but mildly bitter and candied on the finish. Good but struggles to find a pleasurable sweet spot."
US,92.0,75.0,Paso Robles,Dubost,"This powerful blend of 23% Malbec, 20% Carmenere, 20% Cabernet Franc, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 7% Petite Verdot delivers layered aromas of olallieberry, grape candy, sage, anise and lava rocks. Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity."
Australia,83.0,17.0,Hunter Valley,Pepper Tree,"Young Hunter Valley SÃ©millon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8??0 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors."
US,92.0,26.0,Sonoma County,Matanzas Creek,"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits."
Italy,88.0,19.0,OltrepÃ² Pavese,De Filippi,"Toasted nut and bread crust aromas carry over to the bright palate along with mature apple, strawberry, citrus and a note of dried herb. Soft small bubbles lend elegance while fresh acidity lifts the finish."
Italy,94.0,90.0,Taurasi,Mastroberardino,"Mature black-skinned berry, ripe plum, baking spice, violet and a whiff of earth are some of the aromas you'll find on this impressive red. The structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed blackberry, vanilla and a dusting of cocoa framed in velvety tannins. Even though it's already accessible, it will continue to evolve and age well for years to come. Drink through 2028."
US,93.0,55.0,North Fork of Long Island,Paumanok,"Sultry black-cherry and berry flavors and ripe deeply integrated tannins are held upright by a strident backbone of acidity in this elegantly structured Cabernet Franc. Swathes of fresh peppery greens offset sweet spice and vanilla tones on the midpalate. It's an elegant, deeply textural wine that's lovely already but should only improve through at least 2025."
Argentina,91.0,40.0,Vista Flores,Altos Las Hormigas,"This Malbec from the Vista Flores zone of the Uco Valley falls outside the box. An exotic bouquet comprised of blueberry, graham cracker, citrus peel and cardamom aromas stirs interest, while a jammy palate deals blueberry, baking spice, Middle Eastern spice and blackened flavors. This is extracted but juicy on the finish. Drink through 2018."
US,93.0,48.0,California,Villa Oneiro,"This wine from the Palos Verdes coastline is redolent with sagebrush, crushed anise and alpine strawberries on the herbally aromatic nose. The sage also powers the palate, alongside juniper and pine, all set against a wild berry frame. This is a big Pinot, though it is relatively light in structure and happily reliant on savory herbs rather than overly ripe fruits."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Chianti Classico,Triacca,"This has subdued toasted oak, underbrush and dark spice aromas, accented by a whiff of menthol. The lean, medium-bodied palate offers black cherry, espresso and sweet oak flavors, framed by fine-grained but not very persistent tannins."
Italy,88.0,23.0,Toscana,Poggio al Tesoro,"This opens with aromas of white and yellow wild flower and yellow stone fruit. The bright palate doles out juicy yellow peach, nectarine and a hint of Mediterranean herb alongside fresh acidity."
France,90.0,72.0,Champagne,De Venoge,"Bottled in a replica of a 19th-century crystal carafe, this wine is a blend of crus from the Montagne de Reims. On the dry side of brut, it has a lively sliced apple and citrus character as well as refreshing, lively acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
US,88.0,18.0,Mendocino County,Graziano,"This is attractively fruity in aroma, accented by smoke and spices. It smells plummy and tastes a bit like wood smoke and black pepper. Medium to full bodied, it is well balanced and just tannic enough to keep the texture firm and appetizing."
Australia,89.0,12.0,Clare Valley,Leasingham,"This wine earns every penny of its modest price tag with a bright palate of petrol, talcum powder and wet stones propping up aromas of white flowers, cumin and lime. The finish could be longer but with this stunning nose and palate, we're not complaining. Drink now."
Spain,91.0,49.0,Jerez,GonzÃ¡lez Byass,"A unique and individual style of Sherry, even among palo cortados. It's dark amber in color, with a pungent mix of aromas that include molasses, raw brown sugar, chocolate and campfire. Feels fresh on the tongue, with coffee, dark chocolate and core peach and citrus flavors."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma Coast Vineyards,"This wine's greenness shows that it's not quite ripe, but it's an interesting wine. Dry, racy and creamy, this is not without complexity."
US,84.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Judd's Hill,"The pineapple, orange and vanilla flavors seem a bit thin. But it's nicely dry, with a clean burst of acidity."
France,88.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Thuerry,"While the wine is full bodied and rich, it is also deliciously fresh and with lively fruitiness. There is great acidity here, a bright layer of red currant fruits and wild strawberries, making it a good food rosÃ©."
US,88.0,20.0,Yakima Valley,Mount Baker,"Fresh, spicy and crisp, this deft Malbec shines with pretty raspberry fruit and sharp acidity. Focused and clean, it's a big step forward for this winery."
US,84.0,45.0,Rockpile,Rosenblum,"An overly soft, alcoholic wine. It tastes like the blackberry and cola syrup that goes into soda, before the carbonation is added, and finishes prickly hot."
US,94.0,90.0,Stags Leap District,Silverado,"An absolutely gorgeous Cabernet. It flatters all the way through, from the flamboyantly ripe cassis, cherry, cocoa and anise flavors to the smooth tannins and long, spicy finish. So refined and rich, yet so elegant. Should age for at least the next 6?? years."
US,92.0,39.0,Wahluke Slope,Dusted Valley,"A blend of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest."
Australia,97.0,225.0,Barossa,Torbreck,"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now??030."
France,88.0,20.0,RÃ©gniÃ©,Domaine DuprÃ©,"This is a soft wine with a great depth of red fruits and fresh acidity. The tannins are light, just a hint of dry behind the fragrant, bright fruitiness. The wine, made from old vines, is ready to drink."
Australia,91.0,20.0,Eden Valley,Yalumba,"Shows all the beautiful Viognier notes you could ask for: flowers, spice, apricot and melon, carried by a succulent mouthfeel that remains fresh and vibrant from start to lingeringly spicy finish. Drink now."
US,86.0,24.0,Monticello,King Family,"BrÃ»lÃ©ed pastry crust and salted butter aromas overlay golden apple and spiced pear tones. The palate feels lax with curved acids, which lead to a light, yielding finish."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Puglia,Antica Enotria,"This is a clear, bright and tonic white wine from the deep south of Italy, showing aromas of honeysuckle, pineapple and pear. The fruit used for this easygoing white is farmed organically."
Argentina,87.0,25.0,Mendoza,Durigutti,"Ripe raisiny aromas of spiced fruit cake are heavy and sweet. Matching the nose, this Bonarda feels thick and chunky with grating tannins. Flavors of chocolaty black fruits are oaky, spicy and minty, while this is equally woody on the finish."
US,88.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Market Vineyards,"Equal parts Viognier and Roussanne, this offers aromas of ripe peach and flowers that lead to dry, full-bodied flavors that taper toward the finish."
US,90.0,52.0,Anderson Valley,Black Kite,"Tasted in May of 2012, this shows an immaturity, where all the parts haven't yet come together. It has a big, rich black-cherry flavor, with elaborate smoky oak, brisk acidity, firm tannins and heat from the alcohol all vying for dominance. Needs time; cellar it until 2015."
US,88.0,18.0,El Dorado,Holly's Hill,"Florally pungent, with sweet peach and apricot notes, this smells great. It's richly textured and balanced."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Primitivo di Manduria,MatanÃ©,"Tobacco, mature plum, espresso and toast aromas lead the nose. The round, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, mature blackberry, licorice, black pepper and toasted oak alongside velvety tannins."
US,89.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Apex,"A blend of fruit from Elephant Mountain, Dionysus, Red Haven, Alder Ridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this fruit-forward wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, anise, raspberry jam and fruit leather. The cranberry and raspberry flavors are sweet, rich and concentrated, backed by lightly grainy tannins. It seems a bit advanced for its age but brings a delicious factor that is hard to ignore. Drink now."
Italy,90.0,65.0,Rosso Piceno,Bucci,"Hailing from old vines, this delicious blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sangiovese is concentrated but elegant. Aromas of tilled soil, ripe blackberry, black cherry, black pepper and a hint of vanilla take center stage. The palate shows juicy sour cherry, accented with balsamic herbs and a mineral note balanced by freshness and supple tannins."
France,91.0,20.0,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,"Evocatively tender notes of Conference pear appear on the nose. The palate is ample with juicy pear and has a generous dollop of residual sweetness. Nonetheless, this is balanced by vigorous lively freshness, leaving a harmonious, rounded, light-footed and elegant wine with a moreish finish."
US,88.0,24.0,Calaveras County,Twisted Oak,"Named for Twisted Oak's infamous rubber chicken, Ruben, this Marsanne-Grenache Blanc-Roussanne blend is as fun as its namesake, with luscious lemon and a trace of tar in the background culminating in a dry freshness and just a tinge of almonds."
France,90.0,125.0,Pommard,Domaine Faiveley,"Beautifully perfumed wine, with fresh red fruits and some fine tannins. The wood element is perhaps too dominant for the weight of the wine. Hopefully this will subside. Give it 3?? years."
US,90.0,40.0,Chalk Hill,Rock Wall,"Elusive on the nose, this wine opens in the glass to show an intensity of chocolate amidst soft layers of black fruit, leather and pepper. The full-bodied texture is soft and generously ripe."
Italy,89.0,24.0,Collio,Gradis'ciutta,"Made with Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla and Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia flower and yellow apple. The bright palate offers peach, pear, nectarine zest and mineral alongside vibrant acidity. It's racy but balanced."
Italy,88.0,47.0,Franciacorta,Ricci Curbastro,"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this delivers delicate aromas of stone fruit, citrus and white almond. The bright palate offers up mature yellow apple, vanilla and a hint of lemon pastry alongside a persistent perlage."
France,95.0,310.0,BÃ¢tard-Montrachet,Olivier Leflaive,"This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now."
US,86.0,26.0,Knights Valley,Lawer,"Made using grapes sourced from a high valley between the Russian River and Napa valleys, this wine is rich in tropical fruit, lemon, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. Brisk acidity helps to keep it from seeming cloying."
Italy,92.0,48.0,Barbaresco,Ugo Lequio,"This is an exciting wine with a lively cornucopia of flavors including tiny berry fruit, vanilla, allspice, powdered licorice and root beer. The wine is nicely aged and balanced with a vertical approach that underscores the wine's natural intensity and complexity. It's unusual and interesting in the mouth, with gritty tannins and intense spice flavors."
Spain,84.0,15.0,Cava,CodornÃ­u,"Apple skin and red-plum aromas are herb-infused and suggest tomato sauce and carrot juice. A full, almost sticky feeling palate deals plum, cherry and tomato flavors along with notes of oregano and tarragon. A finish with red-licorice flavors and tomato notes is the final salvo on this blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay."
Italy,93.0,66.0,Barolo,Palladino,"This wine's rose petal, herb, dark spice and woodland berry aromas slowly take shape, along with a whiff of new leather. The full-bodied, energetic palate delivers juicy red cherry, cranberry, clove, cinnamon and orange peel flavors while youthfully austere tannins and vibrant acidity provide the framework. Drink 2023??033."
US,88.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mazzocco,"With over 16% alcohol and a splash of Petite Sirah, this Zin can be called generous. It has a rich, creamy texture, and the black currant, cherry jam, mocha and anise flavors are fully dry."
Italy,92.0,43.0,Alto Adige,Abbazia di Novacella,"Aromas of ripe strawberry, mint, pipe tobacco and a whiff of forest floor take center stage on this structured red. The full-flavored elegant palate boasts a nice depth of flavors including red cherry, raspberry, cake spice and a hint of new leather alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
US,87.0,40.0,Napa Valley,The Prisoner,"The powerful blend is as big as ever in this vintage, combining Zinfandel with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Charbono. The grapes are sourced from some of Napa Valley's finest sites, including Tofanelli Vineyard in Calistoga. It's expressive and expansive in tobacco and tar, thick and rich, with a finish of bittersweet chocolate."
US,93.0,63.0,Napa Valley,B Cellars,"A dry, complex wine emboldened by the 63% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 37% Syrah, this is a compelling combination of black-olive tapenade and smoky tannin founded atop ripe California blueberry, cassis and black currant. Saddle and tobacco appear on the finish, giving it a spicy end. Drink now through 2022."
US,88.0,39.0,Sonoma Coast,WesMar,"Licorice and anise give this coastal wine a sense of intrigue and complexity around fresh, vibrant layers of red cherry and cranberry. Soft and medium in weight, the finish shows its oak, with a bit of concentration and power."
Canada,91.0,40.0,Niagara-On-The-Lake,Pillitteri,"Harvested on January 3rd at a ripe 37.8 Brix, it brings an aromatic explosion of dried apricot, citrus, honey, apple and pear. It's full bodied, rich and luscious with well balanced acidity drawing out the finish."
Italy,88.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tassi,"Subdued on the nose, this wine still needs to stretch its proverbial muscles. Its flavors of cherry liqueur, rum cake, blackberry and forest underbrush give voice to a clean, traditional winemaking philosophy."
France,89.0,13.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,Mas des Bressades,"Importer Bobby Kacher seemingly has a pipeline to the best rosÃ©s around NÃ®mes, and Mas des Bressades is a perennial favorite. The 2008 features layers of ripe fruit--berries and peaches--brought together in a lush, full-bodied but not overblown wine. Drink now."
US,90.0,10.0,California,Gnarly Head,"This great buy shows a sophisticated blend of spice and fruit aromas. Medium-bodied and classically dry, it has good balance, moderate fruit flavors and light toast and ginger notes that add complexity."
Australia,86.0,8.0,South Eastern Australia,Stonehaven,"This wine could be the poster boy for Australian Chardonnay. The nectarine and peach aromas and flavors are coddled by a touch of vanilla and the entire package is soft, juicy and easy to drink. It's nothing fancy, just yummy weekday wine."
France,84.0,11.0,Vin de Table Francais,Domaine des Sablonnettes,"Literally friends and neighbors (the guys on the label dancing and playing an accordion), this wine is a light, soft blend of Groslot and Cabernet Franc from Anjou. It is light, strawberry-juice flavored, with green acidity. Ready to drink now."
US,86.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Lazy River,"Not noticeably sweet, despite its low alcohol, this is a bowl full of crisp, green apple fruit. Clean and simple."
Italy,95.0,63.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Armilla,"You could get lost in the enticing fragrance of this wine thanks to wild berry, blue flower, baking spice, chopped herb and saddle leather aromas. The smooth, elegantly structured palate is just as inviting, doling out juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. Polished tannins and fresh acidity lend balance and support. An impressive effort from this winery?one of Montalcino's little known gems."
Italy,90.0,26.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,Montecappone,"Named after the King of Sweden who was born in Jesi in 1194, this elegant expression of Verdicchio opens with a bouquet of dried Spanish broom, sage and stone fruit. The palate offers peach, lemon zest and tropical fruit flavors alongside savory saline and almond notes, all supported by vibrant acidity."
US,88.0,26.0,Nevada County,Naggiar,"Bold and very ripe in flavor, but also soft in texture, this wine is packed with blackberry, boysenberry and fig notes. It seems slightly sweet on the palate and finishes with a jammy touch. While full-bodied, it's smooth and easy to sip."
France,95.0,110.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Canon la GaffeliÃ¨re,"One of the peculiarities of St.-Ãmilion's classification is that Canon la GaffeliÃ¨re is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes."
Spain,92.0,50.0,Alella,Alta Alella,"Deep, earthy, ripe aromas of blackberry, cola and asphalt are potent. This varietal Syrah from Catalonia is fleshy and wide across the palate, with tannic grip and structure. Satisfying, lusty flavors of raspberry, plum and cassis come with peppery spice in front of a meaty, firm finish. Drink 2017??023."
Spain,85.0,20.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Finca Constancia,"Distinct yet unusual aromas of vanilla extract and butterscotch announce and confirm that this was barrel fermented. Low vibrancy and bounce on the palate create a sense of flat heaviness. Salty peach and melon flavors are buried in wood spice, while this tastes dry, pithy and resiny on a mild finish."
US,86.0,15.0,Lodi,Victor Vineyards,"Lively in aromas and with vivid flavors like grapefruit and apricot, this wine tastes lightly herbal and appetizing. It has light oaky, buttery notes in the aroma and fairly vivid fruit flavors. The texture that gets richer with each sip, revealing a rather full body."
US,89.0,46.0,Willamette Valley,Fairsing,"The Sullivan designate complements the Dardis, with a different mix of clones. Here it's Pommard and Dijon 777, and the wine is robust and textural. Aging in 28% new French oak brings up highlights of baking spices around fruit that runs from rhubarb to strawberry to cherry pie. It's balanced and light, and should drink well through 2022."
US,93.0,54.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Red Stich,"Longtime San Francisco Giant Rich Aurilia teams with fellow baseballer Dave Roberts to produce a wine with restrained, focused aromas of black cherry, pencil shavings, sarsaparilla and hints of allspice. The palate is all about black gravel and turned loam, with tiny bits of black cherry and noticeably firm tannins."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Barbaresco,Ca'RomÃ¨,"A bold and modern expression of Nebbiolo, this shows bright, pulpy fruit and pretty aromas of blackberry, crushed clove and earthy, rusty tones. There's a touch of bitter almond on the finish and loads of elegant fruit."
US,88.0,40.0,Willamette Valley,Youngberg Hill Vineyards,"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Orlando Abrigo,"Straightforward and already accessible, this opens with aromas of rubber, coffee, vanilla, toasted oak and plum cake. The extracted palate delivers mature black cherry, chocolate, and sage alongside evolved, fleeting tannins. Enjoy through 2019."
France,92.0,90.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau d'Esclans,"The top rosÃ© from Sacha Lichine's Esclans estate, this is wood aged and the flavors of wood are apparent, if subtle. The wine has a great smooth texture, the fruit well integrated, showing richness as well as elegance. Not classic Provence, but certainly impressive."
Italy,90.0,26.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Verrazzano,"Underbrush, rose, dark spice and black-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose of this elegantly structured red. The savory palate delivers fleshy plum, juicy black cherry licorice and ground pepper alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018."
France,92.0,24.0,Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"Ripe, yellow pear, stone and earth are united by a zesty grapefruit perfume. The streak of purity at the center of this is invigorating, with an enlivening backbone of tinkling acidity. This bottling does justice to a difficult vintage?and is all the more alluring for it. Something racy and pure at the core makes you want to delve deeply into this wine."
France,89.0,8.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Labrousse,"This perfumed wine is firm with tannins that gives a spicy character. It has a dry core, a juicy aftertaste and rich blackberry fruit that will certainly develop as it matures. Give it some time and drink from 2021."
US,92.0,80.0,Oakville,Vine Cliff,"Leather, tobacco and mocha combine effortlessly in this medium-bodied wine, a juicy, broad expression of the variety that drinks well. Black cherry and currant fruit flavors integrate into the quiet oak."
Italy,89.0,33.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Massimiliano Vivalda,"A serious contender with sophisticated notes of leather, barnyard and cedar wrapped up in toasty vanilla oak. A hint of char adds an edge to a streamlined palate infused with earth, mushroom and strawberry tones. A slight lack of persistence takes it out of the top flight. Fully mature, drink now."
France,91.0,40.0,Sancerre,Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils,"This perfumed and wood-aged wine is so stylish. It is smooth in texture, paced with acidity and shows well-balanced red fruits. The wine finishes with fine acidity and delicious fruitiness. Drink now."
Spain,88.0,17.0,Ribera del Duero,Arrocal,"After an initial blast of raw oak this Ribera settles nicely to show appealing leather and berry aromas along with savory blackberry and molasses flavors. There's also ample spice, chocolate and toast to give it a dark personality. Nice for a young wine; it's flush, lush and quite dense."
Spain,90.0,19.0,Priorat,Casa Gran del Siurana,"Rubbery, leathery aromas of minerally berry and raisin set up a tight, well-structured palate with bracing tannins. Fully ripe flavors of dark fruits and minerals finish warm and a bit baked, with a firm, proper feel. Drink through 2019."
US,93.0,55.0,Sonoma Coast,Small Vines,"This tiny, family-run production shows a tremendous talent at growing grapes and making wines of great substance and sophistication. It aims for a bright, restrained and complex style, which it achieves here with aplomb. Black cherry, mint and a tease of smoky oak accent a fleshy, lengthy texture and body that shines in acidity."
Italy,92.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Col d'Orcia,"Earthy aromas suggest tilled soil, savory herb, leather, dried rose and a whiff of game. The bright palate offers crushed cherry, black raspberry, savory herb and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's well balanced and fresh. A licorice note signals the close."
US,82.0,10.0,California,Rare,"This seems so sweet, you could almost classify it as a dessert wine. It has simple orange, pineapple and vanilla flavors."
US,84.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Cannonball,"This is a candy-jammy Merlot, with flavors of nougat, sour cherry Lifesavers and cola. It's fine for big parties or as an inexpensive house red wine."
Australia,91.0,35.0,Tasmania,Dalrymple,"This may be a touch more elegant than the 2012, but otherwise, it's remarkably consistent. It's medium bodied, with supple tannins framing cherry fruit underlain by hints of beetroot and ground spices?clove, nutmeg and cinnamon. Drink now??024."
US,86.0,11.0,California,Fat Cat,"Lots of blackberry, cherry and spicy cola flavors in this dry, clean wine. It has the classic tannins and balance of a fine Cabernet. Drink now with a good steak."
France,85.0,19.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau l'Escart,"Perfumed and fragrant, this shows wood and fruity perfumes in harmony. It's attractive, forward and ready to drink."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Cortona,Leuta,"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, espresso, dried herbs and toasted oak lead the nose. The one-dimensional palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and ground pepper while firm, fine-grained tannins give it a polished feel."
US,87.0,20.0,California,Honor Winery,"It's nice to find a well-balanced, fruity but structured wine that's dry and will be very versatile at meals. It has red cherry and cranberry flavors, firm acidity and tannins for grip in the mouth, and a clean finish."
US,87.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Lamoreaux Landing,"Peppery spice, tart goosebery and white grapefruit notes shine in this varietally characteristic GrÃ¼ner Veltliner. It's delicate in concentration but cutting and fresh, finishing on a refreshing mineral tone. Drink now through 2018."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Collio,Russiz Superiore,"This is a truly amazing Sauvignon from northeast Italy that rests on the lees for three years to shape a rich, complex and elegant white wine. The variety's characteristic aromas of exotic fruit and spring flowers are all there and the wine is impressively generous and creamy on the finish."
US,86.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Concannon,"This is a good, drily tannic red wine. It's muscular in the full-bodied weight and full-throttle blackberry and cherry fruit, and the oak stands out. Yet it has a balanced elegance. Drink now."
Argentina,90.0,25.0,Mendoza,Mi TerruÃ±o,"Rich aromas of molasses, chocolate and fig paste announce a ripe, thick Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. On the palate, this is grabby, intense and oaky. Flavors of oak grain, graphite, chocolate and berry fruits finish saturated and heavy, lacking elegance."
US,93.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Baer,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah, finished off with Petit Verdot. The aromas and flavors of dried herbs, blackberry, tar and fresh flowers show multiple layers, with the palate displaying density and richness. It needs time to be at its best but will be worth the wait. Drink 2020??027."
US,84.0,22.0,Southern Oregon,Erath,"From Southern Oregon, this new vintage of the winery's Pinot Blanc has been given the all-star treatment??00% barrel fermented sur lie. It's hot, big, sharp and bold, but perhaps stretched a bit too far for the delicate, elegant flavors of the Pinot Blanc grape. The fruit carries no weight and the barrels therefore take over, with bitter phenolics and too much oak."
US,91.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"Savory herbs mix with clove and barrel spices on the aromas. The palate is full bodied and decadent, with a palate-coating feel."
US,94.0,48.0,El Pomar District,Sextant,"Very dark-purple fruit meet with crushed black rocks, dense purple flowers and roasted beef on the nose of this lush and delicious bottling, which is bolstered by bits of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec. Soft black cherry, caramel and vanilla flavors coat the palate, with slate, cocoa, espresso bean and graham cracker touches."
Argentina,89.0,22.0,Mendoza,Alma Negra,"Like a good Bonarda should be, this is sweet, lush, dense and jammy on the nose. The palate brings big tannins and a slight rubbery mouthfeel, but the flavors of black cherry and wild berry are big, tasty and untamed. Full of power; needs airing upon opening but aging isn't necessary. Includes 20% Malbec and 10% Cab Franc."
US,91.0,35.0,Sonoma-Napa,Chandon,"Floral and inviting, this features 24% Chardonnay in an otherwise Pinot Noir-based sparkler. The two combine for an inviting nose of fresh wild strawberry jam amidst a smooth, silky texture and creamy mousse. The acidity is sharp and generous."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Basilicata,Taverna,"Red berry, dried wild herb and yellow spring flower aromas mingle in the glass. The bright refreshing palate offers up juicy morello cherry and raspberry before closing on a tangy note."
Argentina,83.0,17.0,RÃ­o Negro Valley,Aniello,"With little fruit to the nose, this cool-climate Chardonnay smells strained. A chunky palate has a canned-fruit character, tasting faintly of peach and mandarin orange. It lacks freshness, fruit and varietal correctness."
France,92.0,80.0,CorbiÃ¨res-Boutenac,GÃ©rard Bertrand,"Always a dense, dark and concentrated selection, La Forge is a wine that is immediately attractive but would be best after a few years of cellaring. Notes of dark berry preserves, muddled boysenberry, raspberry sauce, cocoa, leather and truffle abound on the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is plush and creamy, with medium tannins and a texture like crushed velvet. The finish is long and spicy, offering notes of black pepper and charred oak spice."
US,87.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"Hints of orange blossom accent sugar cookie and brioche in this sparkling blend of Chardonany, Pinot Noir, Cayuga and Pinot Gris. It's zesty in lemon-lime acidity, finishing rich and dense."
Italy,90.0,13.0,Vermentino di Sardegna,Contini,"Aromas of citrus blossom, chamomile and a whiff of tropical fruit waft out of the glass. The lively, delicious palate offers ripe white peach, apricot, pear, chopped herb and a light mineral note alongside bright acidity."
US,87.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,O?¢S Winery,"Light and fruity, with young vine flavors of strawberries and cherries."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Tenute dei Vallarino,"Aromas of blackberry, toast, chopped mint and a whiff of dried rose lead the nose. The juicy palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, ripe blackberry, clove and anise alongside fresh acidity and round tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close."
US,93.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Illumination,"This is a new wine from Agustin Huneeus, of Quintessa. It's made largely from grapes off the Rutherford estate, and contains one-quarter SÃ©millon. Oak does not play a significant role, although the lees do. The wine itself is absolutely dry, crisp and minerally. It has palate-stimulating citrus flavors and is extraordinarily refined. Its only peer in Napa Valley is Mondavi's Tokalon FumÃ© Blanc."
Italy,85.0,17.0,Trentino,Lechthaler,"Clean mineral notes blend nicely with fresh berry fruit, red rose and raspberry. This is a simple but genuine wine that would pair with roasted fish or vegetable risotto."
Australia,95.0,145.0,McLaren Vale,Nashwauk,"Nashwauk is Kaesler's McLaren Vale project, first released from the 2006 vintage. The 2010 is full bodied, creamy-textured and plush, filled with dark fruit and hints of vanilla, asphalt, maple syrup and mocha. The supple tannins enhance rather than impede the finish, contributing scary length. Drink now??030."
US,85.0,50.0,Dundee Hills,Erath,"Herbal and short, this offers a very light watermelon flavor, along with plenty of herb and tomato leaf notes. It's on the slender side, with a quick-to-fade finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Solitary Cellars,"A touch of new oak in the aroma and bright raspberry and cherry in the flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to sip and enjoy. Typical for the grape variety, it has noticeable liveliness in the texture and a bit of tang on the finish."
US,87.0,26.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cavatappi,"This wine offers aromas of leather, maraschino cherries, rose petal and medicine cabinet. It shows a bit of its age but still has time, with grainy tannins and soy flavors propping it up."
France,89.0,23.0,Alsace,Domaine G. Metz,"The nose is rich with Red Delicious apple notes. The palate adds lemon freshness and a tangy, slightly bitter but appetizing streak of zestiness. The finish is restrained, just dry and clean."
US,88.0,34.0,Yakima Valley,Dusted Valley,Cream and spice aromas lead to a palate accented by peach and lees flavors that stretch out the finish.
Italy,86.0,30.0,Toscana,Fattoria la Castellina,"Reale (100% Merlot) offers sweet cherry and raspberry aromas with light touches of spice and toasted almond in the background. This ruby colored wine offers an easy, fresh and lean feel in the mouth."
US,91.0,13.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mercer Canyons,"Half barrel-fermented and half done in stainless steel, this classy effort seems to overdeliver. It starts with good fruit, but the feeling is that winemaker Jessica Munnell did everything right, and maxxed out the complexity. It's a sensuous mix of grape and barrel, steel and butterscotch, with a lively, lingering finish."
Italy,87.0,77.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Tabarrini,"A touch of strawberry jam at the outset suggests that the fruit came out of the vineyard a little on the overripe side. Plum, cherry and blackberry preserves are backed by spice and rock solid astringency that is characteristic of Sagrantino."
US,82.0,14.0,California,Cupcake,"Made with undisclosed grape varieties, this rustic, softly sweet wine has apricot, honey and herb flavors."
US,87.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Red Newt Cellars,"Scents of white grapefruit and honeydew rind introduce this dry, refreshing Riesling. It's quite delicate in structure but concentrated with fresh apple flavor accented by bright lemon-lime acidity. Finishes on an earthy saffron note."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Castelli del Grevepesa,"Aromas of blackberry, plum, coffee and toast lead the nose. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, toasted oak, coconut and oak-driven spice alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink soon before the remaining fruit disappears."
France,88.0,19.0,Alsace,Joseph Cattin,"Fresh juicy Conference pear dominates nose and palate. The body is light and flavors are off dry, giving an extra boost to the ripe pear notes. The finish has a fresh pithy edge and is moreish. Drink soon while aromas are at their peak."
Italy,96.0,125.0,Barolo,Gianni Voerzio,"A stunning wine with amazing intensity and a very distinct personality, this has aromas of ripe fruit, leather, tobacco, cola, dried ginger and cigar box. The mouthfeel is very long, smooth and velvety. Age this wine 10??5 more years."
US,89.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"Steel is the medium and the message, meaning it's completely unoaked, with no malolactic fermentation. The flavors are spicy and bright, mixing cucumber, mint and green melon with a dash of white pepper."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Pietrafitta,"Making wine since 961, Pietrafitta presents a crisp, fresh Vernaccia that shows the best characteristics of this historic white wine from Tuscany. Lemongrass, kiwi and peach aromas rise to the front of the bouquet."
France,86.0,31.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Cave de Turckheim,"Fresh raspberry flavors highlight this fruity, softly creamy wine that has a fresh, clean and bright aftertaste. It's a fine apÃ©ritif style of wine."
US,92.0,32.0,Lodi,The Tribe,"A tempting aroma of vanilla and cream leads to mouthfilling fruit and baking-spice flavors in this full-bodied, plush-textured and concentrated wine. The details of bright fruit and nutmeg weave through an almost unctuous sensation on the palate and linger nicely on the finish."
US,83.0,14.0,California,Red Rock,"Rustic in the texture, with unevenly ripened tannins, and the cherry and berry flavors have a touch of raisins. Pretty standard stuff."
US,88.0,18.0,Mendocino County,Paul Dolan,"Dolan continues to produce stellar whites and reds from organically grown grapes in Mendocino County. This Chardonnay is ripe and full of minerality, a liquid form of crisp apple with vanilla on the finish."
US,95.0,90.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cayuse,"The Frog is a bit reductive, a bit shy in 2009 and needs extra decanting. With proper breathing time, it shows inviting notes of violets and strawberries, and it gains concentration through the midpalate, with additions of cherry and an almost liquid minerality. An almost delicate version of this wine."
Italy,88.0,54.0,Toscana,Castello di Poppiano,"A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, this has a shy nose that slowly unleashes aromas of black-skinned fruit and cedar. The smooth accessible palate offers black cherry and cinnamon alongside round tannins."
Australia,87.0,15.0,South Eastern Australia,Tall Poppy,"A pleasant surprise, this budget-priced Viognier shows plenty of plump fruit without getting overly big or blowsy. Citrus and pineapple flavors reflect the moderate alcohol levels, finishing on a juicy, succulent note. Drink now."
Australia,85.0,15.0,Yarra Valley,Long Flat,"If you're looking for a clean, well made Pinot Noir at an affordable price, you could do a lot worse. Modest cherry and cinnamon flavors ease across the palate on silky tannins and linger elegantly on a slightly dusty finish. Drink now."
US,85.0,7.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"A dry, slightly washed-out Sauvignon Blanc, with varietally correct flavors of apple and herb. Thins out quickly, but a decent quaffer at this price."
US,87.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Atalon,"A Bordeaux-style blend, predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley. This red is made in a more robust style, the tannins still a tad dry, the fruit earthy in sage and cedar with black cherry and chocolaty spice at the fore."
France,84.0,12.0,Beaujolais,Loron et Fils,"This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors?a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers."
Argentina,91.0,16.0,Mendoza,Fabre Montmayou,"Black cherry, blackberry and marzipan aromas are full, lusty and inviting. This has a chewy, full-bodied and layered mouthfeel to go with the dark-fruit flavors that are aided by spice notes. A peppery chocolaty finish is solid, ripe and friendly. Drink through 2020."
US,86.0,25.0,North Fork of Long Island,Jamesport,"Quite savory in style, this dry full-bodied Riesling suggests pressed apple and pear flavors marked by brisk slightly puckering acidity. A touch of sweet spice warms a moderately long finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,San Simeon,"Very reliable and rewarding for everyday drinking, this wine packs lush black cherries, well-integrated purple flowers, savory roasted beef and touches of salted caramel and oak into the nose. Cooked blueberries, caramel and French-toast flavors show on the palate."
US,90.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"This is fruity and ripe, forward and round, with appealing tropical fruit flavors. There's moderate, but adequate, acidity, and the flavors are rounded off with a toasty note from aging 10 months in 30% new French oak. Drink this now through 2018."
US,91.0,35.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Reasons,"Harvested on the night of the new moon (hence the name); this was aged in one-year-old French oak. The fruit stands out, striking for its dense purple shade, its meaty undertones and its pretty purity. It's overlaid with big barrel flavors of caramel and toast?delicious, but dominant. Let it breathe!"
Spain,86.0,23.0,Ribera del Duero,Finca Torremilanos,"Berry aromas are jammy and show a pinch of green. The palate matches the nose; it's jammy and soft, with blackberry and spiced plum flavors. Tastes good and rich but feels heavy and a little flabby."
Italy,86.0,45.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Pico Maccario,"This full-bodied Barbera has ripe black-cherry aromas nuanced with toast and coffee notes. The palate is structured, with dark fruit flavors, pepper, toasted oak and espresso notes, but the drying wood tannins result in an abrupt finish. Grape Expectations and Massanois Imports."
US,87.0,27.0,Sonoma Coast,Peter Cellars,"A pretty Pinot, dry, crisp and silky. It shows polished raspberry and cherry tart, cola and spicy pomegranate flavors, framed in sweet, toasty oak. Drink now."
US,88.0,19.0,Alexander Valley,J. Rickards,"Effervescent in honeysuckle and papaya, this vineyard-designated white offers medium body and a long length. It becomes a rounded expression of melon and minerality on the palate that's both fresh and fruity."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Roero,San Silvestro,"Delicate scents of white flower and apricot lead the nose. The bright, round palate doles out ripe peach, pear and a hint of hazelnut that lead to a fresh finish."
Argentina,89.0,18.0,Mendoza,Soluna,"Rich, jammy black-fruit aromas come with plenty of wood, char and campfire-related grit. The palate is chunky and a bit soft, with prune, raisin, baked plum and herbal flavors, especially on the finish, which feels plump, loamy and fully ripe."
US,84.0,15.0,California,Spellbound,"While oaky and smoky, this Chardonnay is packed with fleshy tropical fruit A slightly bracing feel on the finish gives it some texture. It should pair well with weekday meals or as a pass-around wine at parties."
France,85.0,16.0,Bordeaux Blanc,SchrÃ¶der & SchÃ¿ler,"This crisply herbal wine also introduces some richer apricot flavors. A joint venture between nÃ©gociant SchrÃ¶der & SchÃ¿ler and the Barton family of LÃ©oville and Langoa Barton, it's attractive, fruity and full in the mouth. Drink now."
US,89.0,9.0,California,Ancient Roots,"Ripe but not jammy fruit flavors and firm texture make this a stand-up wine, even if it weren't such a great value. It has classic dark berry and light herb aromas, deep, fruity flavors and a big but plush mouthfeel."
France,84.0,13.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Michel Lynch,"A light wine that seems rather dilute. It has simple, green and citrus fruit flavors that are gentle and refreshing. Drink now."
US,85.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,MacMurray Estate Vineyards,"This is a light, clear and straightforward wine, reduced somewhat on the nose, and exhibiting a tight, tannic structure and backbone of oak. Black cherry and blackberry dominate in flavor, with a full-bodied feel."
France,86.0,9.0,Vin de Pays d'Oc,J. & F. Lurton,"The Lurtons get their fruit for this wine from the Carcassonne region, the coolest part of the Languedoc. That explains the simple freshness of the red fruits, the acidity and the supple but dry tannins. Screwcap."
France,86.0,10.0,Bordeaux,Les Vignerons RÃ©unis de MonsÃ©gur,"A red blend from the eastern end of the Entre deux Mers region, this is a smooth and already accessible wine. Attractive black fruits and soft tannins accompany touches of vanilla. It's ready to drink."
US,90.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"Dark pink in color, this wine offers a pleasing brightness of strawberry and grapefruit, with moderate acidity that retains body and texture. It finishes ripely succulent."
Italy,90.0,18.0,Lugana,Tenuta Roveglia,"Scents of citrus blossom, honeysuckle and white stone fruit delicately lead the way on this vibrant white. The bright refreshing palate offers Bartlett pear, creamy white peach and a hint of tangerine."
US,90.0,90.0,Stags Leap District,Martin Ray,"This 100% varietal wine from the powerful appellation delivers concentrated blackberry, tar and burnt toast flavors framed by sizable, structured tannin. Its spicy clove and tobacco seasonings persist smoothly on the finish."
US,86.0,38.0,Sonoma Valley,Haywood,"From another section of the Los Chamizal Vineyard, Morning Sun is taut in red cherry and raspberry, a citrusy component giving it lightness and zest. Leather and black pepper come to life on the finish."
Argentina,84.0,18.0,Tupungato,Finca Sophenia,"Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose, but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side, as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid."
US,91.0,35.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Bryn Mawr Vineyards,"A lovely plum shade, this blends scents and flavors of pomegranate, cherry cola, Asian spice, black licorice and a dash of cacao. It's dense and penetrating, yet drinking well already. It spent nine months in 40% new French oak."
US,83.0,15.0,Cienega Valley,Pietra Santa,"Except for a taste of cooked grapes, this is a pretty good Sangiovese. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a nice earthiness behind the cherries. But you can taste the burnt berries that just got roasted under the hot sun of this vintage."
US,84.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,Northwest Totem Cellars,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this tart and sharp-edged Washington Syrah sports bright berry fruit and just a hint of earth in the tannins. The acids are a little chalky, and there is a slight medicinal quality in the back of the mouth as the wine finishes."
France,89.0,125.0,Champagne,Jeeper,"Made from organically grown grapes, this bone-dry Champagne is steely with a tight mineral character. It offers intense acidity as well as ripe apples with a generous squeeze of lemon juice. It's fresh in the mouth and crisp at the end."
US,88.0,36.0,Dundee Hills,Vista Hills,"This wine incorporates aromas of the barnyard, along with spicy cinnamon and pepper candy. Roundly fruity with abundant cherry flavors, it's well-woven and forward, giving every indication that drinking it sooner rather than later is the right approach."
US,84.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple."
US,94.0,175.0,Napa Valley,Patland,"Juicy, dusty and wrapped in cedar, this rarefied wine is classic in nature, with highlights of pencil shavings, red currant and a dose of dried cherry. The oak is robust and supportive, offering specks of vanilla and clove, the tannins thick and tenacious, ready to mellow in time. Drink best from 2023 through 2033."
Italy,88.0,13.0,Soave Classico,Bolla,"Tufaie gets its name from the chalky tufa stone deposits that characterize its vineyard soils. That quality adds a pristine, dry quality to the wine that works very nicely with its sweet melon, sage and stone fruit aromas."
US,88.0,15.0,Central Coast,Brass Tacks,"Bone dry, with brisk tannins, this is a Merlot to drink with good food and not worry about the wine overshadowing it. It's really drinkable, with a soft, lush mouthfeel and flavors of cherries, currants, spices and cedar. A huge and welcome improvement over the '06."
France,86.0,30.0,Fronsac,ChÃ¢teau Tour Rozier,"Now reaching its maturity, this is a wine that shows tannins that have softened into spicy acidity, meaty flavors and a suggestion of wood. It is a dry wine, now ready to drink."
US,83.0,16.0,Wahluke Slope,Latah Creek,"This wine comes off as quite green especially considering the variety, vintage and appellation. Aromas of bell pepper and green herbs lead to cherry and savory flavors, with the tannins bringing some heft."
France,84.0,23.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Grand MarÃ©chaud,"High acidity cuts through this wine from the get-go. The tannins also show a hard edge. This is a wine for the future, always with a sense of austerity and minerality."
France,85.0,9.0,Alsace,Leon Beyer,"Marc Beyer has succeeded well, with a crisp, mineral style of wine that can marry well with so many fish and seafood dishes."
US,82.0,30.0,North Carolina,Biltmore Estate,"Course and snappy on the palate, this blanc de blancs features broad apple flavors."
US,90.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Buty,"Cabernet Sauvignon (85%) takes the lead on this blend, with the balance Syrah. It brings aromas of earth, green herbs, citrus and cherry that are followed by ripe cherry flavors and a firm squeeze of slightly dry tannins."
Spain,86.0,17.0,Montsant,Zerran,"This Montsant white is oily and oaky on the nose. The palate on this Garnacha Blanca is plump feeling, with decent acidity and full flavors of papaya and melon. This finishes oily in feel, with green notes and scallion flavors. Only 500 cases made."
US,85.0,13.0,Oregon,The Great Oregon Wine Company,"This nonvintage rosÃ© comes packaged in 187ml cans, with four to a pack. Lightly sugary flavors of simple strawberry fruit recall inexpensive California brands?except with a slightly tinny finish."
US,89.0,24.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Loring Wine Company,"Richly layered, the nose offers pan-fried apples, butter, vanilla, cinnamon brioche, fleshy peach and roasted nuts. The palate is action-packed with brown spice, juicy lemons and ripe cherimoya, bound by prominent acidity. Be forewarned that the wine grows overripe hours after opening."
Spain,81.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,TrencalÃ²s,"Light in color, sketchy on the nose and dilute on the palate, all of which means this has discernible issues. Bland flavors suggest grape skins, while this is flat, wheaty and yeasty tasting on the finish."
Italy,92.0,70.0,Maremma Toscana,Rocca di Frassinello,"You'll love the way this wine builds in intensity on the nose and on the palate. The blend is Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, and together the varieties deliver bright berry flavors and firm structure."
US,85.0,29.0,Oregon,Merrill Cellars,"Intended as a take on Rioja, this is noticeably volatile, dusty and loaded with chocolaty barrel flavors. Cocoa and raspberry are in the mix, but it's chocolate that runs away with the finish."
US,91.0,36.0,Sonoma Coast,Anaba,"Decisively elegant and restrained, this coastal wine is dancing in acidity and fresh green apple, a note of golden honey beckoning from beyond. Approachable and personable, it should please many palates and find a comfortable home at the table."
US,86.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,Almquist,"Spice, herb, smoke and pencil-eraser aromas lead to elegant, tart fruit flavors that don't seem to have fully ripened."
US,87.0,60.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Boudreaux Cellars,"This unusual wine offers aromas of nori, dried flowers, bittersweet chocolate and cherry cola. It's full flavored with a lightly tacky feel."
France,88.0,20.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau la Croix Blanche,"This is finely balanced wine. It has poise and bright red fruits. Underneath that are both tannins and crisp acidity. The wine is never heavy?it's well structured, finishing with swathes of fruits. Drink from late 2017."
US,92.0,29.0,Dundee Hills,Chehalem,"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth."
France,88.0,25.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau FrÃ©dignac,"A fruity wine with fresh acidity and light tannins, this is going to be ripe with a juicy character and bright tannins. After four years of conversion by Vincent and Ludivine l'Amouller, the estate's fourth generation, the 2014 vintage is now certified organic."
US,89.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Municipal Winemakers,"Pale pink in color, this primarily Grenache- and Cinsault-based rosÃ© (which also has five other grapes involved) shows light watermelon, orange rind and crushed chalk on the nose. There is buoyant citrusy energy to the sip, which goes down incredibly easy."
US,94.0,260.0,Sonoma County,VeritÃ©,"Lots going on in this mountain-grown wine. It's perfectly dry and strong in tannins, with an elusive quality of excellence that testifies to the best terroir. Showing blackberry, black cherry, mineral and oak flavors, it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next decade."
France,91.0,30.0,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,"A rounded earthiness reminiscent of Bosc pear envelops this fluid, balanced and fruit-driven wine. It conveys effortless harmony with a creamy touch that's clear and beautiful. The light approach is admirable, the clean, apple-scented finish very satisfying."
France,86.0,14.0,Vin Mousseux,Bouvet-Ladubay,"This is a soft, off-dry wine with attractive red fruit and a smooth, rounded texture. Acidity balances to give a crisp, fruity aftertaste. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Chianti,Pietro Beconcini,"This blend of 70% Sangiovese with Canaiolo, Colorino, Ciliegiolo and Malvasia shows fruity berry and violet aromas. On the palate, juicy black plum fruit is laced with baking spice and structured by smooth tannins. Enjoy soon."
US,86.0,15.0,Cayuga Lake,Knapp,"While the nose is demure, with just a touch of rose petal remniscent of GewÃ¼rztraminer, this dry white gains body and power on the palate. There's a surprising intensity of stone fruit flavor that remains through the finish."
Italy,85.0,14.0,Salento,Mocavero,"Gritty and raw with jammy fruit flavors, this Nergoamaro is very representative of the overripe, sweet style of Southern Italy. Aromas include hickory smoke, root beer, tobacco, leather and black pepper."
US,86.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,O?¢S Winery,"Mixed berry fruit flavors have an over-ripe, pruney character. A dark streak of smoke, licorice and chocolate runs straight through the core and the tannins turn a little bitter and rough. Drink now."
Spain,94.0,100.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Concentrated, intense aromas of graphite, blackberry, spice and earth notes set up a rich palate that's registering at max ripeness. Gigantic blackberry, baked black plum and toasted flavors finish dark and lush. This blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah is a big-wine lover's dream come true. Drink through 2023."
US,92.0,39.0,Anderson Valley,Pennyroyal Farm,"This new wine from the family that founded Navarro Vineyards takes a fascinating twist on Anderson Valley style, combining very concentrated, dark-fruit and black-pepper flavors on a relatively light body. It's easy to enjoy the black cherry, clove and wood-smoke notes, while feeling the lithe, moderately tannic texture lifting the mouthfeel."
US,95.0,59.0,Coombsville,Prime,"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crÃ¨me de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years."
US,87.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"Flavors of plum, cherry, cassis, chalky earth, smoke and bell pepper. Still tight and chewy, with suggestions that the fruit from this difficult vintage didn?t attain full ripeness. A good effort from a subpar year, marked by a hint of brett on the finish."
US,85.0,18.0,Wahluke Slope,Desert Wind,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this wine seems to bear more resemblance to Cabernet Sauvignon than Merlot with its notes of plum, herbs and bell pepper. The sweet cherry and vanilla flavors are buffeted by firm, dry tannins with a vanilla-filled finish."
US,93.0,75.0,Wahluke Slope,CÃ´te Nicault,"Made from 35% MourvÃ¨dre (concrete aged) and Syrah (500L French oak), with the balance Grenache (neutral French oak), this inaugural offering is captivating, with expressive notes of roasted coffee bean, dark fruit, peppery spices and chocolate. It's rich and densely flavored while still retaining some deftness, with mouthwatering acidity and enough tannic structure to lay down in the cellar for a decade or more."
Argentina,84.0,11.0,Mendoza,Trivento,"Reduced, condensed aromas of jammy berry fruits are herbal and narrow. In the mouth, this Cabernet-Malbec blend is wiry, rubbery and pinched. Flavors of prune, fig, black cherry and oregano finish blocky, with raw residual tannins."
US,93.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Benovia,"Earthy and dark fruit-driven, this is a richly rewarding, fruity wine, ripe in blackberry, clove and cocoa. From an estate vineyard named for Benovia proprietor's two mothers, Martha and Eleanor, it offers the appellation's classic elements of savory clove and cola."
Argentina,82.0,18.0,Mendoza,ViÃ±a Maipu,"Nothing much sublime about Sublimis. The nose is reedy and sweet, with licorice and overripe raisiny aromas. The palate is big and grabby, with clamp-down tannins and hard, crusty raisiny flavors. A bruising red without elegance."
US,90.0,20.0,Anderson Valley,Migration,"I love everything about this blush. It's the pretty color of a peach whose gold is turning rosy pink, and the rich flavors are of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and vanilla, all balanced with a crisp streak of acidity. Fun and serious at the same time, it will go with everything from salmon to vanilla ice cream."
US,84.0,14.0,Sonoma County,Heron,"Smells and tastes thin and stemmy, with watered down cherry and cola flavors. On the plus side, it's dry and silky."
Italy,94.0,150.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Col d'Orcia,"Combining muscle and finesse, this opens with scents that recall perfumed berry, iris, wet earth, leather and an earthy note of underbrush. The firmly structured, balanced palate offers juicy wild cherry, licorice, clove, grilled herb and a hint of toast framed in firm, mature tannins. Drink 2018??033."
France,87.0,25.0,Alsace,Domaine G. Metz,"The nose is subdued but has a floral aspect. The palate, while fresh, slender and dry, seems to have a bitter element that gets in the way of the clean citrus notes. There is some concentration and a zesty lemony finish."
France,85.0,10.0,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,"This wine is ripe, with attractive red cherry fruit flavors. It bursts with fruitiness, fresh acidity and just the lightest structure."
Italy,85.0,12.0,Soave,Tenuta Sant'Antonio,"This opens with faint honeysuckle and white stone fruit aromas. The informal, lively palate offers green apple, peach and citrus hints, alongside bright acidity."
Spain,85.0,9.0,Campo de Borja,Bodegas Aragonesas,"Cherry and black plum aromas are oaky and smoky. Full, blocky and a bit awkward on the palate, this Garnacha tastes of minty, oaky clove, roasted plum and black currant. A saucy, semi-oaked finish is solid enough."
France,86.0,18.0,Bourgogne,Domaine Gueguen,"After several years working in wine commerce and tourism, CÃ©line Guguen-Brocard in 2013 studied winemaking. This is a bright result in partnership with FrÃ©dÃ©ric Gueguen, a former winemaker for her father, and Jean-Marc Brocard. This rosÃ© is bright, crisp and full of cranberry fruit and tangy acidity. Drink now."
US,88.0,24.0,Lake County,Conn Creek,"A very light color and reserved aromas and flavors make this dry wine appetizing in a subtle way. Made from Malbec grapes, which is unusual for rosÃ©, it should pair well with seafood or almost anything you would serve a dry white wine with."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Browne Family Vineyards,"The oak?all French?is out front with notes of toast, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and spice along with peach and lemon. It's light in style with a warm finish."
US,88.0,24.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"A bright and relatively light expression of the variety, this wine imparts more red berry than black, with seasonings of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft, smooth and unfussy, it retains solid acidity from start to finish, with a taste of vanilla custard on the finish."
US,85.0,26.0,Rogue Valley,Weisinger,"Like its companion Syrah from Cedar Ridge Vineyard fruit, this is pure varietal and spent 18 months in American oak. Earthy and somewhat bitter flavors of charred wood and espresso dominate the cassis fruit. The finish is chalky and tannic."
US,88.0,8.0,Washington,Columbia Crest,"It would be hard to find a better $8 Merlot anywhere. This is soft and full-bodied, quite flavorful and fruity, with pretty black cherry fruit. Drinking especially nicely with a bit of bottle age, it finishes with well-proportioned notes of tobacco and clove."
US,87.0,20.0,Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma,Martin Ray,"Here's a good, rich Cabernet for drinking now. It satisfies for the elaborate layers of blackberries, cherries and plums, enhanced with spicy, smoky oak. Full-bodied and tannic, it shows lots of elegant complexity for the price."
France,84.0,11.0,Bordeaux,Malesan,"Smells plummy and ripe but tastes of bright cherries and shows a lean, claret-style mouthfeel. It's a little thin, but still manages to provide pleasure. Finishes with tasty mocha and toast shadings.  White Wine"
Spain,86.0,15.0,Rioja,Bodegas Franco-EspaÃ±olas,"Rooty, spicy and baked on the nose, with aromas that lean towards raisin. The palate is more gritty and acidic, with raisin, cola and spice flavors. Darkens up on the finish, which is long and peppery, with adequate juiciness and a final note of tomato."
US,91.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Aubichon Cellars,"This immaculate, fresh and beautifully defined wine is Aubichon's entry-level Pinot Noir, and sets the stage for a lovely lineup. Cranberry, cucumber, wet stone and even a faint hint of banana wreathe aromatically into a sinuous midpalate with both density and focus."
US,86.0,26.0,Willamette Valley,Cubanisimo Vineyards,"This is a light and cheery wine, with cherry and raspberry fruit. It suggests hard candy with a hint of the barnyard; forward, round and fruity."
US,93.0,30.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lincourt,"Hibiscus, rose, juniper, clove, marjoram and graphite aromas all show on the nose of this Foley family wine, which is light yet powerful in finesse and depth. Plummy fruits meet with incense, pine needle and herbal, forest-floor intrigue on the palate."
US,90.0,32.0,Bennett Valley,Matanzas Creek,"This appellation remains a standout for the variety, as evidenced by this 100% varietal wine that's mouthwatering in stone fruit and cantaloupe flavors. The aromatics center around pretty jasmine and lime zest aromas, while the palate is structured, crisp and fruity, all in good measure."
US,87.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Sequoia Grove,"A good, useful Cabernet, made for balance in large quantities from vineyards up and down the valley. It's dry, tannic and complex in blackberry, black currant, herb and new oak flavors. Drinking well now. Production was 17,843 cases."
US,82.0,18.0,Virginia,Chateau Morrisette,"Feeble scents of tropical fruit and rose petal mark the nose of this wine, which leads into the light- to medium-bodied palate that offers bright acids, soft flavors and a delicate, tapering finish."
US,86.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Fox Run,"Ripe red cherries with hints of fresh green herbs and menthol perfume both the nose and palate of this elegant, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. On the palate, intense fruit flavors gain complexity with sprinklings of olives, cedar and sturdy tannins that lead to a long, sour cherry finish."
France,87.0,59.0,Champagne,Tendil & Lombardi,"In this crisp, fresh, very dry rosÃ© Champagne, the red fruits are laced with acidity and apple. A touch of bitterness suggests the wine needs to age a few months in bottle, to soften and get a more generous feel."
US,91.0,32.0,Amador County,Fiddletown Cellars,"This is a sophisticated and ultrasmooth wine. A spicy, almost sweet aroma of classy oak leads to rich strawberry and plum flavors that glide lightly on the supple texture, which has just enough tannin and acidity to keep the wine well balanced."
US,91.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,La Crema,"From an estate site, this wine offers power and concentration. Creamy in texture, the generosity of fruit is balanced by notes of stone, toasted oak and French butter, making for a wonderfully complete experience on the palate."
US,90.0,52.0,Alexander Valley,Medlock Ames,This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.
US,83.0,19.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Bray,"Herbal and walled off by dry tannins, this Sangiovese doesn't give off the sort of food-friendly vibe others do. Instead, at 15.9% alcohol, it's a bit of a mouthful that could have benefited from a slight easing of the brake at either ripening or oaking."
US,80.0,18.0,Rogue Valley,Paschal,"Maybe southern Oregon is too hot for white wines; at least it appears to be based on this flat, rather lifeless offering. The nose is like applesauce, while the palate is bland and lazy, with only a modicum of grapefruit working in its favor. A little banana and citrus pith on the finish save it from a worse fate."
US,87.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),GÃ¥rd,"Light strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry fruit, medium weight, straight-ahead, nicely ripened. The tannins are soft and the balance works just fine."
US,91.0,35.0,Oregon,Domaine Serene,"The current edition of this nonvintage rosÃ© is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Bone-dry, tart and tangy, it's a versatile, food-friendly wine, with flavors of tart citrus flesh and rind. A dash of white pepper marks the long, full-bodied finish."
Spain,88.0,102.0,Ribera del Duero,Alion,"Some years, even the top wines suffer, and in a cold 2013, Alion is not what it normally is. For starters, this is far more tight, tannic, raw and pulling than its track record. Toasty oak is a big player, creating creamy aromas and toast on the finish. In between are crisp, peppery blackberry flavors. This wine may improve with time. Drink 2018??028."
US,92.0,100.0,Dundee Hills,Torii Mor,"Just 44 cases of this fragrant and elegant reserve were made from the estate vineyard's oldest vines; at 35 years of age they have the grace and sensuous elegance that only time can bring. Give the wine a few moments to open and up come sweet minty notes, chocolaty oak and rather delicate flavors of raspberry and pomegranate, struck against metal, mineral and earth."
US,87.0,22.0,Rogue Valley,Kriselle,"This high-toned wine's sharp, gin botanical-like aromas carry over into its flavors. Lime and other citrus notes are accented with a touch of talcum powder and some residual sweetness. Though a bit unusual, it's certainly flavorful."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Fattoria Tregole,"Violet, ripe black berry, vanilla and tilled soil aromas take center stage. The palate offers dense and juicy black cherry layered with chocolate and mocha alongside polished tannins. It's straightforward, savory and accessible. Enjoy now."
France,87.0,69.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau de la Cour,New wood flavors go over the structured fruit and give currant flavors. It is already coming into balance and is for medium-term aging. The vineyard is on the plain beneath the hill of Saint-Ãmilion.
US,87.0,30.0,Sonoma Coast,Keller Estate,"A delightful wine, softly round and mellow, with flavors of apricots, peaches, limes, honey and minerals that are accented with just-in-time acidity."
US,90.0,23.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Novelty Hill,"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish."
France,85.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Barton & Guestier,"The wine is soft and gentle, with hints of strawberry fruits and freshness. It's light, but has a crisp and spicy aftertaste."
US,90.0,57.0,Russian River Valley,Marimar Estate,"A selection of barrels from the same estate vineyard, this unctuous, brawny wine remains grippy on the palate, needing time in cellar, through 2020. Time should tame the tannins and lure in the black cherry and licorice, wrapped in luxurious swathes of blackberry and dried herb."
US,87.0,30.0,Sonoma County,Deerfield,"Dry and herbal, with tobacco, thyme and cedar flavors, and an island of wild blackberries floating in the middle. The considerable tannins make the wine astringent. Probably at its best for the next few years."
US,92.0,42.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bunchgrass,"This elegant, refined, ageworthy, pure Cabernet is sourced from the oldest vines at Windrow, which date back about two decades. There is plenty of round cherry fruit in the core of the wine, along with red plum, golden raisin, and Christmas cake spices. Cinnamon and chocolate scents waft up from the glass, nothing overblown, but exotic and compelling."
France,90.0,35.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Haut Sociondo,"This is a ripe, spicy and full-bodied wine from the Robin group of producers created by Grand Moulin's Jean-Francois Renaud in Blaye. The wine has both structure and rich blackberry fruit. The tannins are dusty, spicy and with fine acidity to balance. Drink this fine wine from 2019."
France,90.0,16.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Provence Wine Maker,This wine comes from vines south of the Mont Sainte-Victoire and close to the edge of the Aix-en-Provence region. The cool vineyard site helps the wine keep extreme freshness. Plenty of wild strawberry flavors are lifted by acidity and a refreshing citrus edge.
US,88.0,58.0,Willamette Valley,Coeur de Terre,"This single-block, one-barrel reserve is the best of the 2010 reserve Pinots from Coeur de Terre. It's medium ripe, with pretty accents of rose petals and milk chocolate, around raspberry fruit. Showing well already, it's a wine to drink young."
Spain,85.0,39.0,Ribera del Duero,Telmo RodrÃ­guez,"Expect no shortage of power and pounding tannins from this modern-styled, heavily extracted Tempranillo. The nose is dark, sweet and jammy, but all pleasantries cease there; the palate is tannic as nails, with baked plum and other roasted dark-fruit flavors. To this taster, it's a hard, tough wine. Others may find it more appealing."
France,85.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Ravoire et Fils,"Smooth and soft, this is an easy, very accessible wine. Red fruits touched by pepper and spice are cut by zesty orange and lemon flavors. It has a warm, rounded aftertaste."
France,90.0,50.0,Champagne,Lanson,"A rich wine with crisp apple and grapefruit flavors as well as a touch of sweetness, Lanson's non-vintage Brut always has fine acidity with just a hint of toast indicating some bottle age. It's bottled ready to drink."
Canada,90.0,15.0,Niagara Peninsula,Cave Spring,"This is an elegant Riesling, with pleasing, gin-like botanical scents and flavors. Along with the fresh herbs come citrus notes of Meyer lemon and Key lime, finished with a gentle hint of honey."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Rioja,Beronia,"Dry, smoky, rubbery aromas announce this Rioja as traditional in style. The palate is healthy in feel and juicy, with smoky, savory flavors of chocolaty berry fruit and earth. On the finish, it's decidedly roasted and savory in character. Drink now through 2015."
US,92.0,75.0,Carneros,Mira,"Floral and seductive on the nose, this vineyard designate from the well-loved site sizzles with acidity and dark cherry and blueberry goodness. Substantial tannins integrate well into its ripe body and fleshy texture, with dried herb and lavender accents."
US,91.0,35.0,Yakima Valley,Manu Propria,"The aromas of fresh tobacco, bittersweet chocolate, thyme, dried flowers and dark fruit are brooding and distinctive. Black-fruit flavors come tightly wrapped in firm tannins. This wine needs time in the cellar to strut its stuff. It will be best after 2020."
Spain,84.0,11.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Volver,"Medicinal berry and chocolaty oak flavors come in front of a high-acid, tartaric palate. This everyday Tempranillo tastes of oak, chocolate and slightly weedy plum. Overall, it's good enough to warrant a glass or two."
Italy,90.0,28.0,Chianti Classico,Castello della Paneretta,"Red berry, chopped herb, blue flower and menthol all come together on this elegantly structured red. The juicy, accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Drink through 2021."
US,94.0,75.0,Paso Robles,Epoch Estate Wines,"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% MourvÃ¨dre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity."
US,93.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Cloak & Dagger,"There's an elegant blend of red cherry, rose petal and purple-flower aromas on the nose of this wine. The palate is even more exquisitely layered, with espresso, dark red cherry, black plum, mission fig, North African spice and a touch of mint, all hung on a solid tannic structure."
US,90.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cooper-Garrod,"Very much done in a mineral-driven Chablis style, this interesting bottling shows a tremendous amount of flint, crushed rock and struck match on the nose, alongside dried apple and yellow-grapefruit skin. Briny oyster shells and sandstone combine with a touch of smoke on the palate. Serve with shellfish."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Patagonia,Fabre Montmayou,"This is jammy and bulky from the get-go, with heavy fruit aromas leading to a saturated, dense palate that feels thick. Baked, blackened flavors of sweet blackberry, chocolate and mocha mark the palate."
Italy,92.0,200.0,Barolo,Damilano,"Enticing scents of violet, rose, new leather, perfumed berry and aromatic herb are front and center. Full-bodied and elegant, the taut structured palate delivers morello cherry, raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. It's still youthfully austere and needs time to fully come around. Drink 2023??038."
US,87.0,38.0,Dry Creek Valley,Meeker,"Reduced and extracted, with 10% Syrah blended in, this big-boned wine imparts big tannins around a taste of boysenberry, strawberry and tobacco."
US,87.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Billsboro,"Dusty mineral and bramble notes juxtapose bright raspberry and sour-cherry notes in this full-bodied rosÃ©. Made from a blend of Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, its clingy mouthfilling texture is pleasant and plump, balanced against brisk acidity and a clean finish."
US,91.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"This delivers the best of both worlds for this aromatic grape. Crispy cut-grass notes blossom into tropical pineapple guava and green papaya. A laser focus of lime on the palate subsequently opens toward green pears, freshly cut oregano and dill, and an apple skin-driven bitterness."
Italy,85.0,12.0,Sicilia,D'Alessandro,"This Sicilian Inzolia releases fresh aromas of citrus, sage, passion fruit, pear and apple. The wine feels fresh, zippy and clean overall."
US,92.0,44.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Black Ridge,"There's a dynamic range of aromas on this wine, from dark blackberry fruit to sassafras, anise, eucalyptus, coffee and earthy loam. It's rich with nicely chalky tannins on the palate, with flavors of cooked black cherry, black tea and licorice."
France,87.0,12.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Manon la Lagune,"A year's barrel aging has given this firm and very rich wine a spicy character. That marries with the licorice and bitter chocolate to give a ripe, extracted and dense wine. It needs a few years to bring out more of the juicy plum fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
US,88.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Two Vintners,"This 100% Syrah conveys espresso, raw meat, flowers, chocolate and peppery spices. It's reserved in style with tart acids."
Italy,90.0,80.0,Rosazzo,Livio Felluga,"A blend Friulano (fermented in oak) and Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon (fermented in steel tanks), this has aromas of white fragrant flowers, subtle oak, toast and exotic fruit. The rich palate offers pear, apple, candied citrus, vanilla and butterscotch."
US,88.0,28.0,San Luis Obispo County,Last Light,"Delicate and retrained in aroma, this wine hails from an extreme coastal vineyard between Pismo Beach and the Edna Valley. With patience, Meyer lemon curd and scratched-lime elements emerge, and the flavors are also light, with more lemon and lime as well as Gala apple and Anjou pear flesh."
Italy,88.0,39.0,Toscana,Lornano,"Made with 50% Sangiovese, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of red cherry and vanilla. The palate delivers red plum, tangerine and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins."
US,84.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Pazzo,"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish."
Argentina,85.0,16.0,Mendoza,Pulenta Estate,"Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Easton,"Pungent of baked plum and baking spice, this Shenandoah Barbera is soft and rustic, yet refined, with a jolt of mocha espresso on the finish. The expert acidity enveloping this wine should pair with Mediterrean-themed food."
US,86.0,25.0,Rogue Valley,Edwin Dyer,"There's a lot going on here with notes of orange peel, fruit compote, flowers, and chocolate. It's lighter in style, showing the elegance of the 2011 vintage, with tart fruit flavors and a tacky feel to the tannins"
France,90.0,38.0,Moulin-Ã -Vent,ChÃ¢teau du Moulin-Ã -Vent,"This wine is soft and rounded, ready to drink with its rich black-fruit character and fully integrated tannins. It holds a blend from five different parcels on the estate, ripe in berry fruits and fragrant with the wood aging. Acidity gives a lift at the end."
France,94.0,150.0,Corton PerriÃ¨res,Louis Latour,"Structured and dense, this wine comes from the remains of a quarry on the hill of Corton. From the Louis Latour domaine, it is powerful and packed with black fruits, rich while still with the freshness of the year. It has a good future, so don't drink before 2023."
US,92.0,40.0,Willamette Valley,Harper Voit,"The most affordable of Harper Voit's 2013 lineup, this deeply aromatic wine offers up a lush mix of rose petals and other perfumed floral scents, along with hints of rhubarb and cherry. Elegant on the palate, it's a poised and balanced wine that brings to mind the old line about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, only backwards and in high heels. Here the dance includes ripe strawberries, cherries, flowers and a long, graceful encore."
US,89.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"This wine is equal parts Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. Cabernet takes the lead on the aromas, with notes of dark cherry and dried herbs along with hints of toast, coffee and cocoa. The elegant milk chocolate and cherry flavors are brightened by the Sangiovese's tart acidity."
US,88.0,15.0,North Fork of Long Island,Lieb,"Honeydew and mango notes lend tropical flair to apple and pear flavors in this fruit-forward, easy drinking Chardonnay. Dry and medium bodied in style, it's balanced by a stream of zesty lime acidity and a touch of saline mineral on the finish."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Umbria,Argillae,"Made from Grechetto, a grape widely planted in parts of Umbria, this opens with aromas of apricot, tropical fruit and citrus. The delicious palate offers crisp acidity and flavors of ripe peach, cantaloupe, lemon zest, almond and thyme."
Italy,87.0,27.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Sartori,"Compared to the 2003 vintage, the fruit is slightly more vibrant and polished here. There's also a slightly green note of herb or dill that we didn't notice in the past. The mouthfeel is, however, bright, crisp and refreshingly informal."
US,89.0,18.0,Washington,Raconteur,"Two-thirds Chenin Blanc and one-third GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, this wine opens with aromas of apple, white pepper, herb and spice. It brings a sense of freshness and purity, along with a rounded feel."
Italy,93.0,75.0,Barbaresco,Castello di Neive,"Here is a very elegant and smooth wine that leaves a silky, polished impression in the mouth. It awards the nose with bright aromas of wild berry, licorice and toasted almond. It's simple, genuine and sophisticated all at once."
US,86.0,13.0,Mendocino,Girasole,"Packaged in an attractive sunflower-adorned screwcap bottle, this Chardonnay made from organic grapes is light, bright and straightforward?tasting of lemon, lime and kiwi?with barely any oak influence."
US,84.0,40.0,Wahluke Slope,Mas Chappell,"Volatile aromas are backed by abundant strawberry and cherry notes. The palate packs a mouthful of bold and puckering dried-cranberry flavors, backed by lightly astringent tannins."
US,88.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Michael Florentino Cellars,"Winemaker Michael Haddox is exploring unusual, emerging grape varieties in Washington State. This well-made Malbec is just the start, showing dried cherry fruit, graham cracker toast, and hints of stone and graphite. It's chewy and muscular, an interesting debut for the winery."
US,90.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"Made with 63% Syrah and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Shaw vineyards, this appealing offering brings notes of plum, smoke and blue fruit. It's full bodied, plush and ripe in feel, with silky tannins supporting coffee and blue fruit flavors. A guaranteed crowd pleaser."
US,88.0,11.0,California,Morro Bay,"For a wine that's been made with a soft touch but still has some weight and finesse, this is a great value. It opens with aromas of ripe peach fuzz and crisp apple, a nice intermingling of flavors. Lemon and grapefruit rind flavors shine on the finish."
France,85.0,25.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Moulin de Canhaut,"On the austere side, this shows more tannin than fruit, based around a dry core that has spread through the wine. There is some black plum skin and black currant fruit, but it is hard to find."
US,86.0,30.0,Chehalem Mountains,Dauntless,"A reductive note of rubber tire threads through the mÃ©lange of cherry cola, iron ore and red licorice flavors in this wine. The components have not yet integrated, leading to a finish marked by bitter skin and tannins. Give it another couple of years of bottle age before pulling the cork."
US,87.0,28.0,Knights Valley,Lawer,"Dull and reduced on the nose, this wine grows earthy and hearty in the glass as it opens, offering a mix of leather, black pepper, coffee and baked plum flavors."
US,87.0,22.0,Alexander Valley,Clos du Bois,"One of the most pleasurable Clos du Bois Cabernets in years, this is easy to enjoy now for its flavors of cherries, currants, tobacco, spices and smoky oak."
US,84.0,5.0,California,Mancan,"This wine's intense grapey, jammy aromas lead to very fruity and blackberry jam, melted butter and strawberry syrup flavors. It's medium bodied and sweet."
US,92.0,65.0,St. Helena,Tudal,"Heavy, oaky and fruity now, but it's a young Cabernet, and all the signs point to ageability. The tannins are firm, in the way of Napa, the acidity is just right, and the core consists of massive black currant and cassis flavors, with a fine minerality adding to the structure. The winemaker is the brilliant Kirk Venge.  Drink 2017 and beyond."
Argentina,85.0,20.0,Mendoza,Cruz Alta,"Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors. Easygoing in terms of feel, with a creamy, sweet finish. A typical South American tropical Chardonnay."
US,86.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Silverado,"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained."
US,91.0,42.0,Sonoma Coast,Lombardi,"Sourced from the 3 Starrs Vineyard planted to the Wente clone, this white is lovely. A generous presence of oak and power evolves in the glass to offer a more balanced expression of Gravenstein apple, fig and tangerine. Lengthy, it impresses in its gravelly texture of crushed stone."
Argentina,90.0,20.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Trapiche is doing all sorts of experiments with terroirs and soils, and this Malbec is from vineyards planted on top of clay. On the nose, it's oaky, with notes of clove, mint and barrel spice accenting black-fruit scents. A full chewy palate deals spicy oaky minty blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty finish with wood spice and minty berry notes. Drink through 2019."
US,87.0,14.0,California,Bonterra,"This light, fruity and refreshing wine is made from organic grapes and pairs nicely with linguine and clams or pizza bianca. Although matured in French oak barrels, it's more delicate than usual, tasting of apples, baking spice and fresh lemon."
US,91.0,93.0,Napa Valley,Grgich Hills,"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Campania,Mastroberardino,"Mastroberardino has created an easygoing Aglianico with defined aromas of wild berry, spice, resin and black pepper. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth with a streamlined feel and a crisp, bright finish."
Argentina,89.0,19.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,ViÃ±a Alicia,"Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a good feel and tannins that melt away, while the flavors of black cherry and cassis lean toward medicinal but don't fully go there. Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish."
US,88.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of blue fruit, herb, pencil lead and barrel spice are followed by smooth plum flavors. Milk chocolate notes persist on the finish."
France,84.0,20.0,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,"This is a simple, soft wine which has some sweetness as well as easy fruit. There is some perfume and a spicy edge as well as rounded orange flavor. Drink now."
France,88.0,42.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Georges Duboeuf,"This mango-flavored wine is ripe, generous and fruity. Its richness and spice are right up front. It is a gorgeous wine, smooth, creamy and ready to drink."
France,85.0,19.0,Menetou-Salon,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste."
US,85.0,10.0,Monterey County,Fetzer,"Apple cider, night jasmine, ripe pears and orange cream aromas show on this sweeter bottling. The palate is quite clean and crisp, with rich apple juice flavors and a tactile acidity that fades fairly quickly. It's quite sweet."
US,90.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Black Stallion,"Moderate acidity and a low imprint of oak allow the voluptuous fruit to speak in this vineyard-designated white, a show of pretty aromatics and ripe, succulent peach. Along the streaks of more fulsome vanilla appear brighter, crisper hints of lime zest and lemon meringue."
US,87.0,14.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Cameron Hughes,"Black cherry, roasted meats, turned loam and a little bit of gingerbread make for a very inviting nose to this bottling. Clay and wet earth flavors kick off the palate, followed by touches of forest floor and dried red cherry."
US,87.0,11.0,California,First & Local,"Complexity in terms of both fruit flavors and oak-induced spices make this wine fun to taste. It has light baking-spice aromas, ripe fruit flavors like black cherry, and a lightly tannic texture."
US,86.0,30.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gainey,"Gainey's basic Pinot is dry, dark in color and a little heavy. It has cherry, cola, licorice, white pepper and smoky oak flavors, and the tannins are thick. Lacks the vibrancy normally associated with this winery."
France,89.0,55.0,Fronsac,ChÃ¢teau Jeandeman,"Dominated by Merlot at 90%, this is a smooth, rich and generous wine. It does have a tannic core, but that is surrounded by these velvet, ripe berry fruits and opulent texture. The wine is developing well and should be drunk from 2016."
US,84.0,10.0,North Coast,Napa Ridge,"Soft, fruity and simple, a somewhat bitter wine marked by cherry, cola and herb flavors. Turns supple and silky on the finish."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore,Fattoria Zerbina,"This Sangiovese from central Italy offers a very fresh and vibrant quality of fruit that is expressed as cherry, blackberry and sour plum. It's a simple, one-dimensional wine and its best attribute is precisely that."
US,87.0,23.0,Anderson Valley,Husch,"Finding a good Anderson Valley Pinot Noir for under $25 is no easy feat and so this Husch bottling is impressive in delivering a fairly good experience for the price. A tad chewy still, with an oaky presence, it shows dark, ripe strawberry and mushroom-y flavors and finishes with some spice."
France,84.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Suau,The wine has ripe yellow fruit flavors that are soft and full. Spice and a generous texture give a rounded wine that is full bodied and ready to drink.
Italy,89.0,38.0,Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,Le Colture,"This is a very feminine sparkler with a beautiful bouquet of fresh white rose and jasmine. It has a delicate, pulpy consistency and would pair well with zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella cheese."
US,90.0,100.0,Moon Mountain District Sonoma County,Kunde,"From the mountains above the winery, this blends 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Cabernet Franc, 24% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. The result is a harmonious palate of dried herb, cedar and pungent violet flavors. Full-bodied concentration makes it rugged, accented with toasted oak."
US,87.0,30.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Manzoni,"Ripe and oaky, this will appeal to those who love their Chards voluptuous. It's strong in buttered toast, caramelized wood, sweet-and-sour pineapple candy and lemondrop flavors."
France,88.0,33.0,Sauternes,ChÃ¢teau d'Arche,"Crisp with acidity and ripe with apricot flavors, this is a finely perfumed wine. A core of botrytis hints at future richness. Now, it boasts bitter orange notes and a bright finish."
Spain,92.0,92.0,Rioja,Pujanza,"Opaque in color, with reduced aromas of mushroom, rubber and so forth. But do not give up on this masculine bruiser; it will loosen up with air and offer plum, leather and chocolate flavors that are nothing short of excellent. And while it's a touch zesty at its core, the wine still mixes in enough coffee and richness to make it a modern-style success story."
US,90.0,30.0,Alta Mesa,Wise Villa,"This bright and attractive dry wine has exotic floral and pistachio aromas, rich grapefruit and rosewater flavors, and a lively texture that seems to keep the flavors tripping over the tongue on the aftertaste. It will be a real treat for brunch or with spicy food."
US,93.0,50.0,Santa Barbara County,Jaffurs,"There's a warm and welcoming note of baked goods and toasty brioche on the nose of this bottling, along with hints of vanilla and black cherry. The flavors are also very accessible and delicious, with black-cherry syrup, maple, brown sugar and more vanilla spice that carries deep into the finish. The tannins are firm enough to hold up the richness."
France,89.0,15.0,Alsace,Willm,"Peach and honeysuckle send very subtle evocative aromas on the nose. On the palate, real spice becomes apparent: pepper as well as grapefruit. The full fruit approach on the medium-sweet palate fully benefits from that grapefruit edge: this is balanced, refreshing and moreish. Drink while aromas are at their peak."
US,93.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"With a small percentage of whole-cluster fermentation, this is a prized, sultry and cohesive wine, nutty in aromas and a sizable pinch of oak that speaks to its youthfulness. Raspberry jam and bitter tea ride over soft waves of integrated tannin and a fierce earthiness. Drink now through 2024."
US,82.0,18.0,Sonoma County,Alexander Valley Vineyards,"Simple and fruity and forward, though still unbalanced from extreme youth. It's more like a Beaujolais nouveau, with an odd, disjointed, watery finish. The price seems way out of line for what's in the bottle."
US,91.0,32.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tulpen,"This wine is 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and a whopping 27% Petit Verdot, with the fruit coming from Yellow Bird and Tokar vineyards. Brooding aromas of freshly tilled soil, dried flowers, herbs and cherry lead to a richly flavored but well-balanced palate. It should age well."
US,88.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Landmark,"There's a fresh, juicy sense of dark cherry and cranberry in this medium-bodied wine. A lurking forested, mushroomy earthiness hovers around it as well, the finish awash in rich, dark toasty oak accented by notes of chocolate."
US,90.0,20.0,Mendocino County,Atrea,"Light but enticing jasmine and honeydew melon flavors give this full-bodied, dry wine a lot of personality, and the mouthfeel is just rich enough to coat the palate and help the finish linger. It's crafted from 70% Viognier and 30% Roussanne."
US,88.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Darby,"In the nose, this 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec, 10% Merlot, 5% Cab Franc blend offers a plush mix of black cherry, cassis and black olive. There is a slight hint of tanned leather, but not enough to dampen the sweet fruit. Smooth and open, forward and just plain delicious."
US,92.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Brian Carter Cellars,"While Petit Verdot is often relegated to being a minor blending component, it makes up a full 51% of this wine with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. High-toned, locked-up aromas of herbs, flowers, tobacco and cocoa are followed by fruit flavors backed by lively acids and firm but well-integrated tannins."
US,88.0,17.0,Russian River Valley,Frei Brothers,"Stony lemon and a twist or two of grass dot zesty acidity in this clean, crisp and focused white, sure to be a pleasurable quaffer."
Spain,89.0,40.0,Rioja,Bodegas Muriel,"Tobacco, mocha, lemony oak and red-fruit aromas comprise a good, traditional Rioja bouquet. The mouthfeel is pinched and raw, while herb, tomato and dried raspberry flavors carry the palate to an earthy, mossy conclusion. Drink this very good Rioja now through 2018."
US,90.0,18.0,Oregon,J. Scott Cellars,"Not such a rarity these days, AlbariÃ±o is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white."
Argentina,86.0,12.0,Mendoza,Septima,"Value-level Chardonnay has never really been Argentina's strong suit, but this fuller-bodied version is pretty good. It starts with citrus, orange peel and some dusty scents, which are backed by melon, apple and citrus flavors. It finishes with some pithy bitterness but overall it's nice for Mendoza Chardonnay."
US,86.0,39.0,Napa Valley,Prime,"This inaugural release is pretty good, made in the international or cult style of softness, extreme ripeness and early palate appeal. It's forward in jammy cherry, black currant and plum flavors."
US,93.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"An impressive blend of different vineyard sites, given a touch less oak than many of the producer's single-vineyard selections, this wine doesn't skimp on flavor nor complexity. It weaves steely minerality into warmer layers of nutmeg, apple and preserved lemon."
Spain,91.0,30.0,Rioja,CVNE,"Lightly charred and oaky on first take, this traditional Rioja features vanilla scents on top of red plum and raspberry aromas. A juicy, fresh, tight palate tastes of old-school American oak blended with plum, raspberry and woodspice. A dry, juicy, peppery finish is fitting for this wine. Drink through 2021."
Argentina,89.0,39.0,La Consulta,Altocedro,"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now."
US,90.0,38.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lincourt,"Tar, boysenberry and beef char show on this very dark expression of Syrah, which is still tightly wound. There is great intensity to the palate, where fire-roasted black plums and elderberries create a rustic quality."
France,85.0,20.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau du Taillan,"This is a bright, fruity, rounded wine with a soft texture. It's full and ripe, with melon and green plum notes, plus a touch of bitterness on the finish."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Baricci,"Enticing, classic Sangiovese aromas of fragrant blue flower, wild berry, underbrush and a whiff of tilled earth lift out of the glass. The bright, supple palate offers crushed red cherry, anise and white pepper alongside zesty acidity and lithe tannins."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Umbria,Perticaia,"Here's a simple but well-made and enjoyable offering made from a blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Merlot. The linear palate offers up bright cherry-berry, licorice and mint, along with firm tannins and fresh acidity."
US,87.0,35.0,North Fork of Long Island,Lieb,"Waxy lemon and apple skin aromas meld with spring blossoms on this bright, citrusy Pinot Blanc sparkling. While it's aggressively foamy, sunny tangerine acidity shines on the palate. Finishes crisply on a zesty lemon note."
US,90.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Stewart,"A little ungainly now, with stiff tannins and lots of fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit colliding with unintegrated oak notes. All the parts are there, but they need until 2019??020 to meld."
US,89.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Martin Ranch,"Give this young puppy a few years to shed its babyfat. It's a bit tannic and hard now, although the blackberry, currant and cedar flavors are just fine. But it's not a longterm ager due to some raisining."
US,93.0,100.0,Willamette Valley,Ponzi,"This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding. Dark cherry and cassis fruit is packed with iron filings, coffee grounds and black licorice. Winemaker Luisa Ponzi does her usual excellent job of putting the polish on outstanding fruit. Give it another decade and it will show its best."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Fiano di Avellino,Rocca del Principe,"It conveys a lightly floral, herbaceous fragrance. The palate is more restrained than exuberant, offering juicy pineapple, citrus, pink grapefruit and mineral accented with sage and rosemary."
US,88.0,21.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton Estate,"A refreshing wine, tart in acidity, with savory green leaf, gooseberry and tropical fruit flavors. Feels really clean and zesty in the mouth, finishing with a swirl of exotic spices."
US,91.0,35.0,Finger Lakes,Shaw,"Bold strokes of blackberry, cassis and bramble persist throughout this surprisingly youthful late-release Cabernet Sauvignon. It's rich on the palate yet balanced neatly, boasting brisk acidity and ripe but grippy tannins. Two years of maturation in French oak contribute to a long finish marked with sweet tobacco and baking spices."
US,87.0,14.0,Northern Sonoma,Rodney Strong,"Nice and easy to drink, with sweetened orange tea, lime, vanilla, honey and white pepper flavors, brightened with zesty acidity."
France,89.0,40.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Alex Gambal,"With a good sense of structure, this bottling, formerly called Vieilles Vignes, comes from 55-year-old vines. It is textured, with some firm tannins as well as ripe plum flavors and acidity. The wine is still developing and will be better from 2016."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Cava,SÃ niger,"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity."
US,90.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Swiftwater Cellars,"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, flowers, herbs and black cherry. The flavors are velvety and smooth, carrying through on the finish."
Italy,89.0,16.0,Falanghina del Beneventano,Villa Raiano,"Delicately scented, this offers aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and pear while the round, juicy palate doles out white peach, mature apple and Mediterranean herb. A hint of almond closes the clean, lingering finish."
US,91.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"Aromatically, this wine is currently subdued, with the notes of raspberry, cocoa and cherry that haven't fully blossomed. The flavors meanwhile are generous and ripe, while still showing a fine sense of balance. Additional time in the bottle or a long decant should allow it to open up."
US,93.0,90.0,Carneros,Donum,"Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020."
US,93.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Patz & Hall,"Juicy and earthy, this lovely appellation wine is voluptuous with a spicy thread. Blueberry and huckleberry fruit meld seamlessly into savory bites of tree bark and forest as the whole offers length and breadth."
Italy,93.0,140.0,Vin Santo del Chianti Rufina,Fattoria di Grignano,"From the distant 1994 vintage, this Vin Santo blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia has been aged an astonishing 15 years in small oak barrel. You can detect some of that evolution on the bouquet thanks to aromas of dried apricot, marron glacÃ©, maple syrup and candied fruit with cinnamon spice. It's a sweet, thick wine with great intensity and the potential to age many more years to come."
US,85.0,27.0,Paso Robles,Tablas Creek,"Easy to like, with gentle, soft flavors of apricot jam, ripe pear, vanilla and honeysuckle. Tastes like there may be some residual sugar, making it a nice afternoon cocktail wine."
US,86.0,17.0,Russian River Valley,Bearboat,"An easy, gentle red wine, full-bodied and spicy, with extravagantly ripe cherry and blackberry flavors. Pretty good, but lacks those extra layers of complexity, so drink now."
France,85.0,15.0,Bordeaux,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite),"A black currant-dominated wine, with a stalky, herbal series of flavors along with a positive juicy, fruit-forward character. The tannins are firmly dry with some smoky spice at the end."
Italy,84.0,13.0,Piave,Pizzolato,"Here's an easygoing Pinot Grigio that does a good job at keeping your palate refreshed. The structure is thin and watery and the wine offers aromas of peach, pear and white flower. But the acidity is there and that's what you need for salads and appetizers. Good price tag too."
US,89.0,25.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Thurston Wolfe,"Only two barrels were made of this pure Malbec, a tightly wound wine with a well-defined mix of berry, bramble, bark and herb. It shows good balance and good length, with a finish that's streaked with notes of coffee and chocolate."
Italy,90.0,22.0,Vittoria,Planeta,"Red berry, rose and clove are some of the aromas you'll find on this bright, supple red. The smooth palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity. A mineral vein underscores the savory flavors and energizes the finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018."
US,82.0,15.0,California,Seven Daughters,"Everything about this wine is admirable except for the concentration. It's dry and crisp with acidity, but only delicately flavored with citrus, pears, honey and vanilla bean."
US,94.0,65.0,Paso Robles,Falcone,"Plump blackberry and ripe black cherries meet with caramel sauce and a hint of slate on this nonvintage exploration of Petite Sirah, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. A sip reveals blackberry, dark chocolate, cola and a bit of smoke flavorings, proving plush yet brisk, ripe yet restrained with a rocky minerality."
France,94.0,90.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau Duhart-Milon,"This marks an impressive step forward for this wine that's so often been in the shadows of other wines in the Lafite-Rothschild stable. It's dense and structured as well as deliciously fruity. The wine is straight down the line, starting with perfumed acidity and finishing with blackberry fruit. Intense and tannic, it's likely to age. Drink from 2020."
US,88.0,22.0,Sonoma Coast,Kendall-Jackson,"Held back probably to tame fierce acidity, and it's still a young, lean, tart wine. Fresh, juicy flavors of lemons drink very clean and vibrant, but it's austere stuff. Try with goat cheese on toast."
France,94.0,149.0,Volnay,Domaine Jacques Prieur,"This monopole (single owner vineyard) has produced a wine of great depth and concentration, packed with black fruits, berries and a smoky wood character. It's an impressive wine, very rich and with sufficient layered acidity. Very ageworthy."
US,84.0,26.0,Sonoma Valley,Gundlach Bundschu,"Super-fruity, with jammy flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches and spicy golden mango. A bit sugary sweet, too."
Italy,88.0,13.0,Maremma,Rascioni e Cecconello,"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Ciliegiolo, this has blue flower and underbrush fragrance. The earthy, straightforward palate delivers black cherry, thyme and white pepper flavors, held together with smooth tannins. There's lots to enjoy here, but drink soon."
US,89.0,39.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),College Cellars,"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it."
US,92.0,55.0,Dundee Hills,Trisaetum,"This is a new cuvÃ©e for Trisaetum, from a vineyard in the Red Hills of Dundee. It shows some old vine character in its brambly, Burgundian elegance. Light flavors of raspberry and cherry float above a bed of clay, yet there is enough muscle for the wine to extend gracefully through a lingering finish, with a lick of chocolate. Enjoy it over the next decade or more."
US,87.0,39.0,Napa Valley,Mumm Napa,"There is 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay in this sparkling Brut. Golden-apple in color, it offers flavors and aromas that follow suit, rich in ripe apple, hazelnut and chestnut with a layering of natural sweetness on the finish."
US,92.0,75.0,Chehalem Mountains,Blakeslee,"The Sheila reserve is a block and barrel selection, and brings an extra dollop of fruit concentration when compared side-by-side with the other estate reserve. Both are wines of immaculate detail, here with a lush mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit, augmented with streaks of cola and red licorice. The balance and length are impressive."
France,91.0,32.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Guy Saget,"A full, ripe wine, with delicious white plum, sweet grapefruit and a tense mineral edge. There is a great texture from fruit tannins, boosted by intense shots of acidity. Age for another year or two."
US,86.0,20.0,Carmel Valley,Holman Ranch,"This wine never saw any oak. What you get is what the grapes contributed, which is pure, intense tangerine and lime fruit, brightened with brisk acidity. It's a chiseled wine, but there's a streak of honey that relieves it."
US,87.0,29.0,Arroyo Seco,Cobblestone,"A little pricey for the quality, but still, this is a super-drinkable Chardonnay. It's semi-sweet and brisk in acidity, with a cut of minerality supporting ripe orange, pineapple, vanilla and buttered toast flavors."
US,82.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Epiphany,"Epiphany's varietal '04s weren't very good, so how could this MourvÃ¨dre, Grenache and Syrah blend be? It's dry, tannic and dull, with thin, barely ripe flavors."
US,93.0,80.0,Santa Maria Valley,Cambria,"This small-production Pinot is ripe and intense. It immediately strikes you with the sheer opulence of its cherry and blueberry flavors. But the structure is immaculate, with pure, refined tannins, plus bright, zesty acids. It has a lot of alcohol, and the wine is a bit warm, but Pinot-friendly foods like steak and lamb will help to balance it. Drink now??016."
US,86.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Vista Hills,"An interesting experiment, this Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for six months. It's a pale rose color, and the skin contact has resulted in some quite puckery phenolics. The barrel aging helps round it out, though it remains almost sour, with light, astringent strawberry fruit."
Spain,85.0,10.0,CariÃ±ena,MarquÃ©s de Almonacid,"Gritty plum, peppery spice and herbal aromas lead to a tangy, fairly high-acid palate. The flavors are a mix of earthiness, pasty berry and red currant, while the finish is short, juicy and lightly oaked. For $10 it's a fair wine."
France,90.0,15.0,Bordeaux,Cheval Quancard,"Celebrating the foundation of Cheval Quancard in 1844, this is a solid, dense and well-made wine from ripe grapes. The balance is good with tannins already integrating well into the juicy, ripe acidity. It's ready to drink but will age at least until 2019."
US,87.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,WesMar,"Light and carbonic in tone, with a slight spritz to the acidity, this wine is ethereal, laced with black tea and tart cranberry flavors."
Argentina,84.0,11.0,Mendoza,Nieto Senetiner,"Hard cherry and spice aromas are varietally correct, while the palate is standard in feel, with toasty, creamy flavors of sweet berry. Has enough acidity and vibrancy to rank as juicy on the finish."
Italy,84.0,8.0,Prosecco,Banero,"There is only a handful of Kosher sparkling Proseccos out there, and this is one of them. Lively and bright, the wine shows citrus, stone fruit and dried hay aromas."
Australia,90.0,22.0,Margaret River,Stella Bella,"This wine's subtle underpinnings of smoke, toasted hazelnuts and baking spices add layers of interest to the melon and citrus fruit. This is medium to full bodied and just a bit creamy on the palate, making it a nicely balanced, all-around solid Chardonnay for drinking over the next few years."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Barolo,Grimaldi Bruna,"Mature berry, blue flower, toasted oak and a whiff of cake spice lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate offers stewed cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla, espresso and a licorice note alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a drying finish. It closes on a raisin note."
US,93.0,36.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Sineann,"Focused, deep and rich, this lovely vineyard designate is dotted with notes of charcoal, caramel and mocha. It offers both power and finesse, a rare combination, with persistent flavors, anchored on a substantial core of raspberry and cherry fruit. Drink now through 2026."
Spain,87.0,31.0,Ribera del Duero,O. Fournier,"Tight and gritty on the bouquet, with licorice and herbal aromas. Comes across hard and tannic in the mouth, with blackberry and herbal flavors. Tannic like nails on the finish, with lemony oak notes."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Toscana,Montebelli,"This is an organically farmed blend of Sangiovese (80%) and Syrah (20%) with elegant mineral tones at the back of red berry, smoke and campfire. Elegance and harmony stand out here and the flavors are smoky and ashy."
US,88.0,16.0,Paso Robles,MCV,"This is a big, rich rosÃ©, and a very delicious one. With fairly high alcohol, it's full-bodied, with complex flavors of orange peel, peach, watermelon, vanilla and spices. Perfect with paella or anything with ham."
Spain,88.0,16.0,Cava,Paul Cheneau,"A little bit round given that it's a blanc de blancs, with applesauce and spice on the nose. The palate deals a white-fruit mÃ©lange that's one part tangy and one part generous. Holds steady on the finish and doesn't show any warts or faults. Nice Cava with an elevated persona."
Argentina,86.0,8.0,San Juan,Mariposa,"This clean, mild quaffer offers basic white-fruit aromas and a light-bodied, fresh palate. Apple and mild citrus flavors are short on the finish, which takes on an apricot flavor as it fades away."
US,91.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Kaleidos,"Aromas of maple and sweet hickory smoke emerge through the waves of purple fruit and lilacs on the nose of this small-batch blend of 52% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 21% MourvÃ¨dre. The flavors are well integrated on the sip, with tangy boysenberry, a pinch of sage and crushed black-pepper spice, with a strong acidity that rises in the midpalate."
Argentina,86.0,11.0,Mendoza,Tilia,"This is herbal and clipped smelling, with a scattering of berry and plum notes. It feels saturated and chewy, with roasted berry, pepper and spice flavors that lead to a lightly herbal finish, with a rubbery accent and a baked fruit note."
US,85.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Armanino Family Cellars,"This is a soft and sweet effort. It's a good wine, with raspberry and cherry jam flavors. This bottling from Armanino has been inconsistent over the years."
US,90.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Clos du Bois,"Made claret style, the fruit and alcohol are restrained, and the wine drinks dry and balanced. Dark cherry and wild berry flavors are mouth-filling and the tannins are complex but approachable. This is a fine example of its appellation and terroir."
US,88.0,18.0,Anderson Valley,JoletÃ©,"This wine keeps true to the varietal character of German Riesling, with an aroma of petrol?that British term that describes Riesiing's oddly attractive and mild diesel smell?plus peach and green apple. It tastes crisp, dry, medium-bodied and well balanced."
US,92.0,125.0,Oakville,Aiken,"A study in dusty tannins and crisp, classic cassis and cranberry, this wine offers plenty of the beloved herbaceousness of old-school Cabernet, along with a soft-hearted structure and compelling notes of violet and soy. Medium-bodied, it's enjoyable now but has the legs to age through 2026."
France,88.0,45.0,CÃ´tes du Roussillon,Agly Brothers,"Notes of olive and bay leaves add some interesting complexity to the nose of this blend, otherwise dominated by typical red berry flavors. Ripe and rich on the palate with medium acidity and lighter tannins. The finish, dominated by beautiful notes of wild strawberries, is long and satisfying."
France,88.0,27.0,Moulin-Ã -Vent,ChÃ¢teau du Moulin-Ã -Vent,"This wine is all about red berries and fresh cherries. Some tannins and an earthy edge to the palate add complexity. Drink this fruity, juicy wine now."
US,92.0,55.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Tudor Wines,"Offering aromas of a warm berry cobbler with a touch of sagebrush spice, this delivers the flavorful balance promised by the appellation. Once sipped, there is violet, lavender, cola, rhubarb pie and candy-coated fennel seeds, a combination that comes across as uncomplicated and makes for easy, delicious drinking."
US,84.0,19.0,Shenandoah Valley,Shenandoah Vineyards,"Smelling this wine is like sticking your nose into a jar of turmeric, with added aromas of ground coffee bean and broad black fruit that shade in the background. While the turmeric note remains dominant on the palate, the wine would pair well with spicy curry dishes?especially considering its modest 12% alcohol."
US,91.0,45.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Andrew Will,"Though Andrew Will has been known more recently for its vineyard-designated blends, this is a return to a 100% varietal offering. Coming from five year-old vines, it shows grace and texture with high toned leafy notes, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and plum. There's a wonderful sense of tension between the lively acidity and the chewy tannins as the wine continues to open and evolve."
US,85.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Fritz,"On the sweet side, with sugary, jammy pineapple, tangerine and vanilla flavors. There's a good bite of acidity, but the wine still tastes candied."
Australia,85.0,8.0,South Eastern Australia,Black Swan,"Nice floral, pear and vanilla notes waft from the nose. Its body is on the soft side, but the sweetish, white stone fruit-and-citrus profile (and its bargain price) are surefire crowd pleasers."
US,91.0,85.0,Rutherford,PiÃ±a,"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here."
US,90.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This succulent effort proves once again that a hot site can make excellent Riesling in Washington state. The Cold Creek signature minerality provides the base, and the fruit, vibrant and fresh, brings juicy acidity as well. The wine sails into a creamy finish that demands a glass refill."
France,84.0,12.0,Bergerac Sec,ChÃ¢teau Laulerie,"This fresh, vibrant wine is light and fruity. A classic blend of Sauvignon Blanc and SÃ©millon, it has an herbal character along with bright green and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink."
US,88.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,The Divining Rod,"Marc Mondavi, who is the eldest son of the late Peter Mondavi, has a reputation as a bona fide water witch, hence the name of his wine project. This is his first venture into Oregon, and it's a welcome addition to the growing ranks of value Pinots from the Willamette Valley. Elegant and affordable, it's loaded with soft, accessible cherry and chocolate flavors, smooth as silk."
Italy,85.0,14.0,Venezia,Tenuta Polvaro,"Bright citrus and bitter almond give this a sharp, tonic personality. Pair this easy, food-friendly wine with sushi or Thai food."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Barbera d'Alba,Pelassa,"This is a plush and upfront wine that offers succulent aromas of cherry, black fruit and plum. It glides clean down the palate thanks to its thick density and soft, smooth texture. The wine has the pulp and density to pair with most winter foods."
US,92.0,22.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Santa Barbara Winery,"This is an elaborate, oaky Chardonnay made in the popular style that has made California Chard such a success. It's rich in pineapple jam, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla and leesy flavors, and grows better as it warms in the glass."
Argentina,86.0,18.0,Agrelo,Manos Negras,"Aromas of vanilla and Animal crackers are light on fruit. Delicate on the palate, this offers lychee and tropical fruit flavors that suggest TorrontÃ©s. A pithy finish is braced by bright acidity."
France,94.0,125.0,Chambolle-Musigny,Alex Gambal,"Aux Echanges is one of the smallest Premier Crus in Chambolle on the northern end close to Morey Saint-Denis, an area that gives a firm character to the wine. The structure is all there with some solid tannins although the wine also has superripe red fruits that are delicious and jammy. Full in the mouth, it is still young, so drink from 2019."
France,83.0,11.0,Pays d'Oc,ChÃ¢teau Guilhem,"Baby powder and carnation grace the ummy peach and strawberry fruit tones in this wine. It's a touch sharp through the close, while mealy fruit dominates the palate."
US,88.0,35.0,Red Mountain,Liberty Lake,"Aromas of vanilla, pickling spices, green pepper and dark fruit are followed by tart cherry flavors. It shows both the elegance of the vintage and the power of the appellation."
France,88.0,11.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Sorin,"Darker in color than many Provence rosÃ©s, this caramel-flavored wine has a fine line in ripe berry fruits to go with the smooth, velvet texture. Dry in style, its firm texture is right for food."
US,88.0,13.0,Willamette Valley,Lujon,"Still young and lightly spritzy, this fruity and well-rounded take on Pinot Gris seems to have more than a subtle hint of sweetness. The pretty pear and apple fruit is lightly spicy and spent four months sur lie, all stainless."
Spain,93.0,45.0,Jumilla,El Nido,"An intense bouquet with resiny oak, coconut, fig, prune and blackberry aromas is staunch and heady. This is yet another lush, deep, high-alcohol wine from the Gil family. Baked black-fruit flavors register at max ripeness, while flavors of coffee, chocolate and toast push the finish on this flamboyant Monastrell blend. Drink through 2020."
US,90.0,15.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Santa Barbara Winery,"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that shows why this warmish Santa Barbara County valley is such a natural home for the variety. With crisp acidity and a creamy texture, it's dry and minerally, with interestingly rich flavors of citrus fruits, melons and pears, and a touch of smoky oak."
Italy,85.0,9.0,Sicilia,Feudo Arancio,"This Pinot Grigio has a slightly greenish hue and fragrant aromas of citrus, white flower and exotic fruit. You can really taste its sunny Sicilian roots: the wine has light density but is fuller and softer than wines from the north."
US,92.0,38.0,Atlas Peak,Corvalle,"A first-rate Syrah, exhibiting all the desirable aspects of the variety. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with blackberry, pie spice, grilled bacon and sandalwood flavors, and enough black pepper to fill a shaker. Drink now??015."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,San Silvestro,"This opens with tobacco, black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. The straightforward palate offers black cherry fruit with hints of white pepper and nutmeg structured with rounded tannins. Enjoy through 2019."
France,89.0,25.0,Alsace,Domaine BarmÃ¨s-Buecher,The nose of juicy plum promises ripe fruit. The palate follows with a generous softness. There is ease on this light body and lots of freshness. Enjoy while aromas are at their peak.
France,90.0,26.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Subtle notes of concentrated rose petals and almost smoky honeysuckle come with a flinty aspect. The palate is defined by pithy lemon and bergamot interspersed with aromatic spices like lemon pepper and cardamom. It is the zesty core, however, that draws you in, with pithy grapefruit notes that last along with the fruity spice."
France,89.0,14.0,CÃ´tes de Bourg,ChÃ¢teau Peychaud,"Dark in color, this is a bold, spicy wine. It has firm tannins that contrast well with the dense black fruits and acidity. The combination makes for a wine that promises to age well?rich and with a fine smoky aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
France,97.0,1100.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau La Mission Haut-Brion,"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential."
US,88.0,35.0,Bennett Valley,Matanzas Creek,"Lots of richness in this smoky young Merlot. You'll find detailed flavors of grilled blackberries, red and black cherry preserves, leather, anise and cedar. It's a finely structured, dry wine whose tannins will work against rosemary-scented broiled lamb chops."
US,90.0,52.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Heart O' The Mountain,"A big Pinot Noir, darkly colored and full-bodied in the mouth. The depth of fruit is impressive, packing a solid core of black cherries and plums. Might gain some bottle notes over the next 4?? years."
Argentina,83.0,15.0,Uco Valley,O. Fournier,"Oily, gritty stone-fruit aromas announce a plump, soft palate with papaya and banana flavors. A mealy quality and bitterness rise up on the finish."
US,93.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Johndrow Vineyards,"Shows deep, concentrated flavors of blackberries and black currants, with classically fine, complex Napa tannins. It's 100% Cabernet, with 50% new oak, and although the label doesn't say so, the grapes come from a Howell Mountain vineyard. Beautiful now, and will develop over the next 6?? years. Decant for hours if you open it now."
Italy,95.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Sesta di Sopra,"Sesta di Sopra delivers a superb and beautiful Brunello with impossible richness and gorgeous intensity. Aromas include black cherry, vanilla, dark mocha, freshly ground espresso and a subtle touch of mineral dryness at the end. It's equally impressive on the palate with smooth, thick intensity."
Australia,91.0,120.0,McLaren Vale,Kay Brothers,"This doesn't appear to be the strongest recent vintage of this wine, but it remains a benchmark for McLaren Vale Shiraz. Hints of vanilla and tobacco leaf add nuance to a mix of berries ranging from red raspberry to black currant, but there's also a hint of bruised fruit and a green toughness to the tannins. Give it some time in the cellar. Drink 2020??030."
Italy,89.0,40.0,Alto Adige,Tiefenbrunner,"This 100% Lagrein opens with aromas of black-skinned berries, baking spices and licorice. The medium-bodied concentrated palate delivers black plums, mocha and clove alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2019."
Italy,85.0,27.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Perusini,"This is very pretty and enjoyable, with creamy peach, butterscotch and yellow rose notes. The wine has a lean, compact feel and a crisp, citrusy finish."
US,94.0,70.0,Sonoma Coast,J Vineyards & Winery,"An enormously elegant, complex Pinot Noir that changes endlessly in the glass and is a joy to drink. Completely dry, and marked by silky tannins, it shows complicated cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, orange tea and sandalwood flavors. First class. Best now and for the next four or five years."
Spain,88.0,40.0,Ribera del Duero,Bodegas y ViÃ±edos Rauda,"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good. A powerpacked wine with a fierce mouthfeel; only time can bring it around. Hold until 2011."
Argentina,86.0,17.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Jammy aromas of raspberry and cherry show a slightly pickled, brambly edge, while the palate delivers tight, grabby cherry and berry flavors. There's a bit of cheesy tang to the finish, while sheering acidity and an overall light body make it food friendly."
US,89.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Adelaida,"The blend of 40% Grenache Blanc, 28% Viognier, 20% Picpoul Blanc, and 12% Roussanne hits the nose with minerality and citrus, wound tightly around tangerine peel. The flavors are almost all lime zest and chalk, making for a brisk pre-dinner drink or perfect shellfish partner."
Argentina,85.0,11.0,Mendoza,Zolo,"Plum and cola aromas set up a spunky, rubbery Merlot that features a mix of roasted berry and chocolaty oak flavors. It is mild on the finish."
US,88.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Neyers,"This likable blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is rounded and medium bodied. Red currant, cherry and vanilla cola flavors comprise the juicy palate, wrapped lightly in oak."
US,86.0,13.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"While redolent of jasmine blossoms and sweet orange marmalade, Hosmer's dry Riesling is surprisingly austere on the palate with hints of fresh fennel fronds and a gripping lemon acidity. A good match for heavier, savory fare like braised pork belly, it finishes on a pleasantly bitter citrus-pith note."
Spain,88.0,22.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Veiga da Princesa,"This fresh, young AlbariÃ±o is offering mild citrus and pear aromas. The palate is crisp, light in weight and good as a whole, with citrus, green apple and nectarine flavors. On the finish, peach and papaya flavors show a tinge of bitterness."
US,88.0,18.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"Held back for four years before release, this Zin has achieved a creamy softness. The flavors offer a blast of peppery, briary wild red, black and blue berries and currants, with vibrant hints of bacon, cola and sandalwood. Great value in a Zinfandel this likeable."
Spain,84.0,6.0,Rioja,J. Garcia Carrion,"This is snappy all the way, if a touch raw and citric on the palate. Freshness is a virtue on this affordable Rioja, while red plum, raspberry and milk chocolate notes carry the flavor profile. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,32.0,Alto Adige,Manincor,This is one of those deliciously dry and mineral-driven Sauvignons that doles out just enough fruit and herbal intensity to keep it interesting and exciting. Stone fruit and cantaloupe melon round off the close.
France,86.0,20.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Gardut Haut Cluzeau,"This wine is perfumed, ripe and soft. It shows the richness of the vintage with plenty of warm fruit. Lemon flavors lend a final lift to richer apricot and pear notes. Drink now."
US,91.0,44.0,Yakima Valley,Efeste,"Merlot makes up half of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) and Cabernet Franc. It announces itself with nuanced aromas of herb, dried leaves and flowers, along with black currant. The flavors are palate coating and textured, showing depth but also restraint."
US,87.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Fulkerson,"Savory, rustic notes of dried mushroom and toasted nuts mingle with richly concentrated black-cherry and rose-petal flavors on this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Noir. Soft tannins and just a shade of toasted oak add richness and dimension to the palate."
US,90.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"From a Pinot Noir specialist in the heart of the Russian River Valley, this white is equal parts floral and fruity, shy and dry, with a succulent layering of lime, grapefruit and fig. A medium level of acidity wraps itself around a viscous core, keeping the wine fresh on the palate. It's the right kind of weighty, finishing with ginger and honey."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Prosecco Treviso,ValdellÃ¶vo,"Simple and straightforward, this has honest aromas of yellow fruit and perfumed white flower. It's an easy-drinking sparkler that should pair well with salads or raw fish."
US,90.0,48.0,Templeton Gap District,ONX,"This blending house adds 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Malbec to boost this Zinfandel-based wine, which shows baked strawberries, blackberry puree, beef char and smoke on the nose. The fruit is tart and black on the palate, with mint and anise notes."
US,94.0,32.0,Dundee Hills,Trisaetum,"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing."
US,87.0,32.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Boekenoogen,"There's a noticeably sweet quality to this bottling that will appeal to some but turn off others. Spun sugar, buttercream, honeysuckle and orange mousse show on the nose, while the palate offers flavors of apple butter, brown sugar and lemon custard."
France,91.0,25.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau d'Agassac,"The second wine of Agassac is smooth, full of the fruit of this fresh year. With bright red-berry fruits and soft tannins it is a wine that is developing quickly. It will be delicious and ready to drink from 2018."
US,86.0,26.0,Santa Barbara County,Consilience,"There's a slightly reductive quality on the nose of this wine, with rubber, tar, dill and hot lava rock notes. The palate shows roast beef char, sour cherry fruits and asphalt."
US,91.0,20.0,Lodi,Mensch,"Rich, ripe pear and peach flavors light up this full-bodied and creamy-textured wine. The fruit flavors are gorgeous and expressive, and they come with an appetizing layer of subtle acidity to balance out the full mouthfeel."
France,85.0,18.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Acker-Perreau,"This is a fruity, ready-to-drink wine, with acidity cutting through the juicy black currant fruits. This is attractive and bright, yet structured."
US,86.0,32.0,Sonoma Valley,Muscardini,"This is soft and jammy, with raspberry, cherry and oak flavors. A pretty wine, with a good tannin-acid balance, for drinking now."
Italy,89.0,14.0,Chianti Classico,I Fabbri,"This shows earthy aromas of forest floor, plum and leather, with intense notes of bell pepper and whiffs of red currant, all of which carry through to the savory palate. The fresh acidity makes it a perfect match for mildly seasoned cheeses or grilled burgers. Siena Imports, Barsotti Wines."
US,88.0,20.0,Napa County,Cosentino,"A white Meritage of just over 53% Sauvignon Blanc with the remainder SÃ©millon, aged in neutral French oak, this wine has a full body and a balance of crispness and weight. Lemon, lime, pear and honeydew melon highlight the aromas and flavors, finishing with length."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Toscana,Carpineto,"Aromas of oak, toast and a whiff of mature yellow apple skin lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the subdued palate along with a note of candied nectarine zest. A note of bitter walnut marks the close."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Barbera d'Asti,Caldera,"This structured Barbera offers aromas of ripe cherry, raspberry and plum with light toasted notes. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry with black pepper and licorice, layered with a hint of espresso. This still needs a year or two to fully unwind, so it's best after 2015."
France,84.0,13.0,MediterranÃ©e,ChÃ¢teau Coussin,"This light blend of wines from across Provence is crisp but somewhat lacking in flavor. It has a light, bright aftertaste. Drink now."
France,85.0,25.0,Bandol,Domaines Bunan,"This Kosher wine is darker in color than many Provence rosÃ©s. Made from organically grown grapes it has an earthy character that masks some of the fruit. The acidity and the sense of freshness are, however, all there."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Tupungato,Finca Sophenia,"Dark yet a touch murky on the bouquet, with weight and black-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but healthy, with peppery flavors accenting core blackberry and chocolate. Chunky and proper, if a tad bit bitter on the finish. Gets better as it airs out."
US,97.0,125.0,Anderson Valley,Williams Selyem,"This is a seductive and deeply satisfying Pinot Noir, light in rose petal and red cherry notes and yet intense and voluptuous in texture. Part of the winery's 30th anniversary celebration, with the fruit coming from original co-founder Burt Williams' Morning Dew Ranch in Anderson Valley, this is a remarkably polished and balanced wine, with a racy jolt of spiciness on the finish."
France,84.0,24.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau des Bertrands,This is a stalky wine with blackberry fruit and a dry tannic edge. It may soften although the acidity suggests it will always be a lean wine.
US,89.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Joseph Phelps,"The grape is Scheurebe, grown in Germany and Austria, a variety that lends itself to dessert wines. The wine is lush, with honey, apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It's a little soft for such sweetness, but superdelicious."
France,90.0,75.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Michel et Joana Ecard,"Rather lean and austere, this is a tight, structured wine. Its future lies in the firm tannins and the juicy red-currant fruit. Wait for this wine and don't drink before 2020."
France,88.0,16.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Laudun Chusclan,"This four-variety blend shows that crisp, refreshing white wines can emerge from the Southern RhÃ´ne. Hints of pineapple, pear and mandarin orange mark this medium-bodied white. Drink now??016."
US,91.0,100.0,Howell Mountain,Lamborn Family Vineyards,"Made by Heidi Peterson Barrett from the Lamborn family's own grapes, this wine reflects its mountain home, densely concentrated in rich, blackberry jam and dried herb. Full bodied, it packs a punch before showing finesse and shocks of dried herb on the finish."
Spain,82.0,11.0,Cava,Bellisco,"Funky, yeasty aromas of cinnamon, spent lees and bread yeast dominate the nose. This feels foamy, with lightly vegetal flavors of apple that finish briny."
US,85.0,17.0,Carneros,Fleur de California,"A bit raw and acidic, lacking generosity, but you'll find some decent cherry flavors in this dry Pinot Noir."
US,90.0,80.0,Carneros,Domaine Carneros,"This wine is made from estate-grown grapes and a selection of clones, offering robust dark cherry and berry fruit spiked with cardamom, cola and black tea. Smooth and silky on the palate, it finishes with a trace of tart pomegranate and smoke."
US,89.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,Tagaris,"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mÃ©lange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating."
US,88.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Keuka Spring,"Intensely fruity, almost tropical, on the nose and palate, this concentrated, juicy GewÃ¼rztraminer balances rich melon and lychee flavors with delicate notes of tea and spice. Just a hint off-dry in style."
US,88.0,18.0,Sonoma Coast,Taken Wine Co.,"Stylistically focused in its clear embrace of fruit and cool-climate acidity, this balanced white is honeysuckle-inflected, with steely pear and orange blossom elements, unfettered by oak."
France,89.0,13.0,Alsace,Domaine Robert Klingenfus,"The citrus notes on the nose are subdued. On the palate, they strike up and portray tangerine and lemon on the slender, dry and fresh body. The finish almost has a tropical quality."
US,84.0,20.0,Madera,Westbrook Wine Farm,"A bit Porty, with raisiny flavors, but the finish is dry, and the tannins are nice and rich. Something about it brings to mind Cognac."
Spain,87.0,17.0,Alicante,Volver,"This Monastrell is dark, youthful, concentrated and robust on the nose. In the mouth, it's rich, thick and borderline sticky, with creamy flavors of blackberry and chocolate. That same oak-based creaminess carries onto the finish, which is resiny in feel and chocolaty in flavor."
US,88.0,62.0,Alexander Valley,The Calling,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend includes smaller percentages of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Together they are a velvety thick and rich exploration of berry-patch flavors and smoky oak founded on a floor of soft tannin."
US,88.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"Blended with 5% SÃ©millon, this crisp, tropical white is generous with bright acidity and a strong taste of pineapple and lemon. Zippy minerality adds a stoniness to the texture and flavor, as a fresh-cut grass note lingers in the background."
France,89.0,18.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine de Boischampt,"A ripe and fruity wine with rounded tannins and fragrant acidity. The wine is juicy with red berries while soft at the end. It's delicious now, and will be even better from 2015."
US,89.0,35.0,Livermore Valley,Occasio,"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex. The tannins are most pronounced on the finish and need time to further integrate, but make the wine long-lasting in leathery cassis and tobacco flavor."
US,93.0,85.0,Sonoma Coast,Hirsch,"Maybe the friendliest Hirsch bottling, this wine has wonderful complexity, medium body and a broad supple texture that make it a pleasure to taste. It has spicy lightly earthy aromas, plenty of raspberry, red cherry and rhubarb for fruit flavors, and a good sense of layering on the palate, followed by a long finish."
US,91.0,30.0,Green Valley,Ron Rubin,"The first vintage of this variety for this producer, this lovely white comes from a rare and renowned site in Green Valley. An austere nose of lemony green apple and honey follows through on the crisp, light-bodied palate. Floral in apple blossom, it reveals a touch of wet stone on the finish."
France,91.0,35.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Roche de Bellene,Vines planted in 1947 are the source of this dark and concentrated wine. It has a strongly smoky character with dry tannins. They contrast with the potential of the red cherry and berry fruits that are ripe and juicy. The wine is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2019.
Argentina,94.0,100.0,Mendoza,Monteviejo,"Dark and incredibly concentrated, with earth, black fruits, mint and exotic side notes. It's stout and tannic, but also rich and pure, with monster black fruit flavor and powerful coffee, toast and length on the finish. A smashing wine that's huge but delicious. Drink now through 2017."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Maremma Toscana,Querciabella,"Spiced plum, dried herbs, underbrush and toasted oak aromas waft out of the glass. A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, the palate offers up ripe black currant, crushed mint, espresso and tobacco accompanied by fine-grained tannins."
Italy,90.0,55.0,Barolo,Mauro Veglio,"Dark concentration and medium aromatic intensity open Barolo Castelletto. There's a delicate, feminine side to this Nebbiolo that presents itself through aromas of pressed violet, root beer, chopped mint and peppermint. Those fresh overtones are backed by tight, gripping tannins. Drink after 2018."
US,85.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Fuse,"This interesting Cabernet shows blackberry and cassis flavors alongside earthy notes of green olive and mint. The acidity is sharp and keen. It's not going anywhere, so drink up."
France,88.0,20.0,Reuilly,Domaine de Reuilly,"Pinot Gris, with its pale-pink skin, is the grape of choice in Reuilly for rosÃ©s. With a color that matches pale rosÃ©s from Provence, the wine is lightly spicy while also dry. Its balanced acidity is just right. Drink now."
France,91.0,33.0,Alsace,Domaine Gresser,"Subdued earth notes precede the ripe freshness of red apple and mirabelle. A touch of residual sweetness boosts ripe fruit flavors of pear and orange, red apple and mirabelle plum. Lemon freshness brightens the palate and makes for an appetizing, zingy and refreshing finish."
Italy,86.0,21.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Serre Spumanti,"Food friendly, this has soft tones of peach and melon. There's a touch of fresh acidity that helps to smooth out the naturally rich perlage."
France,91.0,85.0,Champagne,Aubry,"This wine is bone-dry, although with some age the shock of the acidity has been rounded out by a hint of toast. It's linear, fresh and intensely crisp, with citrus and almond tones. Drink this wine from a good vintage now."
US,89.0,50.0,Los Carneros,Poseidon,"Attractively dry but at the same time rich and buttery, this wine achieves a good balance of fresh acidity and full flavor. The aromas are like caramel and butter, flavors suggest spiced apples and the finish carries them through."
France,84.0,200.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"In the twisted logic of Champagne, Extra-Dry is sweeter than Brut. This old vintage, released after 10 years, has been given an extra dosage. The result is a curious wine, honeyed, sweet, with a candied lemon-lime character."
US,86.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Tierra y Mar,"This is a soft, simple white marked by green olive and vanilla bean flavors that feel concentrated and full on the finish."
France,85.0,14.0,Vin Mousseux,Bouvet-Ladubay,It makes sense to produce this red sparkling wine in a medium-dry form. That's because the inevitable tannins are modified and are there to give shape to the strawberry fruits and fresh acidity. It's perhaps an acquired taste but would be fine with fruit desserts.
US,86.0,18.0,North Fork of Long Island,Comtesse ThÃ©rÃ¨se,"The nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves, warm spice and toasted, nutty oak. There's a nice, lush texture and body, and bright red cherry and plums flavors on the palate. The fruit flavors may be slightly lacking in concentration, but supple tannins make for smooth, easy sipping."
Argentina,88.0,17.0,Salta,Kaiken,"Tropical-fruit aromas of lychee and passion fruit come with a hint of lanolin. This wine feels citrusy, with fresh passion fruit and tangerine flavors that are not oily or gritty on the finish."
Argentina,90.0,25.0,Mendoza,DoÃ±a Silvina,"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Barbaresco,Pasquale Pelissero,"Aromas here are not very intense but include cherry liqueur, forest floor, white licorice and crushed pepper. Bright acidity and sour berry flavors appear on the close followed by firm but polished tannins."
US,88.0,20.0,Eola-Amity Hills,St. Innocent,"A pale-colored rosÃ© made entirely from Pinot Noir, this skates near off-dry territory, with perceptible sweetness. It's fruity, soft and round, with forward flavors of cherries and cream."
France,84.0,13.0,Saumur-Champigny,Besombes Moc Baril,"This is a light, earthy wine from the limestone soil of Saumur-Champigny. It is soft, lightly smoky and with some attractive tannins and berry fruits in the background. The wine is ready to drink."
US,92.0,38.0,Yakima Valley,Ã Maurice,"This cool-vintage wine saw just 10% new oak, putting the fruit front and center with aromas of smoke, freshly ground black pepper and whiffs of bacon fat. It's supple and lithe in feel, showing purity and detail in a style that is all about elegance."
France,93.0,128.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This vineyard is at the heart of the fine run of premier crus that lie midway up the slope above the village. This wine is packed with fruit and also with intense acidity and minerality. It is already refreshing and crisp, although as the toastiness develops, it will become even more impressive. Drink from 2017."
US,85.0,39.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Coquelicot,"This wine is mostly Syrah, which gives juicy blackberry, plum and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. The slight percent of Viognier brings acidity and an uplifted floral note to this easy-drinking wine."
US,94.0,70.0,Washington,Charles Smith,"The aromas are pretty and pure, with perfumed notes of plum and blackberry speckled with spice and herb. The flavors are seamless and full, showing a real sense of freshness and vibrancy capped off by a tart finish that hangs together impressively."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Barolo,Mario Gagliasso,"This Barolo offers tobacco leaf, porcini mushroom, roasted coffee bean and espresso aromas. The palate delivers ripe plum and coffee notes, and ripe, round tannins. This isn't a very typical expression of Barolo, but it's enjoyable. It's already approachable. Drink it now and over the next few years."
US,88.0,32.0,Santa Barbara County,Samsara,"This Syrah is remarkably ripe in blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit, with a bite of acidity. It feels fine and vital in the mouth. Give it a brief decant."
Italy,87.0,21.0,San Martino della Battaglia,Citari,"Made entirely with Friulano (formerly called Tocai Italico), this vibrant white conveys aromas of white flower, citrus and nut that carry over to the palate along with a slight metallic note. Bitter walnut marks the close."
US,91.0,35.0,Sierra Foothills,Tanner,"Richness and density highlight this full-bodied and deftly oaked wine that smells like baking spices and black pepper sprinkled on ripe black cherry and dark chocolate. The texture is very inviting, almost thick, and beautifully marries the ripe fruit with velvety tannins."
US,88.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Foppiano,"One of the producer's signature varieties, this impresses in its nutty gamy overview that recalls the sensations and smells of an Italian deli. Rich red fruit makes for a juicy core built around substantial tannins that become supple on the palate. The finish is about black pepper."
US,86.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gamache,"Aromas of herb, macerated cherries, toast, flowers and a strong Band Aid note are followed by sleek cherry and game flavors that narrowtoward the finish."
US,86.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Rosenblum,"The high alcohol shows through everything else, giving this Zin a chili pepper heat and a distracting Port-like sensation. It's rich and dry, with firm tannins framing the blackberry and currant flavors."
US,92.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Elyse,"Classic Petite Sirah, in the full-bodied richness, dryness, hard tannins and deep flavors of ripe dark berries and fruits, cocoa, grilled meat and black pepper. As good as that is, it also shows the impeccable balance of a fine Napa Valley red wine. Good now with robust meat stews and roasts, and it should develop for many years."
US,89.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Amalie Robert,"As before, the Estate Selection is the bigger of the two Pinots from Amalie, textural and clean. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors hint at herb and stem, but all the details are in proportion and complement each other. Not for long aging, but drinking well right now."
US,84.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Laura's Vineyard,"Soft and oaky, this Cab has a slightly rustic mouthfeel. It's very ripe in cherries, blackberries and smoky vanilla. Drink now."
Spain,93.0,60.0,Ribera del Duero,Alidis,"This is earthy, cool and foresty on the bouquet, with a coconut note that accents the wine's deep berry aromas. It feels smooth and nicely balanced, with modest tannins and toasty, oaky flavors of spiced blackberry and licorice. Smooth and subtle on the finish, this is ripe, stylish and ready to drink now."
Spain,83.0,8.0,Campo de Borja,Bodegas Aragonesas,"Light plum and raspberry aromas include notes of animal and latex. This lightweight Garnacha has a monotone mouthfeel, while hollow simple berry flavors finish with acidic tang."
Australia,89.0,15.0,Victoria,Redbank,"An admirable effort, combining lemony citrus notes with hints of pear and quince. It's medium in body, with a long, crisp finish."
Canada,90.0,30.0,Okanagan Valley,Tinhorn Creek,"A reserve-level Merlot, this is blended with 9% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, then barrel-aged for 18 months in new, one- and two-year-old French oak barrels. Oaky, smoky, charred and tannic, it's a bit of a bruiser. But dig down and you'll find cassis, black cherry, coffee, cola, licorice and tar?in short, a compelling range of dark flavors, all well-integrated. Drink soon."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Pietrafitta,"La Costa Riserva, made with the zesty Vernaccia grape (one of Tuscany's most important white wine varieties), is a big, bold wine with thick layers of banana, apricot and vanilla cream. The rich wine doesn't feel heavy on the palate thanks to a crisp spot of acidity on the close."
US,91.0,42.0,Sonoma Valley,Turley,"While this Zin is high in alcohol, which gives it some peppery heat, it's dry and complex. The flavors range from ripe blackberry, blueberry and currant to dark chocolate, licorice and warm-climate Zin spice. The vineyard contains 80-year-old vines, grown in the mountains above the valley floor, which explains the wine's unique concentration."
France,89.0,18.0,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,"Honeysuckle notes hover over ripe pears. The palate boosts these notions even more with some residual sweetness that enhances the fruitiness. Edged with pleasant pithiness, the finish is off dry but balanced."
US,86.0,16.0,Clarksburg,Clarksburg Wine Company,"Clarksburg is becoming a haven for Chenin Blanc in California. This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold."
US,92.0,29.0,Umpqua Valley,Abacela,"This terrific wine is classically varietal, with beautifully defined flavors of cured meats, tobacco, coffee, lavender and peppercorn, all in service to ripe purple fruits. Impeccably balanced, it conveys finesse."
US,88.0,18.0,Potter Valley,Monte Volpe,"This white blend of Vermentino, Moscato Giallo, Fiano and Pinot Grigio is elegant and austere with notes of lemon and grass. Herbal and fresh, it shines with Vermentino's distinct personality. This is a unique white blend from Mendocino with Italian roots that's definitely worth trying."
Spain,87.0,13.0,Rueda,Montespina,"Pungent, borderline sweaty aromas of passion fruit, mango and orange peel are classic SB. This Rueda-based Sauvignon is zesty on the palate, with strict flavors of grapefruit, passion fruit and tangerine. A crisp, fresh, slightly pithy finish doesn't hurt."
US,92.0,60.0,Anderson Valley,Davies,"This seductive wine has a deep ruby color, jazzy cherry and plum aromas and an elegantly balanced mouthfeel. It offers plenty of fruit flavors that are fresh and just a touch tart like they should be, firm tannins and full body. Best after 2018."
US,84.0,9.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Kirkland Signature,"Merlot makes up just over three-quarters of this wine. Unusual aromas of brown stems, flowers and blue fruit lead to lightly sweet fruit flavors supported by dry puckering tannins. Overall, the concentration seems lacking."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Taurasi,Donnachiara,"Spiced plum, blue flower, vanilla, French oak and balsamic aromas lead the way on this firmly structured red. Full-bodied and elegant, the youthful, enveloping palate evokes blackberry, black cherry, pipe tobacco and ground clove framed in tightly knit fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020??032."
France,87.0,12.0,Vin de France,Vinadeis,"Consistently the top showing wine from the Le Val range, this is ripe and rounded, with a creamy texture and a toasty, spicy touch from light wood aging. Drink now."
US,89.0,75.0,Stags Leap District,Cliff Lede,"Generous tannins surround a core of ripe, brawny blackberry fruit and a powerful imprint of dried herb in this wine, which is rich and concentrated. Earthy tobacco and chocolate seal the finish."
Australia,90.0,21.0,McLaren Vale,Angove,"The blend is 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% MourvÃ¨dre, but while this is a full-bodied wine, it's not overdone or bombastic. The masses of dark fruit are reined in by crisp acids and a layer of supple tannins, adding depth to the cassis, vanilla and mint flavors. Drink now through 2020."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Mendoza,Aconcagua,"Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish."
US,93.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Titus,"Titus's regular '06 Cab is a wonderful wine. Their Reserve is even better, showing a more dramatic structure of smooth, complex tannins and a more intense, fruity profile. Offers lavish waves of blackberries, black currants, cassis, smoky oak and minerals, with notes of chocolate and cappuccino. Delicious now and through 2013."
US,85.0,19.0,Paso Robles,The Auctor,"This blend of 57% Syrah, 35% Grenache, 6% MourvÃ¨dre and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon shows black plums, roasted figs, cinnamon stick, uncrushed clove and star anise on the nose. That great nose doesn't translate yet to the palate, which is sticky with dark plum skin tannins, and proves a bit too leathery for drinking right now. Wait awhile and this one might work better."
US,91.0,45.0,Umpqua Valley,Paul O'Brien,"This is sourced from 30-year-old WÃ¤denswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious."
Italy,94.0,155.0,Barolo,Luciano Sandrone,"The Le Vigne cru from Luciano Sandrone delivers focused aromas of wild cherries, white almond, cola and light shadings of sweet spice. The texture is drying and firm and the wine excels in the mouth thanks to the tight and supple feel of its tannins. Pair this delicious wine with lamb, pork or beef."
Canada,91.0,23.0,Okanagan Valley,Township 7,"Rich and creamy, this barrel-fermented (in neutral oak) wine has appealing flavors of pear tart, grapefruit and coconut cream pie. The bracing acids compensate for all the lush creamy flavor, and the result is darn near irresistible."
US,88.0,10.0,Washington,14 Hands,"No specific blend is listed on this delicious wine?in the past it's been Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and SÃ©millon. Luscious, ripe fruit flavors of grapefruit, melon and loads of fresh pear combine to show a wonderfully fresh and tasty white wine. The acids lift up the brightness, and this round and fruity style is a can't miss proposition."
US,86.0,35.0,Paso Robles,LXV,"Named after the fourth art of Kama Sutra, this wine shows Juicy Fruit gum aromas as well as banana candies and a squeeze of lemon. There is a lime-pith tension to the powerful bubblegum ripeness alongside papaya, banana and yellow melon."
Canada,91.0,60.0,Niagara Peninsula,Cave Spring,"Golden raisins, poached pear, caramel and butterscotch meld together in this low alcohol, intensely flavored icewine. The flavors expand to include candied pineapple, with tremendous viscosity and enough acidity to keep it aloft and penetrating."
US,91.0,54.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pursued by Bear,"Aromas of vanilla bean, coconut and cocoa meld with cherry cola and dark fruit. The palate has tart, focused cranberry and cherry flavors with a restrained, velvety feel."
US,95.0,75.0,Russian River Valley,Arista,"This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents."
US,91.0,30.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Firestone,"This study of a low-yielding clone produced a compelling range of aromas and flavors. The nose leads with iodine, seaweed and coffee scents against a backdrop of tangy black fruit. The palate shows more nori, lavender, black pepper, asphalt and dried blackberry flavor, finishing on a lingering oaky note."
US,89.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas pop, with notes of fresh blueberry pie, sweet herb, dark-roasted coffee and spice. The palate doesn't quite deliver on all those aromas, seeming a bit less bold than the nose suggests. Still, this wine is enjoyable, especially after it has time to open up."
US,85.0,16.0,Russian River Valley,River Road,"Sweet aromas of almond paste and stone fruit, as well as green apple, mark this wine fermented in stainless steel tanks. It has a slight effervescence and a hint of lime and Asian pear on the finish."
US,92.0,67.0,Alexander Valley,Trione,"Rich and dramatic, packed with red and black currant, and sandalwood flavors. This is a very intense wine, impressive for its power. Seems a natural for aging. Hold until 2019 at least."
Argentina,88.0,18.0,Salta,Finca las Nubes,"With a hint of yellow color, this fuller-bodied TorrontÃ©s presents classic aromas of bath oils, white flowers and tropical fruits. The palate is plump and melony, with modest acidity that says ?drink me now.??Flavors of melon and lychee finish soft and creamy."
France,85.0,14.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Jaffelin,"There is some of the structure characteristic of 2010 Beaujolais in this wine, but it is mainly dominated by a red cherry flavor and fresh acidity. It's ripe, fruity and ready to drink."
France,91.0,23.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Larose-Trintaudon,"One of the largest vineyards in the MÃ©doc and just outside Pauillac, this estate is also one of the most reliable. This vintage is finely structured with just the right amount of tannin to support the black and red-berry fruits. Fruity and juicy, it should be ready to drink from 2020."
US,88.0,40.0,Wahluke Slope,Maryhill,"This wine is brightly aromatic, with raspberry, mint, herb and woodspice notes. The palate is full of plush, plump fruit flavors that provide appeal, despite the prominent alcohol."
France,85.0,15.0,Beaujolais,Vignerons des Pierres DorÃ©es,"Finely structured, this is a fruity wine with bright cherry fruit and acidity. It has a drier edge that gives it texture and shape. The fresher aftertaste gives the wine a fruity lift. Drink now."
US,91.0,30.0,Oregon,Sineann,"This dark, full-bodied and well-balanced effort is jam-packed with flavor. A big burst of blackberry, blue plum and black cherry holds down the center palate. It's focused, fresh, ripe and lingers broadly. It's a wine to buy by the case and drink over the next decade."
France,89.0,27.0,Alsace,Domaine de la Tour Blanche,"Subdued floral notes signal a restrained Gewurztraminer. The palate has ample freshness and gentle perfume, making for a subtle wine that plays down the fragrances but boosts the spiciness. It finishes fresh and wonderfully peppery."
US,90.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Bynum,"From a site on Westside Road, this vineyard-designate boasts a rich experience aromatically and flavor-wise, revealing graham cracker, peach, lime and green apple alongside salty acidity. The oak (34% of it new French) plays a pleasant, supportive role, adding a note of brioche."
US,93.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),JM Cellars,"All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Barolo,Negretti,"This straight Barolo has an exotic fragrance of spice, sandalwood and incense, while the palate shows ripe raspberry, spice and balsamic herbs. It's tannic and shy on acidity, typical of the hot 2007 vintage. Drink now."
France,83.0,12.0,PÃ©rigord,Couleur d'Aquitaine,"From the hills of the Dordogne region, this is a fruity wine. It has a rustic, barnyard edge to it that spoils what is otherwise a fresh, crisp wine. Drink now."
US,95.0,100.0,Amador County,Renwood,"Almost as big as a Port, but not sweet, this densely concentrated but surprisingly gentle wine offers opulent, ripe and almost jammy berry flavors that coat the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth long after each sip. It's technically dry, but so rich with blackberry and cassis flavors that it seems sweet from the first aroma to the lingering finish. It will be best after 2024."
US,84.0,11.0,Mendocino,Husch,"The thing to know about this wine is it's a little sweet and also a little soft. The flavors are lovely, suggesting apricots, peaches, Meyer lemons and honeysuckle flowers."
US,83.0,13.0,Monterey,Bianchi,"For those who like their white wines distinctly sweet, this tastes like apricot and orange jam, with the stimulating heat of alcohol."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Astoria,"Honeysuckle and white stone-fruit aromas waft out of the glass. On the bright, creamy palate, a lemon drop note underscores yellow apple and pear alongside vibrant acidity."
US,90.0,36.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mounts,"Brick red in color, this wine also smells of brick and smoke. On the palate, it's moderately structured and robustly ripe, showing burly blueberry and mocha chocolate flavors with unfettered fervor."
US,92.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now."
US,87.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Force of Nature,"Cooked berries, turned earth, sweet tar and dark chocolate aromas greet the nose on this blend of 67% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Syrah and 11% Petite Sirah from Mossfire Ranch. Ripe, plump and dark strawberries power the rich, grippy palate, along with licorice lift and vanilla elements on the finish."
Italy,90.0,28.0,Franciacorta,Lantieri de Paratico,"This offers intense aromas of acacia flower, peach blossom and apricot. The palate delivers citrus, walnut, bread crust and stone fruit flavors balanced by vibrant acidity and closes with a clean, dry finish. Perfect on its own or paired with delicately seasoned fish dishes."
Australia,86.0,13.0,South Australia,Jacob's Creek,White pepper and dill scents make up a promising beginning and lead to a velvety palate with plenty of roasted meat and black cherry fruit. A fine choice with barbecue. Drink now to 2010.
US,86.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Judd's Hill,"Light in color and body, this is a silky Pinot Noir for everyday fare. It shows cola, cherry jam, persimmon and Asian spice flavors, with a coating of toasty oak."
France,89.0,38.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau LÃ©on,"This pure Merlot special cuvÃ©e is intense, rich and extracted. It has serious layers of spice and toast from wood aging. That lies over a solid structure that is concentrated and dense. The fruit is more masked and the bitter licorice character of the wine means it will take several years to come together. Drink from 2020."
France,88.0,12.0,Pays d'Oc,Domaine de l'Engarran,"Aroams of high-toned cherry and berry lead the nose of this wine, with secondary scents of tar, balsamic and leathery spice. Medium weight and smooth in body, the satiny tannins provide a subtle, accessible structure, framed by juicy  black-cherry and -raspberry flavors. Drink now."
US,87.0,18.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Babcock,"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills."
US,83.0,38.0,Santa Barbara County,Core Winery,"Hot, raspingly dry and pretty tannic to boot, this Grenache, from a high mountain vineyard, also is a little funky and barnyardy. There are some concentrated cherry, currant, Tabasco and pepper-spice flavors, but those strong tannins really get in the way."
US,89.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Revelry,"This wine is 100% varietal and comes from a single block and clone (clone 3). Aromas of woodspice, blue fruit and herbs lead to sweet, supple fruit flavors and grainy tannins. There are a lot of good things going on but the wood steps a bit in front of them."
Italy,93.0,40.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Molino di Sant'Antimo,"This opens with inviting, classic Sangiovese aromas: woodland berry, forest floor, new leather, violet and truffle. The youthfully taut palate isn't quite as expressive?yet?but already offers Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise notes. It's primary in its flavors now but will develop complexity over the next decade and then maintain well for years. Drink 2022??032."
US,85.0,28.0,North Fork of Long Island,Jamesport,"Hints of white blossom and lemon are pleasant in this zesty, full-bodied wine, but are accompanied by savory tones of dusty mineral and white button mushroom. The finish is brisk but clean."
US,87.0,15.0,Napa Valley,Big Ass,"The name is apropos, for this is a big, fleshy wine, almost like one of those Aussie Shirazes in jammy fruit, although it's Cabernet all the way with blackberries and currants. With fine tannins and a smooth finish, it shows quite a bit of sophistication."
US,87.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Bourassa Vineyards,"It's all there in this Chardonnay, with barrel influences of butterscotch and toast, crisp Russian River acidity, and ripe flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples. Feels a bit sharp, so don't over-chill, and you can even give it a decant."
Australia,89.0,17.0,Langhorne Creek,Heartland,"The plush texture and silky midpalate almost define Langhorne Creek, and the cedar, cassis and tobacco notes are classic Cabernet. So what's the rub? The finish falls off just a bit too quickly. It's still nice stuff for the price."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Querce Bettina,"Opening aromas include dark cherry, fragrant blue flower, orange zest and a hint of meat juices. The palate is warm with an overripe quality but not enough fruit richness or freshness."
Spain,86.0,18.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Robalino,"Dusty aromas include notes of apple cider, cured meat and cumin. A loosely built palate features slightly mealy, lightly bitter flavors of pithy citrus and mango, while the finish is plump but not terribly complex or precise."
US,87.0,20.0,North Coast,Indulge,"Packaged in an unusual plastic-style recyclable bag, with a seal you have to figure out how to open, this is a fine Sauvignon Blanc. At the equivalent of 10 bucks for a regular bottle, it's dry, crisp and fruity, with lime and gooseberry flavors. Delivers lots of bang for the buck."
US,88.0,60.0,Carneros,Bouchaine,"Oaky and tannic at first sip, this wine has a softness waiting to let loose on the palate and reveal more floral cherry and raspberry notes. Through and through, the standout characteristic is dried herb, plenty of it, especially on the finish."
Australia,87.0,15.0,McLaren Vale,Normans,"Vanilla and pepper aromas lead to sexy, vanilla and black cherry flavors on the palate and finish. A very good effort and an enjoyable wine, though a little heavy on the vanilla."
US,93.0,34.0,Carneros,Anaba,"This is the winery's first bottling of estate Chardonnay, from a vineyard on the western edges of Carneros named for the owner's two children. Ephemeral and crisp, it speaks to its cooler conditions, exhibiting low oak impact around lilting, floral notes of citrus. Salty, with a restrained hint of vanilla and coconut, it finishes lengthy and complex."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,DENO,"Tons of candied grape and lilac aromas show on the nose of this rather aged blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% MourvÃ¨dre, with root beer and blueberry-sorbet notes. The palate offers a similar array of sweet dark fruit, but the tannic structure and acidity clean it up nicely."
US,87.0,21.0,Ancient Lakes,Crayelle Cellars,This wine has pleasing aromas of pear and melon followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors. It's not particularly serious but it goes down easy.
US,91.0,42.0,Dry Creek Valley,Sbragia,"Leather meets plum sauce meets red licorice in this full-bodied, robustly crafted wine that's plush and lush on the palate. Seismic tannins present themselves upfront in a confrontational way before softening on the finish."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Romagna,Enio Ottaviani,"Aromas of black-skinned berry, tilled soil and cooking spice lead the nose. The savory juicy palate offers ripe black cherry, leather and black pepper alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
US,93.0,17.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton Estate,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value."
US,89.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Market Vineyards,"Vanilla, baking spice, cranberry and cherry aromas lead to soft, medium-bodied fruit flavors with an elegant styling. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage with good balance."
US,91.0,22.0,Santa Maria Valley,Cambria,"So elegant and sophisticated, this is a great value in California Chardonnay. Although it's dry, it's rich and delicious in pineapples, pears, mangoes and honey, with an opulent overlay of sweet oak. The brisk acidity is balanced, and gets the mouth watering."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma Coast,Old World,"An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mÃ©lange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now."
Spain,84.0,15.0,Rioja,Lar de Paula,"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp."
US,91.0,25.0,Anderson Valley,V. Sattui,"This Riesling has just the right amount of minerality balanced against apple and peach flavors, and an underlying core of lime. Fermented in stainless steel, it is bright and joyful to drink, boasting a long finish. Pour alongside all the classic pairings from Asian takeout to a proper curry."
US,88.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"Quite grassy and brisk in style, this wine releases generous aromas of cut tennis ball, wet cement and sour limes. That citrusy acidity and sour-grass energy picks up lime pith, green-apple skins and a touch of white pepper on the palate, a very classic profile."
US,93.0,65.0,Chehalem Mountains,Arbor Brook,"This spent 18 months in 100% new oak?rock star treatment for the winery's top cuvÃ©e. Toast, cherry pipe tobacco and spicy cherry cobbler flavors combine in a deep and potent wine that remains firmly tannic. Optimal drinking is 2018??028."
Spain,84.0,17.0,ValdepeÃ±as,Bodegas Navarro LÃ³pez,"Mildy green and drying on the nose, with bramble and leather along with distant red fruit. The palate is soft, light and fluid, with mild raspberry and plum flavors. Shows oak and resin on the finish, where fruit and structure are in short supply."
US,85.0,21.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"Very dry and tannicly tart, with blackberry, currant and pepper flavors touched with oak. This is a good, everyday wine to drink with rich meat dishes and cheeses."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Barbaresco,Francone,"Dried rose, violet, crushed black cherry, cake spices, leather, herbs and balsamic notes come together alongside bracing tannins. It's already tempting but give it time to unwind. Drink after 2016."
US,86.0,26.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Tasting mature and mellow, this deceptively full-bodied wine has sun-baked aromas, prune and dried-cherry flavors, and a smooth texture. It's lightly tart on the finish."
Italy,90.0,48.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"Formigar is a gorgeous and opulent Chardonnay with lavish aromas of mature fruit, apricot, honeysuckle and toasted almond. It's super smooth and creamy in the mouth and those cool-climate, passion fruit flavors really pop on the finish."
France,91.0,18.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Domaine les Grands PresbytÃ¨res,"The flinty soil of the area of Saint-Fiacre gives a strongly mineral character to this wine. Coming from old vines with an average age of 40-years-old, it is just mature, rich and with great complexity. It is a fine wine, ready to drink now."
US,85.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Stickybeak,"Easy drinking Cabernet here, with soft, gentle tannins framing sweet blackberries, mocha and smoky oak. Not an ager, so enjoy now."
Italy,97.0,550.0,Toscana,Masseto,"The phenomenal 2010 vintage shows why this wine is considered Italy's top purebred Merlot. Revealing structure, finesse and mesmerizing depth, it delivers blackberries, currants, cedar, exotic spices and mocha alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced with fantastic length and while it's delicious now, hold for more complexity. Drink 2015??030."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Falerio,Cherri d'Acquaviva,"Notes of jasmine and acacia mingle with fleshy white peach, apple, citrus and ginger. The lithe palate comes with firm but balanced acidity, while a flinty minerality characterizes the finish."
France,85.0,19.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"This is an attractive, ripe style of Pinot Gris. Off dry, it is aromatic, lightly spicy over crisper pear and yellow fruit flavors. It's ready to drink."
US,88.0,18.0,Lodi,Manifesto!,"This approachable, easy-drinking wine will please a range of different palates. Made by Napa-based winemaker Jamey Whetstone, it has soft red-fruit flavor and a big finish."
US,84.0,18.0,Seneca Lake,Hector Wine Company,"A nut skin note and a whisper of smoke add a savory element to the lemon and apple aromas. It's refreshingly light on it's feet, with a brisk, tonic mouthfeel."
US,89.0,32.0,Lodi,McCay Cellars,"This is a monster Zin, and a very good one. It has an inky black color tinged with red, strong dried-fruit flavors like fig, prune and dried cherry. Along with a smoky, roasted quality on the palate, it has sandy tannins with lots of grip. Powerful and almost sweet."
US,84.0,21.0,Napa Valley,Swanson,"Tastes old, even though it's only from 2008, with some oxidized notes. It's a bone-dry wine, but those citrus and flower flavors are tired."
US,87.0,25.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"This vigorous wine shows the strong flavors that Laetitia Pinot Noirs most always display. It's powerfully ripe, with flavors of cherry, rhubarb pie, pomegranate and spicy persimmon. Full bodied, with pronounced acids and tannins, this offers plenty of generosity."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Sicilia,Feudo Principi di Butera,"This Syrah opens with ripe, pulpy fruit and rich aromas of red cherry, blackberry, spice and crushed black pepper. There are touches of smoke and barbecue on the finish."
US,89.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"Three excellent vineyards?Stonetree, Bacchus and Minnick Hills?contribute to this firmly-built Cabernet Franc. Fine tannins, a light touch of barrel toast and a hint of dark chocolate surround tart blackberry and cassis fruit. A lick of caramel comes out in the finish. Not a big wine, but exceptionally well-balanced."
US,90.0,20.0,Central Coast,Claiborne & Churchill,"Another classic GewÃ¼rz from this fine winery, their best ever. As the label indicates, it's dry, but has an apparent sweetness, with honey-infused orange, Asian pear and litchee nut flavors, and those fabulous exotic spices that are so unique to the variety."
US,88.0,89.0,Napa Valley,Honor Winery,"This big-bottled, wax-topped wine blends half Merlot with a quarter each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Thick and concentrated in red fruit, it holds back on body somewhat, making way for a soft, likable character with a touch of grit among the definitive red cherry."
US,89.0,24.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Noceto,"Noceto is a Sierra Foothills' Sangiovese specialist but does a nice job with Barbera as well, this wine being well-integrated, not heavy-handed (13.8%) with a deft balance between acidity and fruit, mostly sweet cherry and blueberry. Very good."
France,92.0,100.0,Beaune,Domaine Pierre Labet,"Packed with red fruits, this wine has great potential, with attractive wild-strawberry fruits that are fresh and perfumed. Behind this fruitiness, the wine is tight and structured. It will be round, rich and ready to drink from 2019."
Italy,89.0,59.0,Barolo,Tenuta Rocca,"This opens with aromas of ripe berry, pipe tobacco, leather and espresso. The palate offers mature black cherry, coffee, vanilla and mocha alongside firm, drying tannins. It finishes on a licorice note."
Spain,89.0,18.0,Cava,Mont MarÃ§al,"This gets going with clean, light cherry and berry aromas that bring a citrus note to the fore. It feels crisp, dry and pure, with citrus, plum and dust flavors. An elegant rosÃ© made from the Trepat grape, it finishes dry and spicy, with ample leftover fruit."
US,88.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Amalie Robert,"Despite the late harvest label, this is not a dessert wine. It's been fermented to near-dryness, and the late-picked fruit has resulted in quite high alcohol. It's an odd duck, but tasty with an appealing lemon-drop candy flavor."
France,83.0,18.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Domaine des Deux Roches,"This is a wine with harshness, sharp walnut and bitter orange flavors. It gives off a hard feeling that probably won't soften much."
US,92.0,25.0,Santa Maria Valley,Bratcher,"This marches in a completely opposite direction from the oaky, fruity, buttery style of modern Chardonnay. It's bone dry and minerally, with mouthwatering acidity and traces of oranges and limes. The minerality is like a lick of cold steel. What a great food wine at a great price, although production was a paltry 230 cases."
US,83.0,14.0,Yakima Valley,Mount Baker,"This ?Barrel Select??Syrah has been ripened to pruneyness, yet remains short, hot and simple. It could be any red grape left to hang late and fermented at (perhaps) high temperatures."
US,88.0,32.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Two Vintners,"The somewhat prominent herb aromas don't seem varietal. The red-fruit flavors are considerably more germane, though the tannins come off as a bit sticky."
Argentina,82.0,8.0,Mendoza,Region 1,"Orange peel, anise and honey aromas come before a honeyed, soft palate. Flavors of orange, honey and melon are wan, with little finish. This tastes manufactured more than natural."
France,90.0,26.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau de Malleret,"This 1,000-acre estate with 140 acres of vines is close to Bordeaux and still family owned. With bitter chocolate flavor lying over the fruit, this needs some aging before it can properly integrate. Dark tannins and spice show at the end, along with juicy black-currant fruit. Drink from 2018."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Sicilia,Abbazia Santa Anastasia,"Nero d'Avola and Merlot are blended to produce a ripe, chewy wine with mature fruit flavors. The nose is a bit muddled and dense but the wine offers good succulence and depth."
US,85.0,20.0,Virginia,Chateau Morrisette,"This light-bodied, Bordeaux-style red blend is tart red currant driven on the palate, with darker shades of black plum skin speckled with black pepper. Soft tannins and vibrant acidity make this an easy-drinking, enjoyable everyday red."
US,87.0,24.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Goose Ridge,"This wine is half Viognier with the rest Grenache Blanc and Roussanne. It offers aromas of almond, lees and peach. It's unctuous in feel but lighter in style with a touch of bitterness that distracts."
Argentina,80.0,12.0,MaipÃº,Pascual Toso,"This is the first TorrontÃ©s from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds. This is a borderline dud, with chunky, hollow flavors and a mealy finish. Not a total mess but not a good, vivacious Argentine Torrontes by any stretch."
US,87.0,19.0,Napa Valley,Blondie,"Even though this is a bit one dimensional, it's delicious, polished and appealing, offering flamboyant tropical fruit, butterscotch, buttered toast and spice flavors."
US,94.0,85.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"Named for the winery's co-proprietor and founder, Lynn's is powerfully graceful, much like the man himself, offering seamless texture and length. Full bodied and complex, it's structured and ripely satisfying in its mix of black tea, grenadine and feral evocations of a walk in the woods."
Spain,89.0,59.0,Rioja,CVNE,"Earthy, roasted berry aromas are matched by tobacco, cedar and rooty notes. This feels chunky and tomatoey. Flavors of earthy, stewed berry fruits are mature and carry a stalky accent. The finish is medium-long and peppery, with a fading fruit character."
US,92.0,48.0,Dry Creek Valley,Armida,"A field blend of 80% Zinfandel, 18% Petite Sirah and 2% Mixed Blacks, this wine offers a wealth of flavor and likability, from its velvety bouquet of red berry to its vivacious acidity and soft texture. Bright and soft, it has length and complexity to boot."
US,91.0,21.0,Sierra Foothills,Lynch Wines,"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019."
France,88.0,63.0,Santenay,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,This wine is ripe with generous strawberry flavors and perfumed acidity. A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.
US,88.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Sol Rouge,"From two vineyards on the eastern side of the valley, including one on Howell Mountain, this small-production wine offers whiffs of leather saddle and black currant around softened tannins and crÃ¨me-de-cassis-like sweetness, especially on the nose."
US,91.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Diatom,"Greg Brewer goes for full restraint on this bottling, which offers extremely tight aromas of citrus and wet rocks, only barely revealing that it's a Chardonnay. The flavors are similarly restrained, with lemongrass and guava barely peeking out. Yet the texture is sublime and tightly wound, lifted by a fresh acidity."
US,86.0,35.0,Carneros,Schug,"This is ripe in cherry and red currant flavors, with a smoky, bacony touch from the charred oak. The mouthfeel is marked by edgy tannins. Drink now."
US,92.0,100.0,Willamette Valley,Elk Cove,"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration?more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018??025."
US,91.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Efeste,"It's pure Cabernet Sauvignon, dense, dark and what might be called brooding. Despite the massive fruit, the darker notes of black olive and earth are not submerged in sweetness. In fact, there are Stag's Leap-like flavors of rock and mineral. Along with the sleek cassis and black cherry, come highlights of bitter chocolate."
Australia,93.0,49.0,Southern Fleurieu,Salomon Estate,"Austrian Bert Salomon has turned out a wonderful Grenache-based blend. Potent cherry-berry fruit and ample spice (licorice, mocha and pepper) combine in a plump midpalate and linger on the velvety finish."
France,89.0,26.0,Rivesaltes,M. Chapoutier,"Dark, decadent notes of dried cherry and fig lead the bouquet of this seductive wine, with supporting notes of wood spice, cocoa powder, pressed purple flowers and rum raisin adding depth and character. The medium-weight palate boasts velvety tannins and rich black-fruit flavors that finish full and chocolaty."
US,86.0,22.0,El Dorado,Holly's Hill,"This wine packs a big wallop of superripe flavors, so it doesn't taste as petite as its name. Aromas like raisins and rhubarb lead to deep, overripe fruit flavors recalling prunes and dried cherries. An overall feeling of full body persists, but without much tannin to support it."
US,93.0,75.0,Santa Barbara County,Jaffurs,"The highly anticipated best barrel blend from this pioneering Syrah producer offers bright blueberry and black currant aromas, enlivened by white pepper, lavender, milk chocolate and caramel. Violet floral notes power the attack, followed by waves of ripe purple fruit and cola, sarsaparilla and cocoa flavors. It's a crowd-pleaser: sultry and lush yet intensely focused."
US,89.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Vine Cliff,"Aging may make this Cabernet more harmonious than it is now. It's a dramatic wine, ripe in blackberries and cassis, rich in oak, and with smooth, intricate tannins. Yet it's klutzy now, almost rude, like a gawky teenager who's growing too fast. Give it 4?? years to mellow."
US,89.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,SolÃ©na,"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from SolÃ©na. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016??017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already."
US,90.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Spring Valley Vineyard,"This wine is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot. Aromas of herbs, coffee, barrel spice and cherry are followed by tightly wound tannins and fruit flavors. Give it time to open up."
US,89.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Canoe Ridge,"The aromas of huckleberry, flowers and blueberry are bright, with a dark-chocolate top note. The palate is full bodied and rich, made in a hedonistic style with a tart finish."
US,88.0,37.0,Anderson Valley,Harmonique,"Lots of delicious, upfront fruit in this attractive wine. It features ripe raspberry and cherry flavors, accented with sweet, smoky oak, and finishes dry and spicy, with a good cut of acidity for balance. Drink now??013."
Spain,89.0,30.0,Ribera del Duero,Salcis,"Stewy berry and melted chocolate aromas are ultra oaky and creamy. A tannic, heavy mouthfeel and borderline overripe flavors of prune, chocolate and tobacco finish raisiny and baked. Drink through 2020."
US,94.0,108.0,St. Helena,B Cellars,"This 100% varietal wine from the Lewelling Vineyard is a blockbuster, providing a showy demonstration of ripe richness that's gorgeously lush. Christmas plum pudding, clove and cinnamon lurk behind a chalky underbelly of firm tannin and black licorice, finishing fresh in the glass."
France,94.0,62.0,Sancerre,Domaine Vincent Delaporte,"From the intensely steep Monts DamnÃ©s vineyard, this wine is rich and full of ripe tropical and citrus fruits, with a tight line in steely minerality. It's still too structured and firm, so drink from 2016."
Spain,88.0,32.0,Alella,Alta Alella,"Aromas of aged cheese, leather, latex and medicinal cherry and plum lead to a juicy, acid-driven palate with buttery oak as the offset. Flavors of oak-related butter, popcorn and saline push this creamy red toward the finish line, but all the while fruit is secondary to oak. Drink through 2018."
France,92.0,65.0,Champagne,Voirin-Jumel,"Named after the street number of the producer's winery, this Champagne is mineral and dry. It has fine acidity, along with citrus fruits and a crisp aftertaste. The texture is tangy, taut and gives the wine its food friendly character. Drink now."
US,88.0,20.0,North Coast,Z. Alexander Brown,"Wonderful blackberry and ripe grape flavors fill up this big but smooth new wine under country-music star Zac Brown's label. It has a very dark color, jammy aromas, rather sweet flavors and a velvety texture with enough tannin to keep it appetizing."
US,94.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Hertelendy,"Fermented in all new French oak, this wine opens with an enchanting nose of floral beauty and freshness. Its sophistication follows through on the rich, balanced palate of caramel, papaya and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, the lushness countered by a stony grit."
France,87.0,35.0,Moulis-en-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Lalaudey,"Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
US,87.0,18.0,Rogue Valley,Weisinger,"A bright copper color, this is done in a French style, with an emphasis less on freshness than on more mature flavors. Impressions of rose water, cracker and orange liqueur contribute to the mix. This wine should be consumed now through 2016."
US,86.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Olema,"Dry and robust, this has tannins that scour, giving a rough edge to the blackberry fruit."
US,87.0,9.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Hyatt,"You may or may not fancy the blue bottle, but the juice inside is a good example of Yakima Valley Riesling. Tea, honey and lemon flavors are co-mingled; and the 5% residual sugar adds sweetness without becoming grainy or cloying."
US,87.0,45.0,St. Helena,Chase,"Spicy and sweet, this Zin, from century-old vines, has quintessential varietal flavors of wild red and black berries, chocolate, thyme, cedar and pepper. Drink now for its youthful charm."
US,87.0,24.0,Umpqua Valley,Reustle,"The scents and flavors suggest pink grapefruit, apple and pear, dusted with cinnamon. It's round and spicy, with moderate acidity and a touch of residual sugar."
France,90.0,25.0,Bandol,La Bastide Blanche,"This is a full and creamy wine, with an abundance of fruit flavors. Notes of white pear and apricot are portrayed in this ripe and warm feeling wine. The acidity and mandarine zest notes provide crispness and structure. Drink from 2014."
US,85.0,13.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mercer Canyons,"This was 40% barrel-fermented, and carries a whiff of oak in the aroma. Apple scents and flavors follow. It's fresh, forward and fruity, with simple, straightforward flavors."
France,90.0,60.0,Meursault,ChÃ¢teau de Santenay,"Full and round, this wine is fruity while smooth and rich. A layer of crisp acidity is surrounded by the generous white and yellow fruits, accented by a touch of toast and spice. Drink this wine from 2018."
Italy,86.0,10.0,Chianti Colli Senesi,Tenuta di Trecciano,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this easygoing, friendly red opens with aromas of fresh plum and crushed blue flowers. The juicy palate offers up fleshy black cherry, raspberry and a hint of Mediterranean herb alongside round, soft tannins. Enjoy soon."
Spain,91.0,65.0,Bierzo,Demencia de Autor,"Dark, compact and black, with graphite and growling blackberry aromas. Feels tight and drawing but serious and structured, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and spice flavors. Blackened as well on the finish, with mint and toast. Hold until 2015."
US,88.0,18.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Cor Cellars,"With the two varieties co-fermented in concrete, this has no oak to interfere with its aromas of spice, pear and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, seeming a bit sweeter than recent vintages, but still bringing the acidity that this region is known for."
US,88.0,20.0,Paso Robles,San Simeon,"Warm yellow apple, light custard and white peach combine for a creamy nose on this bottling from the Riboli family's new estate vineyard. The sip starts with a sizzle of acidity and then shows flavors of caramelized green apples and a touch of banana, proving both a tad tart and a tad rich."
US,93.0,27.0,Napa Valley,Titus,"A beautiful Zinfandel, softly tannic and lush, and showing how Napa Valley dominates the variety when it comes to balance and elegance. The ultra-refined tannins frame flavors of berry jam, currants, mocha, licorice and pepper. This is really a superior Zinfandel."
US,90.0,15.0,Oregon,A to Z,"Just a hint of sweetness?mostly from ripe fruit rather than residual sugar?livens up this fresh and fruity Riesling. It's a mouthful of lemon, lime and peach fruit flavors, supple and fleshy. A streak of English breakfast tea adds interest through the finish."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Alto Adige,J. Hofstatter,"A spicy, creamy wine that manages to give freshness and intense varietal character at the same time. The overall effect is of lightness and elegance as well as spiciness and richness."
Spain,89.0,18.0,Ribera del Duero,Catania,"Ripe berry, black cherry and leather aromas come together nicely in front of a creamy palate with just enough acid-tannin tension. Lightly herbal, spicy blackberry flavors are savory rather than dark and fruity. The wine tastes spicy and peppery on a finish that feels right."
US,90.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brander,"A lush bouquet of cooked strawberries, black cherry sauce and just a touch of allspice kick off this fun, drink-me-now wine from Santa Ynez Valley pioneer Fred Brander. Good acidity and smooth tannins reminiscent of plum skin surround a fruity palate, which boasts a flavorful arc."
US,93.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Buena Vista,"Earthy cherry and cardamom instantly attract the nose and palate of this wine, flirty and floral in classically varietal aromas of forest floor and wild truffle. Juicy acidity keeps it alive and vibrant as it opens and develops, offering a welcome twist of tangerine in the background."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"Scents of bacon fat from the new French oak introduce a tight young wine. The cured meat aromas and flavors somehow suggest a splash of Syrah in the blend, though none is noted. Give it a couple more years to smooth out and let the fruit come through."
Spain,87.0,30.0,Rioja,Olivier RiviÃ¨re,"Dusty, minerally white-fruit aromas are generic but appealing. This blend of Viura, Malvasia and Garnacha Blanca has a chunky palate with modest acidity. Green-melon flavors are round but flatten out and turn slightly bitter in front of a basic finish."
US,91.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"This is three fifths Merlot, the rest spread among the other four Bordeaux grapes. It's very well crafted, showing a bit of herb along with berries and spice. What most impresses is the overall structure, and the impression of ageworthy muscle in the finish."
US,93.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Testarossa,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate."
US,88.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Alpha Omega,"Cabernet specialist Alpha Omega is increasingly showing a knack with Sauvignon Blanc. This vintage shows crisp acidity and a dry palate with flavors of citrus, tropical fruit, grass, honey and oak."
US,92.0,24.0,Edna Valley,Wolff,"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous."
US,90.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Januik,"The aromas are bright, with notes of green herb, vanilla, clove, wood spice and cherry. The palate brings a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors along with barrel accents, providing a whole lot of texture and appeal."
US,87.0,25.0,North Fork of Long Island,Raphael,"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011."
France,88.0,10.0,Minervois,ChÃ¢teau Cabezac,"There's no shortage of spice in this value Minervois, with strong notes of pepper and garrigue herbs backed by notes of orange rind, red cherry and young raspberry. Medium-light in the mouth with moderate acidity and soft tannins; drink up now."
US,93.0,175.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"This is a funky briny wine that still seems a bit closed up on first pour. The palate is silky and focused, not having fully come together as of yet but still offering generous fruit, smoked meat and other savory flavors. It's all about elegance."
France,89.0,45.0,Ladoix,Louis Jadot,"Better known for its red wines, Ladoix's whites are a rarity. This wine is made from fruit sourced from vines that are close to the Corton hill. It is steely, minerally and crisp, with a wood-influenced character. With its structure, this needs at least three years of aging."
Spain,85.0,22.0,Sierra de Salamanca,La Zorra,"Earthy aromas of roasted red plum blend with scents of latex and cured meat on a jumbled nose. Like any Rufete, this feels drawing and rubbery, with choppy tannins. Flavors of tomato, currant and red plum are tart and narrow on a drawing finish."
France,83.0,15.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Les Petits,"The wine, with its dry tannins, is dense while unfocussed. It will remain tannin dominated."
France,90.0,18.0,Tavel,Chateau de Manissy,"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosÃ© over the rest of 2017."
Spain,87.0,16.0,Jumilla,Juan Gil,"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short."
Italy,88.0,74.0,Barolo,Azienda Agricola Cogno,"Elegant but gripping, with cherry, violet and leather notes on the nose, followed by a rapberry and rose-infused palate. Black earth and berry notes flavor the long finish. The very austere tannins will need until 2012 to come around."
US,92.0,60.0,St. Helena,Parry Cellars,"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Trentino,Mezzacorona,"There's a buttery, creamy banana feeling to this Grigio that gives the wine dimension and personality. A creamy consistency characterizes its texture and the wine achieves a wonderful balance between pulp and acidity."
US,92.0,30.0,Santa Maria Valley,QupÃ©,"A charming Chardonnay, not the biggest, baddest around, but crisp and linear and elegant. Shows saline, umami-infused lime, Meyer lemon and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e flavors, with zesty acidity. Finishes balanced and complex."
US,87.0,18.0,Amador County,Drytown,"Oodles of black cherry and boysenberry fill the aromas and flavors of this bold but not-too-big wine. The rich, ripe fruit shows right away in the nose, and continues on the palate but gets reined in a bit (in a good way) by a firm texture created by good acidity and tannins."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Terre Siciliane,Cantine Ermes,"This extremely simple white offers subdued tropical fruit and citrus aromas that carry over to the light, rather diluted palate. It's lean and racy, with brisk acidity."
US,89.0,25.0,Dry Creek Valley,Fritz,"Almost entirely fermented in stainless steel, it has unquestionable acidity captured in the bottle, without a sacrifice of ripe, juicy peach fruit. Lemongrass lingers on the tail end."
US,93.0,21.0,Lodi,Bokisch,"Bokisch has made a Tempranillo that's relatively light in body, bursting with an earthy tobacco tone, with a backbone of leather. The palate feels velvety, with soft but structured tannins, bearing black cherry and dark chocolate flavors. This has to be one of California's best Tempranillos."
US,91.0,12.0,Mendocino County,Castle Rock,"This smells and tastes like a pale Pinot Noir and has some of the body and smooth texture of a red wine, too. Tasty cinnamon, nutmeg and red-cherry flavors get plenty of uplift from zingy acidity, so the balance is great and the finish lingers."
France,90.0,40.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Michel Picard,"Big and opulent, this has ripe tropical fruits, with a soft, toasty texture and full-bodied feel. With its richness, this is developing quickly and is already ready to drink."
US,84.0,20.0,Mendocino,Brutocao,"Dry and soft, this is a pretty Merlot to drink with lusty fare, like barbecued pork and tri-tip. It has tannin-inspired flavors of black cherries, red currants, mocha, bacon and spice. Drink now."
US,86.0,12.0,Paso Robles,Villa San Juliette,"A very nice, likeable and super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, at an everyday price. Nicely crisp and just slightly sweet, it shows fruity flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, pears and melons."
Italy,89.0,24.0,Cerasuolo di Vittoria,Planeta,"Aromas recall ripe black fruit and a whiff of game. The round palate offers ripe cherry, graphite, crushed blackberry and touch of white pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2016."
France,93.0,107.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,Domaine Clarence Dillon,"Fresh citrus and tangy orange give this perfumed wine both fruitiness and a tight, mineral texture. It has enough structure to age; drink from 2018. This bottling is a blend of second-level white grapes from two Domaine Dillon properties: ChÃ¢teau Haut-Brion and ChÃ¢teau La Mission Haut-Brion, both in Pessac-LÃ©ognan."
US,92.0,175.0,Napa Valley,Black Cordon,"Made in limited quantities by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this is 100% varietal from a single vineyard, aged entirely in new French oak. Soft and malleable tannins manage its tangy, succulent blue fruit, supporting all that full-bodied ripeness and girth."
US,87.0,21.0,Paso Robles,Pear Valley,"Orange, nectarine, canned pear and honeysuckle show on the nose of this quaffable bottling. The palate is nicely creamy but not overly thick, with banana cream and pear-mousse flavors that grow increasingly tropical as the sip lingers."
US,84.0,13.0,Iowa,Jasper,"An inventive blend of Catawba and Marachel Foch, a French-American hybrid between Goldriesling and an American vine called vitis riparia, this rosÃ© has a heavily perfumed nose and a slightly clumsy combination of sweetness and spicy red. Still, the wine has a fresh finish and some structure that recommends it to myriad food pairings."
US,90.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Boundary Breaks,"While demure on the nose, this dry, seemingly diminutive Riesling builds in power and concentration on the palate. It's fairly low in alcohol, with an unassuming gradation of flavors ranging from lime to lemon and grapefruit, but its rippling textural expanse lends persistence and gravitas."
US,93.0,45.0,Santa Maria Valley,Timbre,"Josh Klapper made six barrels of this wine from coveted old vines at Bien Nacido Vineyard. The result is an exciting, focused expression of minerality, with wet cement prominent on the nose alongside black cherry, alpine strawberry and a touch of vanilla dust. Light and lithe in mouthfeel yet still packed with tons of flavor, the old vines unleash cranberry, pomegranate, orange rind, thyme, bay leaf and eucalyptus flavors."
Italy,87.0,105.0,Barolo,Rocche dei Manzoni,"Aromas of oak, coconut, burned rubber and scorched earth lead the nose. The rather lean palate offers vanilla, licorice and a confectionary note while astringent tannins dry out the finish."
Italy,91.0,38.0,Valtellina Superiore,Dirupi,"Alluring scents of wild berry, Alpine herb, pine forest and wild flower lead the nose on this vibrant linear red. On the elegant luminous palate, a mineral vein underscores red cherry, strawberry, star anise and cedar. Firm acidity and taut refined tannins provide the framework. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019??025."
US,85.0,27.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"Ripe tangerine, peach jam, vanilla and oak flavors are penetrating in this soft, creamy Chardonnay. It's a ripe, rich wine that's widely appealing."
France,86.0,15.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Vignerons de Mancey,"This ripe, creamy wine has apricot flavors laced with citrus acidity. Lightly textured, it is still developing and needs to age for the next few months. Drink from the end of 2016."
US,89.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Roco,"The Stalker is made by drying the stalks before embarking on whole berry fermentation. It's good to go, with bright cherry-candy flavors, light spices and a tart cranberry kick to the finish."
France,94.0,67.0,Champagne,Louis Roederer,"A beautiful orange pink-colored wine. Young and fresh, it has great depth of raspberry and red fruit flavors as well as a delicious summer fruit brightness and liveliness. A beautiful Champagne, that will repay some bottle aging."
France,88.0,16.0,Vouvray,ChÃ¢teau Moncontour,"As happens with Chenin wines, this has closed up, showing only marzipan flavors without the fruit. It's a stage, and the wine needs another 2?? years before realizing its mature potential. Screwcap."
US,85.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Knapp,"Sweet pea blossoms and fresh apples make this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay quite floral on the nose, but the palate is decidedly savory with a pleasantly creamy palate marked by brisk apple flavors, bright acidity and a smoked nut finish."
US,84.0,15.0,Lake County,Guenoc,"Distinctly sugary, which gives the blackberries and cherries a jammy sweetness. But it's clean and crisp. For those who like this style, it's pretty good."
Italy,89.0,27.0,Valli di Porto Pino,Cantina Santadi,"Made with 85% Carignano and 15% Syrah, this boasts aromas of mature black cherry, raspberry and Mediterranean herb. The soft palate doles out ripe black currant, licorice and black pepper alongside velvety tannins."
US,88.0,36.0,Napa Valley,St. Clement,"Here's a big, lush Cab, appealing now for its jammy blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. But the tannins make for an unsettled astringency that needs rich meats to cut through. Fine now with complex beef dishes, but better after 2010."
US,85.0,15.0,North Coast,X,"A little on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, and front-loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle and spicy vanilla flavors. Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Blanc, Chardonnay and Roussanne."
US,89.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Renteria,"Rich and full bodied, this is delicious to drink now for its array of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and toast flavors. The tannins are just a bit jagged, so give it a few hours in the decanter."
France,86.0,35.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine Ferret,"This wine is crisp and fruity. It has attractive acidity, a nice touch of spice and a backbone of minerality. The juiciness leaves a bright, crisp aftertaste."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Altos Las Hormigas,"Dry, briary, leathery aromas come in front of a high-acid palate that's almost shocking in its zestiness. Tart but generic flavors of cherry and red plum finish with a skins-like texture and lasting acidity."
Italy,85.0,17.0,Moscato d'Asti,Tenuta Olim Bauda,"Freshness and deep floral fragrances emerge from the foamy and creamy nose of this well-made Moscato d'Asti. It delivers a soft, plush feel in the mouth and would pair with dried biscuits or sponge cake."
Australia,87.0,25.0,McLaren Vale,5OS Project,"This wine shows ripe dark fruit, cedar, intense whole-bunch stalkiness and a perfumed quality throughout. The tannins are clunky and soapy while the alcohol feels a little hot."
US,87.0,60.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Miner,"Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new. The wine would benefit from a firmer texture, though, as it's on the soft, one-dimensional side."
Italy,97.0,100.0,Barolo,Mascarello Giuseppe e Figlio,"Enticing aromas of iris, rose, perfumed red berry and cake spice emerge on this stunning wine. The elegantly structured, silky palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, mint, white pepper and tobacco alongside firm but ultrafine tannins. It's already tempting but hold to let it unwind and develop more complexity. Drink 2018??035."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Borgoluce,"A consistent producer in the wide word of Italian sparkling wines, Borgoluce always delivers clean and pristine wines with a steady and cheerful quality of perlage. There's a little extra pulp and density here in the form of sweet peach and lemon mousse."
US,90.0,28.0,Sonoma,Sheldon,"This is a breath of fresh air, a single-vineyard designate sparkler made from Tempranillo that's refreshing and salty. Dry, it tastes of gelato, pomegranate, raspberry, cherry and strawberry?swirls of light-bodied flavor that replenish the palate with every sip."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Campo de Borja,Penelope Sanchez,"Heavy oak aromas rest forcefully on top of plum and black cherry scents. This is fresh and proper in feel, with dominant oaky graininess and medicinal berry flavors that finish woody like a plank."
US,90.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Helix by Reininger,"Holding 42% MourvÃ¨dre, 31% Cinsault and 27% Grenache, this full-bodied wine has aromas of peppery spices, herbs and jammy red and black fruit. Flavors are sweet and ripe, with restrained oak."
US,88.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Terra Vina Wines,"This barrel-forward wine offers aromas of caramel, vanilla, green wood and cocoa along with cherry. The milk chocolate and cherry flavors are sweet and luscious. It could use a bit more structure to hold it all together but it brings plenty of appeal."
US,80.0,25.0,Temecula Valley,Monte De Oro,"A RhÃ´ne-style blend of mostly Grenache and MourvÃ©dre, with smaller amounts of Syrah and Cinsault, the wine is prune-like and overdone."
US,88.0,45.0,Carneros,Etude,"A larger-production wine that doesn't hold back on quality, this offers a bittersweet bite of black tea, cranberry and dried herb atop aromas of dried rose petals, remaining varietal while also providing an oomph of body and texture."
US,85.0,48.0,Sonoma Valley,Keating,"This is a soft, still grippy Cabernet with an earthy, tobacco-infused character that somewhat overwhelms the taste of blackberry and black currant."
US,90.0,28.0,Alexander Valley,Stuhlmuller Vineyards,"Here's a very rich, elaborate wine that defines the modern, ripe style of Zinfandel. You certainly can't complain about the fruit, which is massive in red and black berry and stone fruit flavors, sprinkled with black pepper, cinnamon and star anise. It's a little hot and sweet in alcohol, but then again, this is an Alexander Valley Zin."
France,90.0,72.0,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,"With time, fresh rose petals merge into heady Turkish delight notes on the nose. This is full-on Gewurztraminer with all the bells and whistles: utterly decadent rose water and honeysuckle notes are submerged in rich, indulgent sweetness. This is perfumed and full-on: a super-charged varietal expression with rich, powdery layers of rose, honey and caramel."
Italy,89.0,68.0,Terre Siciliane,Passopisciaro,"Crushed stone, clove, dark-skinned berry and Mediterranean herb aromas emerge. The palate is rather shy, offering sour cherry, licorice, white pepper and mineral framed in firm acidity and assertive, fine-grained tannins."
Italy,81.0,12.0,Chianti Rufina,Colognole,"This is a big burly wine that just has too many off aromas. Heavy barnyard scents mix with tart berry and espresso elements, and although there's body here, and what seem to be basically good elements, the stable-like odors stop the show."
Italy,85.0,17.0,Beneventano,Cantina del Taburno,"This Coda di Volpe has a subdued nose that lets aromas of chopped herb and mineral reveal themselves slowly. It's tonic and firm with good crispness and an easy overall approach. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
US,88.0,17.0,Napa County,Michael Pozzan,"A perfectly fine Cabernet, with ripe blackberry, black currant and herb flavors. Does a good job at a fair price."
Italy,86.0,12.0,Sicilia,Cusumano,"This opens with a pretty white-flower and honey notes, followed by a thick and slightly heavy mouthfeel. Barbecued shrimp would make for a great pairing partner."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Rueda,Esperanza,"Generic white-fruit aromas of peach and apple are slightly pithy. This feels good but innocuous, while flavors of apple and stone fruits lose some of their snap and directness on a tropical-tasting finish."
US,93.0,52.0,Amador County,AratÃ¡s,"AratÃ¡s puts more bottle age on their Petite Sirah than most, and the extra maturity shows. Wonderful oak spices fill the aroma and extend into the fully ripe and richly fruity flavors of this big but beautifully sculpted wine. It has a lot of new oak influence and that is perfect to match the big body and monumental tannins that give the wine such impact."
Spain,82.0,9.0,CariÃ±ena,Las Valles,"Jammy, herbal aromas come with a note of orange peel. The palate feels choppy and rough, while flavors of medicinal red berry and herbal influences end in a light, candied, green-tasting finish."
Italy,87.0,38.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, yellow apple skin and a confectionery note. The aromas carry over to the firm palate along with butterscotch and a mineral note but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the dominant oak sensations."
Argentina,86.0,18.0,Mendoza,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Dusty apricot and melon aromas come with plenty of oak and vanilla. The palate is on the flat and creamy side, with peachy acidity. Flavors of mild citrus, vanilla and wood resin finish with additional vanilla notes and a hint of papaya."
France,89.0,23.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Maison du Midi,"Importer and Master Sommelier Fran Kysela uses the Maison du Midi label for lots of RhÃ´ne wines he selects to bring into the U.S. This effort, from Plan de Dieu, is seriously intense, full-bodied and firmly tannic, showing the character of the vintage. The plummy fruit is powerful, fighting through the tannins on the finish. Try it young with rare beef, or put it away for a few years and see if the tannins soften over time."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Storks' Tower,"Crisp and likable, this smells stony and snappy, with spring pea, passion fruit and citrus aromas. It feels well cut, with green bean, grass and citrus flavors. While it hints at being vegetal, it maintains a consistent white-fruit and citrus profile."
US,82.0,22.0,California,Big House,"The price is right, but the wine is a little vegetal despite some cherry and currant flavors. Will do in a pinch, if your guests aren't particular."
US,91.0,48.0,Willamette Valley,WillaKenzie Estate,"This selection is from the winery's first planted vineyard, now nearing 20 years of age. It's all Pommard clone, offering a burst of pretty cherry fruit backed with stiff tannins and a streak of iron. Still showing some sharp edges, it's just out of 15 months in 50% new oak, and will benefit from aerating or further bottle age."
US,87.0,18.0,Dry Creek Valley,Bedarra,"Sometimes, you just want a white that's dry, crisp and mouth-cleansing, to wash down that chicken salad sandwich or drink with savory hors d'oeuvres. This Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay blend fills that need admirably. It's dry and rich in citrus fruits, with stimulating acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one up."
Argentina,92.0,50.0,Mendoza,Gimenez Riili,"Grapy, jammy boysenberry and blueberry aromas are exotic, with integrated barrel and spice notes. This feels weighty but balanced; flavors of blueberry, currant and chocolate finish with plum-like juiciness and length. Drink through 2021."
Italy,92.0,43.0,Toscana,Caparzo,"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of cedar, violet, underbrush and dark berry. The elegantly structured palate delivers black cherries, red currants, black pepper and anise alongside smooth, integrated tannins. Drink through 2018."
France,94.0,124.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Domaine Faiveley,This beautiful wine has great potential. It already shows good balance between the acidity and ripe yellow fruits that are woven into the toasty texture and the spice. The wine will take time to develop but will become impressive. Drink from 2022.
US,82.0,25.0,California,Black Box,"Unusually dry and tangy, this light-bodied wine smells like celery and herbs, and tastes very lean and straightforward."
Argentina,93.0,140.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Achaval-Ferrer,"Dusty cherry, wild berry and minerally aromas comprise a compact, deep nose that's entirely inviting. Juicy, bold and bright on the palate, with sturdy tannins, this offers exotic notes of cumin and baking spices along with wild berry flavors. It's elegant, complete and thorough on the finish; drink through 2020."
US,92.0,18.0,Santa Maria Valley,Alta Maria,"The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosÃ© should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros."
US,91.0,75.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Betz Family,"Aromas of dried herb, bay leaf, spice, dried flowers and dark fruit are followed by tart, spritely cranberry and cherry flavors. It possesses a real sense of freshness and elegance."
Australia,87.0,17.0,Yarra Valley,Sticks,"Nicely balanced, this is the sort of restrained Cab Sauvignon Yarra Valley can do well, with hints of mint and eucalyptus layered over cassis fruit. The texture is creamy, the tannins smooth. It's not as rich as the 2003, or a barrel sample of the 2006, but it's well crafted and harmonious."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Wagner,"More mineral than fruit, this delicately concentrated rosÃ© offers glimpses of tart cherry and citrus flavor augmented by a backbone of fresh acidity. It's invigorating and spry with a lean dry finish."
France,85.0,16.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Grand Nicolet,"This Rasteau-based estate has turned out a plummy, savory blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan aged solely in concrete. The plum fruit is pronounced, balanced by hints of asphalt and some dusty tannins on the finish."
US,93.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Mumm Napa,"This is the winery's highest quality wine, named in honor of their late winemaker, Guy Devaux, who brought a Champagne sensibility to the brand. At the age of eight years, it's softly complex and delicious in lime, raspberry, yeasty brioche and vanilla flavors. It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes a fine sparkling wine so special."
France,87.0,15.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de Sadran,"A solid and fully tannic wine that also has a bright, fruity side. The combination, with its ripe fruit, is already a pleasure to drink fresh, textured and juicy. The wine also has a future with a smoky character that will allow it to age. So drink until 2021."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Asolo Prosecco Superiore,Bele Casel,"This has a simple, streamlined mouthfeel backed by subtle tones of stone fruit and citrus. Overall, this feels fresh and easy."
Spain,89.0,44.0,Ribera del Duero,Campos GÃ³ticos,"Rugged, rustic, stalky aromas are a bit challenging. In the mouth, this is stout and tough, with hard tannins. Toasty blackberry flavors are mildly stalky and earthy, with peppery bitterness, while a firm, tight, tannic finish tastes of black peppercorn and blackberry. Drink through 2028."
France,92.0,25.0,Morgon,ChÃ¢teau de Pizay,"From the famed slope of the CÃ´tes de Py, this wine sums up both the great terroir and a great vintage. It has structure, with dry tannins permeating the ripe, rounded fruit. Its potential is considerable, anchored in great fruitiness and finishing acidity. Drink from 2019."
US,86.0,35.0,Rogue Valley,Foris,"Vibrantly fruity, it offers aromas of currant, raspberry, celery stalk and spice. The palate has tart cranberry flavors, finishing a bit short."
Argentina,83.0,22.0,Mendoza,Finca Agostino,"Rustic and stemmy, with burnt, nutty aromas leading to a thick palate of stemmy black fruit flavors. Herbal, tannic and stemmy throughout, so at least there's continuity between the nose, palate and finish."
US,87.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Spindrift Cellars,"Quite ripe and fruity, this full-bodied wine brings apple, pear and peach fruit in abundance. It's almost over-the-top, with some noticeable heat on the finish."
US,91.0,34.0,Napa Valley,Terra Valentine,"A more approachable combo of mostly Cabernet with 20% Merlot, this wine is rounder and softer on the palate than some of its vineyard-designated brethren, and yet still appropriately grippy for the vintage. Plum, chocolate, cedar and leather all make appearances, as the wine expands into a luxurious finish. Drink now through 2020."
US,90.0,35.0,Applegate Valley,Cowhorn,"A firm, young, compact, nicely sculpted wine, this shows pinpoint fruit flavors of quince and pear. There are subtle highlights of gin-like botanicals, and the flavors penetrate clean and clear all the way through a lingering finish."
US,87.0,45.0,Virginia,Fabbioli Cellars,"An amalgam of 85% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this sports leather and blackberry aromas. The medium-bodied palate comes with tight, finely plaited tannins, and the boosted acids give the wine spine."
Italy,87.0,14.0,Chianti,Cantine Ravazzi,"This blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Ciliegiolo opens with bright aromas of red berry, violet and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The vibrant, easygoing palate brings juicy black cherry, raspberry and a note of clove alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy through 2016."
US,89.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,MacMurray Estate Vineyards,"Seductive aromas of raspberries, sandalwood, graphite and a pinch of allspice entertain the nose on this wine. The spiced wood character carries to the palate, where dried strawberries and pomegranate add riper fruit elements."
US,92.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Santa Barbara Winery,"From the property of a longtime vineyard manager for the winery, this bottling is deliciously unique. The nose abounds with earth, dried cherry, anise, roasted meat and herb aromas. The structure is solid and somewhat gripping, presenting deep red-fruit flavors with dried herb accents, driven by balanced acidity."
US,88.0,20.0,California,Joseph Filippi,"This late-harvest style wine has a rich amber color plus concentrated aromas of honey, toasted nuts and apricot. Sweet, mouthcoating flavors are nutty, spicy and long-lasting on the finish. Fortified for extra body and alcohol, the wine is super sweet."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Delle Venezie,My Moon,Here's a steady value wine from Northern Italy that shows easy aromas of citrus and melon backed by fresh acidity and a lively mouthfeel. Pair this wine with raw mozzarella drizzled with olive oil.
Italy,91.0,100.0,Barolo,Massolino,"Parafada offers a bouquet of prickly fruit such as wild berry, bramble and underbrush. You'll also recognize pretty tones of white truffle, moist earth, new leather and coffee. The wine is bright but still raw in the mouth and ends with mineral notes, a blast of menthol and an interesting powdery texture."
Italy,96.0,79.0,Barbaresco,Sottimano,"This dazzling red is still in its infancy but promises to bloom into a stunning beauty. It opens with delicate aromas of red rose, perfumed berry, forest floor, exotic spice, aromatic herb and a light balsamic note. Energy abounds on the full-bodied, elegant palate, which delivers bright red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and licorice alongside a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2020??040."
US,86.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Maryhill,"Maple, black fruit and cocoa aromas lead to lighter styled dark-fruit flavors. The barrel influence at times seems a bit heavy, with the flavors not able to stand up to it."
US,88.0,34.0,North Fork of Long Island,Jamesport,"Pristine black cherry and plum flavors are layered in swathes of savory dried herbs, char and coffee on this bold, big-bodied red. Juicy red-fruit flavors are unabashedly forward on the palate, but reined in with a shower of revitalizing acidity. It finishes with soft tannins."
US,88.0,52.0,Anderson Valley,Black Kite,"Defines a certain California style in the intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, whose sweetness is accented by caramelized oak. Delicious, and the acidity and tannins are just fine, but it's a little obvious, and wants greater subtlety."
US,90.0,30.0,Dry Creek Valley,Hobo,"Higher in alcohol than Hobo's other '07 Zins, the Treborce is also a bit hotter in the mouth. It has a tug of chili pepper heat with the intensely ripe blackberry, cherry, milk chocolate and spice flavors. Needs barbecue and similar rich fare to do its thing."
France,90.0,17.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Lucien Lardy,"This ripe and rounded wine features soft tannins and generous fruitiness. Cherries dominate along with juicy plums, all cut by acidity. An edge of tannins give weight and a concentrated feel. Drink now, but even better wait until 2015."
US,90.0,45.0,Alexander Valley,Stonestreet,"Sage, brush and pencil shavings make for a savory, gravelly experience on the nose and palate of this full-bodied, high-elevation wine. Robustly tannic, it softens in the glass and on the finish in a stream of black pepper and dried herb."
France,88.0,49.0,Champagne,Charles-Gilbert de VindÃ©,"Producer Michel Gonet has made this 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, using this label exclusively for the American market. It is a soft, ripe wine, well balanced and attractive with white fruits and a touch of citrus. The texture is crisp, leaving a bright, tight aftertaste."
US,91.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole."
US,92.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Soos Creek,"Palisade is Merlot-based in 2010, with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the blend. Muscular and complex, this is Merlot at a level rarely found at this price. Cherry, cassis, earth, graphite and mineral flavors mingle seamlessly. Sourced from a brilliant mix of vineyards including Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, DuBrul and Klipsun."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Sicilia,Donnafugata,"Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit and exotic spice. The straightforward, accessible palate delivers black cherry, ground pepper and a hint of star anise while dusty tannins lend a firm finish. Enjoy soon."
US,90.0,45.0,Napa Valley,William Hill Estate,"This wine offers billowy, bittersweet tannin and a flirtation of gunpowder, highlighted by a ripe, full-bodied midsection of black currant and tobacco leaf. It's well-balanced and flavorful, with a lingering finish."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Verdicchio di Matelica,Capestrano,"There's a distinctive element to this Verdicchio that resembles pressed flower, honey, apricot and fresh pineapple. This is crisp, easy-going and straightforward."
France,88.0,17.0,Cahors,Domaine de Cause,"Red fruits and a soft tannic profile give a ready-to-drink feel. It's generous, balanced, the black fruits giving a sweet, jammy feel. Pepper and spice at the end are paired with juicy acidity."
US,85.0,15.0,Lodi,Christine Andrew,"Dark, dry and full-bodied, as Malbec should be, with blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. It's a lusty wine, but a little sharp through the finish. Drink now."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Umbria,Cirulli,"This blend of Incrocio Manzoni, Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto opens with tutti frutti aromas of ripe banana, pineapple and pear that carry over to the palate, along with mango. The savory palate also has a certain salinity that restrains the exuberant fruit."
US,89.0,35.0,Wahluke Slope,K Vintners,"The Clifton is holding back at the moment, its tannins feel a little scrapey and the fruit is showing a cool-climate aspect, although the Wahluke is generally one of Washington's hot spots. Gravelly and dry, with a long finish that somehow holds your interest long after the fruit has faded."
US,93.0,40.0,Yakima Valley,Doyenne,"Lush, polished and detailed, this is as elegant as any Washington Syrah can be. Intensely fruity with lively raspberries and plums, it layers in details of earth, mushroom, pepper and herb, leading to a perfectly balanced, structured finish."
France,85.0,12.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Albert Bichot,"In this generous, fruity wine, rich flavors are cut by grapefruit acidity and aromatic herbs. The texture is full in the mouth with good refreshing flavors as well a juicy, aftertaste."
France,90.0,60.0,Champagne,Dom Caudron,"Vines that are more than 50 years old are the backbone of this wine. It is called Epicurean, meaning it is made to go with food and its extra dryness, almost extra brut, puts it firmly in that category. Structured and tangy, the wine could do with some more bottle age, so drink from 2017."
France,88.0,12.0,CÃ´tes Catalanes,Penya,"Made from 96% Grenache Noir and 4% Syrah, this is a fresh, pretty and easy to like rosÃ©, with attractive notes of peony, strawberry top, orange blossom and thyme. The mouthfeel is light, but flavorful, with a pleasant citrus-pith and watermelon-rind bitterness that lingers on the finish."
Italy,89.0,70.0,Barolo,Tenimenti Famiglia Cavallero,"Ripe berry, milk chocolate and menthol aromas take shape in the glass. The straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry marinated in spirits and licorice alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Rioja,Valserrano,"Melon, peach and vanilla aromas don't display much oak while coming across clean and ripe. This feels juicy, with orange, tangerine and nectarine flavors. The finish is spunky and acidic but not overly deep or complex. This is 95% Viura and 5% Malvasia."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,Llama,"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way."
US,87.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Cameron Hughes,"California's Cameron Hughes dips a toe into Oregon waters with this quite drinkable Willamette Valley Pinot. It floats light cherry fruit around some woody, herbal, stiff tannins. There's a nice touch of cinnamon spice ringing through the finish."
France,92.0,40.0,Chablis,Simonnet-Febvre,"The wine is fresh, its baked apple and green plum fruit cut with intense citrus. The vineyard, with its pure chalk soil, shows strongly in the minerality and steely texture of the wine, promising aging. Drink this complex wine from 2016."
US,89.0,25.0,Arroyo Seco,Comartin,"Gooseberry and lemon peel mix with a wet cement, stony character on the nose of this crisp sipper from the middle of Monterey County. It's light, bright and tart on the palate, with lime peel, grapefruit peel and grassy tones, all laid across a zesty energy and cement minerality."
Italy,91.0,43.0,Vino Spumante,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Creamy, fresh and delicately scented, this lovely sparkler opens with a fragrance of pressed yellow flowers, mango and a hint of flint. The elegantly structured palate offers nectarine zest, white peach, mineral and a honeyed note are accompanied by bright acidity."
Italy,85.0,14.0,Moscato d'Asti,Umberto Fiore,"The wine opens with a pale hay color and segues to aromas of musky soap, honey and yellow flowers. In the mouth, it delivers delicate sweetness with a foamy creaminess that tastes soft and plush."
France,89.0,24.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Magdeleine Bouhou,"Smooth with polished new wood flavors and fine black fruit, this wine has good potential. Subtle tannins back up its black currant and berry fruit. Drink from 2020."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Rueda,Esperanza,"Aromas of orange zest, apple cider and yeast come in front of a plump, slightly wayward palate with citric acidity. Generic citrus flavors finish lemony but with acidic scour."
US,92.0,48.0,Dundee Hills,Ayoub,"Mostly Thistle fruit, with some Hyland also, this is a blend of lots aged in one stainless barrel, one Champagne barrel, and the rest neutral. The mix works well, crafting a well-defined wine with some chicken-stock flavors modulating strands of lime, citrus and apple. It finishes with light toast and impressive length."
Spain,83.0,40.0,Rioja,Bodegas Valdemar,"Gold in color and lightly oxidized on the nose, and it's still young. Smells heavy and creamy, like hay. Feels flat, with pickled flavors and mealy apple on the finish. Runs plump, sweet and seems like an imposter for Chardonnay."
US,91.0,35.0,Chehalem Mountains,Alloro,"Here's a winning combination of succulent, ripe and tangy cherries, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, and a lingering lick of caramel. It's 100% estate-grown, fermented with native yeast and aged 10 months in 28% new French oak."
France,90.0,33.0,Chablis,Simonnet-Febvre,"This wine is fat, fruity and creamy, with just a touch of minerality. Its ripe fullness lends plenty of depth and concentration, within a lightly structured frame. Drink from 2018."
US,90.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Pike Road,This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins. The immaculate craftsmanship and clean direct flavors are light years beyond budget Pinot Noir from most other regions. This is your perfect salmon wine.
Argentina,91.0,80.0,Perdriel,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Similar in style to the higher-priced Cobos wine from the same vineyard. Bramare delivers cassis, plum and berry aromas rolled into a pleasant and familiar whole. Feels rich but refined, with meaty flavors that hit on leather, berry, black plum and chocolate. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2014."
Italy,89.0,35.0,Chianti Classico,Cecchi,"Wild berry, dark baking spice, aromatic herb and espresso aromas are present along with a floral note. The linear palate offers raw red cherry, dried sage and a white pepper note framed in vibrant acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Sicilia,Cottanera,This rich expression of Nerello Mascalese (a grape native to Sicily's Mount Etna) offers thick density and extraction followed by fresh notes of berry fruit and spice. It ends with chewy tannins and bright cherry flavors.
US,93.0,45.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Sante Arcangeli,"Light in color but bursting with aromas of candied cherry, pencil lead, sauteed porcini mushrooms and rain-soaked gravel, this is a fabulous wine from an oceanview vineyard above Corralitos. Italian spices of oregano and bay leaf combine with a sesame-oil warmth and bright raspberry fruit on the zesty palate."
US,92.0,42.0,Sonoma County,Pride Mountain,"Fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral French oak, this 100% varietal wine lets the fruit take center stage, offering up white peach and apricot in a succulent package. Floral and flinty, it's balanced, with just the slightest notion of vanilla and brioche popping up on the finish."
US,92.0,60.0,Edna Valley,Chamisal Vineyards,"This darkly inclined Pinot Noir is the top-end bottling from one of Edna Valley's premiere producers. Black raspberry, crushed clove and iced tea form the nose. Those midnight elements carry to the palate, with rich blackberry, thick coffee and black tea flavors."
Spain,87.0,9.0,CariÃ±ena,Valcantara,"This young Garnacha is fresh and fruity, and entirely approachable and likable given the price. The palate is fairly smooth and medium in weight, with blackberry flavors that fade to darkness on the finish. This was made for everyday sipping."
US,88.0,38.0,Sonoma County,Buena Vista,"This wine pushes the envelope on ripeness, not unusual for the variety. Toasted oak and black-cherry jam make up the majority of the experience, riding a supple wave of soft tannin and concentrated power."
France,90.0,27.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,"From mainly clay soil, this is a rich and rounded wine. It starts soft and generous; the structure, intense fruits and acidity only slowly come through. It's smooth, rich and concentrated, ready to drink from 2016."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Barbera d'Asti,Damilano,"This youthful expression of Barbera comes forth with ripe and raw aromas of black fruit, plum, prune and wild berries. You really feel the freshness of the fruit here and this wine would pair perfectly with pasta or pizza."
US,90.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Landmark,"There's a ying-yang of rich crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout."
France,90.0,24.0,Cahors,Georges Vigouroux,"Dense and concentrated, with a mint flavor from the new wood, this is a wine that combines rich plum and blackberry flavors with firm tannins and juicy acids. Because it is so rich, it is likely to be ready to be drink in the next 2?? years."
France,96.0,29.0,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,"A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate. On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity. Drink 2017??037."
US,88.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Fess Parker,"A touch of vanilla, butter and seared lemons characterize the nose of this wine that also shows pears and apples, making it a solid Chardonnay alternative. The palate offers a hint of marzipan along with juicy lemon pulp and zest as well as richer stone-fruit elements in the midpalate."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Massimo Daldin,"Here's a bright wine that opens with aromas of white field flowers, pears and a hint of nut. The straightforward palate offers yellow apple and a hint of bitter almond alongside fresh acidity."
US,87.0,25.0,El Dorado,Steiner Family Vineyards,"Almost black in color, this full-bodied wine is bold in aroma, smelling like black pepper and blackberry, with a slightly earthy edge. It tastes dense, rich but dry. A thick coat of tannins leads to an astringent finish."
France,87.0,83.0,Champagne,Ruinart,"Fragrant; dusty plum and rose aromas are followed on the palate by very fruity flavors of cherries and apple skins. The fine bead and rich mousse result in a creamy mouthfeel. It?s all a bit obvious and simple, but undeniably good."
France,93.0,56.0,Champagne,Charlier & Fils,"This is one of a collection of Champagnes tasted and approved by a group of growers under the Special Club label. With a predominance of Chardonnay, it's still crisp and fruity, showing rich apple and pear flavors. Its citrusy acidity gives it lift, slowing any signs of maturity. It will continue to age gracefully but is delicious now."
US,87.0,25.0,Arroyo Seco,Martin Ranch,"The nose on this wine mixes up apricots, peaches and lime granita with a charred dill element. The palate shows almonds, Meyer lemon and freshly-cut nectarine, altogether refreshing if not wildly memorable."
US,90.0,75.0,St. Helena,Roberts & Rogers,"Reduced on the nose, this massively intense and tannic wine is big, dense and juicy, broadly etched in leather, blackberry, currant and black licorice. Full-bodied and oaky, it shows the concentration of the vintage and the ripeness of the appellation and style."
France,88.0,15.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau des Demoiselles,"Solid tannins and rich fruit come together in this ripe, still-young wine. It has good potential, with bold black fruit and a dense, mineral texture. It will need several years for those tannins to soften. Drink from 2021."
US,90.0,35.0,Eola-Amity Hills,BKB,"The debut release for this producer is a bright garnet shade. Exhuberant and broad, the palate is bursting with cranberry, blue plum and Bing cherry flavors. Drink over the next year or two, while it is at its freshest."
US,92.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Flora Springs,"A long-time producer of great Chardonnay, Flora Springs hits a new level with this reserve commemorative bottling. The wine is spectacularly rich in tropical fruits, green apples and limes, with elaborate buttered toast and vanilla flavors from new oak, and a wonderfully creamy, leesy complexity."
France,90.0,30.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"This second wine from ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette is rich with ripe, generous fruits and tannins in the background. It has concentration, dusty texture and generous acidity. Expect this wine to be ready to drink in the next year."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Tassi,"You'll find aromas of forest floor, toast, porcini mushroom, game and a balsamic note on this vibrant red. The smooth, dense palate offers tart red cherry, truffle, anise and a salty hint of cured meat alongside bright acidity and fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Ridolfi,"Spicy wood notes, dark fruit, rum cake, dried ginger, licorice and cola add up to an ethereal and elegant Brunello that is more smooth and silky than it is bold and bulky. Spice, sandalwood and cedar appear on the close, but it has a compact, streamlined structure."
US,89.0,38.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cougar Crest,"This wine is five years old and is starting to show its age. Aromas of dried tobacco, tomato leaf, mesquite and vanilla are followed by velvety-feeling fruit flavors that show a pleasing persistence. Drink now."
US,93.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,Kevin White,"This wine is 100% Syrah from Boushey, Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards. Alluring aromas of herb, blackberry, bramble, green olive, flower and smoked meat lead to a richly flavored palate that explodes with abundant savory, meaty flavors. It drinks like a charcuterie plate, with plenty of fresh herbs rounding it out."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Jenica Peak,"A bit raw and rustic, with stalky flavors of black cherries, sage and black pepper. Okay with everyday fare."
US,84.0,20.0,Napa County,Punk Dog,"Soft and melted in texture, with flavors of cherry jam, cassis, chocolate mints, anise and pepper. Simple, but tasty."
Argentina,84.0,4.0,Mendoza,Broke Ass,"Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum. Bland on the finish, but for $4 who's caring about finish?"
US,85.0,25.0,Texas,Brennan,"Succinct and to-the-point, this Viognier is bight in pineapple, citron and peach on the nose and palate. There's a decent weight and texture, however the flavors don't carry too long. Drink now."
US,90.0,75.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Two Sisters,"Baked cherry and cranberry fruit kick off the nose of this bottling, followed by then wild thyme and touches of dust and smoke. The palate is light and zesty, with hibiscus and tea flavors along with cranberry fruit and more fresh herbs on the finish."
Italy,87.0,35.0,Valtellina,Nino Negri,"This blend of Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Incrocio Manzoni and Chiavennasca (another name for Nebbiolo, but in this case the red variety is vinified as a white wine) originates in Sondrio, in the far north of Italy. The nose is indeed slightly muddled but the wine does deliver cool climate tones of white peach and fragrant flower."
France,88.0,95.0,Pommard,Louis Latour,"With its tannins, the wine is firm, tight and dark. The black fruit flavors are just beginning to come through. It has power and structure and certainly needs to age. Drink from 2017."
US,91.0,60.0,Napa Valley,William Hill Estate,"Rich and ripe, this has a plushness of red currant and cassis counterbalanced by blackberry on the underbelly. A well-hewn texture leans leathery, with seasonings of black pepper giving it a piquant and lengthy finish."
Italy,86.0,28.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Tenute Silvio Nardi,"Aromas include raisin, underbrush, tobacco leaf, vanilla and espresso. The palate delivers blueberry extract, mocha and subtle oak alongside soft acidity and fleeting tannins. It's forward and extremely accessible so enjoy throughout 2015."
US,86.0,30.0,Carneros,Gregory Graham,"Deep gold in color, this vineyard designate is oaky, with gingerbread, caramel and canned pineapple flavors. It's full, unctuous and creamy on the palate."
US,90.0,25.0,Napa County-Sonoma County,Twomey,"With the majority of the fruit from the producer's Calistoga and Oakville estate vineyards, as well as its Healdsburg property, this is a dry, citrus-laden wine, zesty and refreshing in lime and grapefruit. The acidity is dialed high, yet remains balanced by the density of fruit and body, the overall effect just right in terms of ripeness."
France,86.0,28.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Larrivaux,"This wine is dry and likely to remain so. That's because the black currant flavors are too light for the structure, resulting in high acidity, firm tannins and a hole in the middle."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Barolo,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista,"Wild berry, new leather, iris, dark spice and crushed herb aromas carry over to the elegant palate along with juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry, clove and white pepper. Firm fine-grained tannins and bright acidity lend balance and structure. Drink 2023??035."
Argentina,92.0,112.0,La Consulta,Achaval-Ferrer,"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009??012."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Valtellina Superiore,BarbÃ can,"Dark berry, resin, brown baking spice and menthol aromas lead the way. The firm tightly knit palate offers black cherry, licorice, sage and espresso alongside assertive grainy tannins and nervous acidity. Drink 2018??023."
US,88.0,19.0,Horse Heaven Hills,San Juan Vineyards,"All of the fruit for this wine hails from Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Though it saw no new oak, the barrel aromas of vanilla and woodspice seem to jut out. The cranberry and raspberry flavors bring appeal however backed by grainy tannins."
US,90.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,St. Francis,"Not much Cabernet Sauvignon remains in the Russian River Valley, making this wine an outlier worth seeking. Cinnamon and nutmeg dust the entry, followed by a persistent level of baking spice on the palate. Approachable blue fruit and licorice dominate midway, revealing the 5% Malbec that's been blended in."
France,89.0,25.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Georges Duboeuf,Intense fruit and acidity give this wine a brightly refreshing character. It's about lemon and lime flavors with slices of red apple to bring out more sweetness. The aftertaste has a mineral edge that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2017.
US,90.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Saggi,"Saggi is the super Tuscan entry in the Long Shadows portfolio, made by Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. Here it is a blend of 45% Sangiovese, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah ?not much different from 2007. Smoky in the nose, broadly fruity in the mouth, with an attractive mix of black cherry fruit and bacon fat highlights. It fades a bit in the finish, and there is just the faintest hint of onion."
US,87.0,32.0,Alexander Valley,Dashe Cellars,"Robust and spicy, with a soft, juicy mouthfeel framing Zinny flavors of wild cherries, mulberries and briary blackberries. It's pretty tannic, and calls for rich, greasy barbecue."
France,86.0,15.0,Alsace,Domaine Robert Klingenfus,"Very easy, slightly confected cherry fruit comes immediately to the fore. The palate has the same candy-ish notion countered with lots of freshness. The body is light, translucent and off dry. Drink soon while berryish aromas are at their peak."
Italy,91.0,45.0,Sicilia,Principi di Spadafora,"Well-executed and very intense, this dense Sicilian Cabernet imparts a few green notes of dried herbs, bell pepper and coffee bean. Here, the rosemary and wild sage nuances are very attractive and the wine sits confidently in the mouth thanks to its firm tannins and solid structure."
US,91.0,33.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sightglass,"An equal split between these two varieties with the fruit coming from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this wine brings vibrant aromas of bramble, raspberry and light barrel tones. The fruit is fresh and lively with a real snap to it, accented by creamy oak flavors."
Argentina,88.0,10.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Lagarde,"With a nice opening of plum, black cherry, floral notes and mocha, this captures the essence of quality Mendoza Malbec. The palate is generous and round, if a bit warm, and the flavors of blackberry, prune, spice and coffee are what we want from this type of wine. Drink throughout the winter and into 2010."
France,88.0,32.0,Champagne,Piper-Heidsieck,"This is an elegant, lean wine, with earthy and smoky notes that just barely veer into melon. It?s dry and well structured, and has a nice balance of acids, sugar and alcohol. The finish is rich and toasty."
US,88.0,23.0,Elkton Oregon,Monte Ferro,"Sourced from old-vine WÃ¤denswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density."
US,92.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Wolf Family,"A lovely Cab, polished and refined, and a huge improvement over the winery's 2004 bottling. Shows classic Napa Valley softness and roundness, a wine that seduces the palate. There are complex flavors of black currants, sweet sage and cedar, wrapped into silky, ripe tannins. Delicious now, and should develop for a decade or more."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Bolgheri,Michele Satta,"This blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 10% Syrah and 10% Teroldego opens with violet, cinnamon and Mediterranean herb aromas. The soft, succulent palate delivers raspberry, red cherry and cinnamon flavors, with supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy through 2018."
US,86.0,16.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"While a bit demure in character, this full-bodied, dry Pinot Gris boasts fresh apple, pear and lemon notes. Crisp citrus acidity shines on the finish. Drink now."
France,86.0,10.0,Ventoux,Ravoire et Fils,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, this medium- to full-bodied red features bright aromas of cherry, herb, chocolate and espresso, but turns dry and dusty-textured on the finish. Drink now."
US,88.0,18.0,North Coast,Horse & Plow,"Horse & Plow continues to impress with its moderately priced wines that taste great. Harvester is a blend of 38% Pinot Gris, 34% Riesling and 28% Chardonnay that's austere aromatically and deep golden in color, woody and tasting of tart green apple, unearthed mushrooms with a lemony finish."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Peter Zemmer,"Cortinie Bianco opens with impressive intensity and lasting aromas of peach cobbler, vanilla cream and preserved peaches. It follows with a smooth, dense texture in the mouth."
France,87.0,40.0,Chablis,Domaine Charly Nicolle,"Light and fruity, this has flavors of creamed apple and ripe Williams pear. The wine is crisp and tangy, and it's shot through with lemon zest and acidity. Ready to drink in one year."
US,95.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reynvaan Family Vineyards,"A wine glass can hardly contain this lightly colored wine's generous aromas of black olive, sea salt, crushed flowers, orange peel, black pepper, mineral and smoked meat. The smoke and savory flavors display a fascinating mixture of lightness and intensity, leading to a floral finish that seems near endless."
Italy,89.0,22.0,Barbera d'Alba Superiore,Castello di Neive,"This full-bodied Barbera opens with aromas of mature plum, violet, vanilla, toasted oak, sage and coffee. The firm palate offers black currant, raspberry, clove and anise accompanied by vibrant acidity and fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Coste della Sesia,Travaglini,"Polished and fragrant, this charming red offers alluring scents of freshly picked rose, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity and supple tannins balance the bright cherry, strawberry, white pepper and anise flavors. Enjoy through 2017."
Spain,89.0,17.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Val do Sosego,"With proper doses of orange rind, vanilla, minerality and melon on the nose, this opens in very good form. The palate is round, pithy and citric in feel, while flavors of white grapefruit, orange and melon finish with a mild oily mouthfeel and a touch of bitterness."
US,84.0,14.0,Central Coast,Cupcake,"Another clean, brisk and slightly sweet Chardonnay from Cupcake, at a pretty good price. Its shows orange, peach, vanilla, buttered toast and white sugar flavors."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Santi,"Aromas of ripe black plum, underbrush and exotic spice come together on this brawny red. The firm palate offers black cherry extract, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside chewy tannins."
France,88.0,36.0,Chablis,Pascal Bouchard,"Crisp, green and steely, this is classic Chablis, all about pure green fruits and minerality, only lightly layered with wood. It is vibrant and fresh, with the acidity adding a mouthwatering lightness."
Italy,85.0,26.0,Trento,Gaierhof,"Aromas of yellow apple, toast and walnut lead the nose and carry over to the simple palate along with notes of dried bread crumbs. Vigorous bubbles provide a somewhat abrasive texture."
France,90.0,24.0,MÃ¢con-Uchizy,Pierre Merguey,"Crisp and tangy, this is a tightly knit wine. Apples and crisp citrus flavors are part of a package that also includes spice, a strong minerality and a perfumed aftertaste. The wine should age a few more months, so drink from 2017. This is a ?village??wine in the northern MaÃ§on area."
US,91.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Elk Cove,"Bone dry, this succulent, citrus-soaked Riesling is a textural marvel. Mixing grapefruit, lime and pear fruit flavors, its racy acidity underscores its complexity."
US,88.0,26.0,Wahluke Slope,Milbrandt,"The oak??0% new French and American?gets far out front with its notes of coffee, toffee and vanilla. But there's still much to enjoy, with abundant red fruit and a soft, sultry feel."
US,93.0,40.0,Guenoc Valley,Langtry,"This wine has dark fruit and spicy oak flavors, plenty of concentration and a full body. It maintains a sleek, balanced feel despite the potent tannins of this grape variety. The finish is flavorful and long-lasting. Drink a bottle or two now and cellar several more until at least 2020."
US,85.0,23.0,Sonoma County,Sivas-Sonoma,"Blended with 12% Petite Sirah, this is a hearty, ripe and stewy wine, baked in plum and blackberry. A puckering girth of tannin unwraps itself in the glass as it goes. Cinnamon and black pepper play on the finish, along with a hint of dried herb."
Australia,90.0,27.0,Langhorne Creek,Bleasdale,"There's plenty of vanillin and cedary oak in this wine, but it's easily balanced by impressive levels of cassis and blackberry fruit. The texture in the mouth is creamy and supple, and the finish is long and vanilla-laden but silky, without any harsh wood tannins. The blend is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot."
US,88.0,30.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Latah Creek,"Brooding aromas of dill, purple fruit, vanilla and wood spice are followed by full dark cherry flavors backed by a wall of firm yet still accessible tannins."
US,88.0,53.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"This blend is 74% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot. Locked up vanilla, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to high-octane dark-fruit flavors, with the heat providing some distraction."
Italy,88.0,28.0,Barbera d'Alba,Pecchenino,"The longer this wine sits in the glass, the more beautiful its aromas become. It opens with a dark and rich appearance and vibrant notes of blueberry, wild berry and exotic spice. There's a slightly lactic note at first that slowly evolves into milk chocolate and fudge."
France,91.0,36.0,Sancerre,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin,"This is a structured wine with layers of tannins as well as ripe red plum skin fruit flavors. It is a wine for aging, which would bring out a rich texture as well as intense acidity. It should not be drunk before 2017."
Argentina,85.0,14.0,Patagonia,Alpataco,"Smells largely neutral, with slightly earthy red fruit aromas. The palate is soft and creamy, what I'd call low in acidity, with mellow, mildly baked flavors of black cherry and chocolate powder. Finishes full and plump, but calls out to be drunk right away."
Spain,91.0,50.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020."
Italy,86.0,29.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Poggio Alloro,"Subdued aromas of French oak, toast and acacia waft out of the glass. The rather lean palate offers oak-driven spice, chopped herb and a hint of citrus set against racy acidity. It's rather shy on fruit richness."
US,90.0,45.0,Ballard Canyon,Rusack,"From century-old grapevines found on Santa Cruz Island, this bottling offers concentrated raspberry and a touch of strawberry, lifted by eucalyptus and lavender notes. The palate is enlivening, with tight cranberry fruit, elderflower and pencil-lead flavors."
US,96.0,38.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"This tops a thoroughly outstanding lineup of eight estate-grown Rieslings from Trisaetum. Unctuous citrus and stone fruits abound: a luscious mix of Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit, peach and apricot. There are hints of honey, caramel and butter, and everything is tightened up by defining acidity. Though entirely ageworthy, this is so thoroughly delicious already you'll want to drink at least a bottle or two immediately. Drink now through 2035."
France,94.0,87.0,Champagne,Bruno Paillard,"Paillard's crispest Chardonnay comes mainly from the CÃ´te des Blancs. Offering great white fruit and bright apple flavors, this wine is also textured and mineral. It is beginning to mature, suggesting a touch of toastiness while the fruit remains. It finishes dry. Drink the wine now."
Australia,87.0,188.0,Barossa Valley,Torbreck,"This aged for 18 months in new French barriques, and the influence of that is marked. Cedary, gently sawdusty notes and a touch of nail polish are apparent on the nose, while the palate is admirably full bodied and richly textured. The finish is generally velvety, but also shows hints of varnish or paint thinner. Overall, the raw materials are impressive, but the wine comes across as a bit disjointed."
Spain,85.0,10.0,Rueda,Nebla,"Clear and lucid to the eye, this Verdejo shows pine, grapefruit, orange and apple aromas along with oily pith. The mouthfeel is more plump and wet than defined, while lychee and melon flavors are offset by tolerable bitter pyrazines and grapefruit flavors."
France,87.0,26.0,Sancerre,FranÃ§ois Millet,"The grapes were harvested in the early morning to preserve the real freshness that is here. The attractive, rich wine is full in the mouth with its red-berry and red-currant fruits that are cut with citrus. The wine is ready to drink."
Italy,87.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Rivetti Massimo,"This wine's menthol, new leather, toast, eucalyptus and exotic spice aromas lift from the glass. The firm palate shows dried cherry, pomegranate, chopped sage and roasted coffee bean flavors while grainy tannins lend a raspy finish."
France,93.0,36.0,Alsace,Paul Blanck,"A lovely lemony lift jumps from the glass and immediately signals maturing Riesling. The palate is still taut with freshness but has the harmonious balminess of bottle age. Hints of dried pear and candied lemon peel appear. The palate is as precise and taut as ever, brightened by utter apple and citrus crispness. The finish is long, dry and utterly clean cut."
US,97.0,50.0,Oak Knoll District,Trefethen,"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012??018, at least."
US,90.0,24.0,Yakima Valley,Owen Roe,"The first release of this wine to carry a Yakima Valley designation, this blend of Grenache, Syrah, MourvÃ¨dre and Cinsault leaps up with aromas of fresh raspberries, plum, garrigue and pepper along with light barrel accents. The elegant flavors show a striking sense of freshness and purity that keep you coming back for more."
France,88.0,65.0,Volnay,Alex Gambal,"Soft fruit, with a tannic hint underneath. The wine is supported at this stage by wood, while the fruit has strawberry jam sweetness. The acidity and structure really only come through at the end."
US,89.0,20.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Seven Hills,"This wine is partially barrel fermented and blended with a small amount of SÃ©millon. Herb, citrus and passion fruit aromas are followed by flavorful yet sleek tropical fruit notes that linger on the finish. It brings a whole lot of appeal."
US,86.0,26.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mounts,"Nutty with baked peach and pineapple notes, this wine is medium-bodied but surprisingly restrained on the palate, nearly unresolved. It grows more citrusy in the glass, with a spark of lemon zest on the finish."
France,91.0,20.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Landat,"There is a fine mineral texture to this structured, firm wine from the northern Haut-MÃ©doc. It also has ripe fruit and a richly tannic character, with flavors of black plum juice and berry. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, this will age over several years."
France,89.0,22.0,CÃ´tes du Roussillon Villages,Hecht & Bannier,"Modern and pleasing, this wine exhibits strong, sweet oak notes of vanilla and cream that infuse the rich red cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. Creamy in the mouth with good balance and a medium-length finish. Drink now."
US,83.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Canoe Ridge,Muscat gummy and herb aromas are followed by dry tropical fruit and ale flavors that are lightly styled. Drink now.
France,93.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine de la Tour Blanche,"Wonderfully lively notes of fresh aromatic orange and citrus zest mingle together. The palate is bright and tight, fresh and concentrated. The body is slender and energetic, precise and fresh and has a lovely translucent quality with a beautifully clean finish. Drink now through 2025."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Ribera del Duero,SeÃ±orÃ­o de Sotillo,"Bouncy, rubbery berry aromas come with latex and Band-Aid scents. A wiry, crisp mouthfeel sets up limited but spunky red-fruit flavors that are also a bit herbal and stalky. A briny finish shows juicy acidity but mediocre flavors."
US,91.0,38.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tulpen,"Tulpen's 2009 Cabernet moves the fruit sources to a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, notably Tokar and Heather Hill, to good effect. It's pure varietal, and the excellent fruit sources yield a muscular, aromatic, dense wine. Floral top notes lead into spicy, brambly black fruits. The tannins are firm and astringent, leaving just a bare suggestion of ripe raisins in the finish."
US,91.0,36.0,Napa Valley,Keenan,"Merlot hardly gets richer than this. Just explodes in the mouth with flavors of black cherry, blackberry and chocolate truffle flavors. As sweet as it seems, it's actually dry, with a wonderful edge of acidity. Drink now."
US,86.0,35.0,Carneros,Frank Family,"This wine is highly ripe and voluptuous, with a distinct boldness of tropical flavor and almond paste. Full figured, it's embraced by a generosity of oak that makes itself known."
US,89.0,28.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Magna Mater,"The expected cut-grass greenness shows on the nose of this wine, but so do plenty of white flowers, nectarine, golden apples and chalk. The palate is rather rich in style for this grape, perhaps explained by its slight aging, but well done with ripe apple flesh and more cut-grass flavors."
US,88.0,48.0,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Lone Madrone,"With 58% MourvÃ¨dre, 20% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 2% Counoise grapes from the dry-farmed, head-pruned Old Oak Vineyard (formerly Sheep Camp Creek), this wine shows dried black cherries, pencil lead, uncrushed cloves and nutmeg on the nose. The palate is flatter, with cooked cherries as well as other dried purple and red fruits."
US,92.0,25.0,California,Les Belles Collines,"Crisp, clean flavors of apple and apricot shine in this medium-bodied, lively and dry white, an ideal companion at the table. A sly finish of lemon peel adds to its refreshment, and it's best enjoyed now."
Italy,94.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Livio Sassetti,"Floral and refined, this opens with alluring scents of violet, iris, perfumed berry, earth and a whiff of pressed powder. The savory, elegant palate offers up juicy wild cherry, raspberry, truffle, anise and white pepper framed in a network of silky tannins. It's already extremely accessible and will offer fine drinking pleasure for the near and mid-term."
US,82.0,16.0,Monterey County,Estancia,"Nice and silky in the mouth, but raw in green acids, with a tart, almost sour taste to the cherries and mint. Drink now."
US,94.0,75.0,Alexander Valley,Blue Rock,"Shows the softness and herbal quality that mark Alexander Valley Cabernet, in the best sense. The wine feels fine and beautiful in the mouth, with the complexity and elegance to pair with great food. Delightful for its cherry, berry, currant, cola and oak flavors. Great now, and should develop over the next five years."
Italy,88.0,27.0,Bolgheri,Argentiera,"This Bordeaux-style red blend from Bolgheri offers delicate blackberry, espresso and exotic spice aromas. The palate is charged with blackberry, graphite and licorice, its pliant tannins carrying those flavors into the finish. Drink through 2019."
US,88.0,50.0,Rutherford,Round Pond,"Extremely rich, soft and fruity, like blackberry pie drizzled with melted chocolate. The tannins are lush, complex and gentle. Made in the modern way, it's certainly delicious, but almost too much of a good thing."
US,83.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Cerro Prieto,"Sharp and jammy, like Lifesaver cherry and blackberry sour candy. Finishes sweet in fruity extract."
France,89.0,18.0,Bordeaux CÃ´tes de Francs ,ChÃ¢teau Franc-Cardinal,"Dark colored wine, with ripe black plum flavors that lie over solidly textured tannins. Structured to bring out the fruit, the wine also has a core of wood, spice, dark cocoa and black currant acidity to finish. An attractive wine that is worth aging for another two years."
France,84.0,11.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau Lamothe-Vincent,"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character."
US,86.0,30.0,"The Hamptons, Long Island",WÃ¶lffer,"A bit voluptuous in style, this bold, round Chardonnay accents fresh apple and pear with slick tones of buttered popcorn and toast. It's rich and silky in mouthfeel with a lingering kiss of warmth on the finish."
Spain,84.0,15.0,Rioja,El Circulo,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range. The palate is largely fresh and balanced, with peppery red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A woody encore smothers the finish."
Argentina,91.0,25.0,Mendoza,Belasco de Baquedano,"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Toscana,Tenuta Sette Ponti,"Hail the first vintage of this international-style blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from a new quality-minded producer near Arezzo. It's deep with saturated blackberry and hints of dried citrus rind and smoked meat. The round, full-bodied, ripe-fruit palate is sure to please fans of big, modern wines."
Italy,93.0,120.0,Venezia Giulia,Gravner,"There's no other wine like this in the world, and it won't appeal to everyone. Anfora is matured in ceramic amphorae for seven months in a throwback to ancient winemaking techniques to achieve a deep golden color and penetrating aromas of resin, caramel, chestnut honey and cola. The firmstructure could match that of a mature red and the wine imparts resinous, almost syrupy density."
Italy,88.0,37.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Tenute del Cerro,"Aromas of vanilla, toast, mocha and plum come together in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, toasted oak and oak-driven spices but the fruit flavors are already drying up."
US,90.0,75.0,Red Mountain,Col Solare,"The aromas bring notes of plum, blue fruit and barrel spice. The palate comes off as considerably darker, with rich fruit flavors supported by firm tannins. There are lots of good things going on if the aromas and flavors sync up, though it doesn't seem much like Cabernet."
US,88.0,26.0,Edna Valley,Tolosa,"How about a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese with this dry, tart Chardonnay? The keen acidity will cut through the richness, while the suggestion of sweet, toasted oak will play well with the meat's umami smokiness."
France,93.0,37.0,Sancerre,Domaine Roger & Christophe Moreux,"From one of the most famous vineyard slopes in Sancerre, the wine is tight, structured and still young. It has great potential with rich citrus, herbs and green fruit flavors. Along with the tense, mineral texture, the wine has both concentration and aging ability. Drink from 2019."
US,92.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Coho,"Impressively flashy, an opulent wine that immediately offers a blast of blackberries, cherries, currants, red licorice and cedar. But it's quite astringent in tannins. Age this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend for 5?? years."
US,87.0,26.0,Sonoma County,Sanglier Cellars,"Creamy vanilla and pear pie provide a fleshy and full-bodied texture to this wine, which leans tropical in guava and melon. Aged in entirely neutral oak, the fruit shows well within a wave of ripeness."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Romagna,Tre Monti,"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, baking spice and mocha lead the nose while the ripe palate offers black plum, vanilla and tobacco. Assertive tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. Drink through 2019."
US,92.0,40.0,Santa Maria Valley,Riverbench,"This is one of the best Pinots Riverbench has produced. It's a delight to drink, with a silky, gentle texture and crisp acidity to get your mouth watering. For all the lightness of mouthfeel, the flavors are serious, suggesting raspberries and cherries with earthy notes of mushrooms, cola and herb tea. It would not be surprising if this wine was still gaining traction in 2020, but you can decant it and drink it now."
Australia,89.0,95.0,Heathcote,Heathcote Estate,"Like Spinal Tap, this wine turns the volume up to 11, packing in enough blueberry jam for breakfast on the Queen Mary II and enough cedary oak to build 100 saunas. It's undeniably powerful and intense, and embued with a lush, creamy texture; the only question is how it will evolve. Drink it now and stand your hair on end."
US,94.0,175.0,Napa Valley,Terlato,"Terlato has mastered the art of crafting Bordeaux-style red wines that scream Napa Valley. The style is the modern one of exceptional ripeness, softness and sweetness, generously oaked and slightly high in alcohol. Here, you'll find deep flavors of blackberries, mocha, black currants, olives and toast. It's ready to drink now, and should develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years."
Australia,86.0,21.0,Orange,Logan Australia,"Focused in the mouth with just a touch of creaminess, the Logan offers pear and nutmeg flavors, and a hint of green apple on the finish. It's not a mouthfilling, overly flashy wine, but this could be a good thing if you're pouring it with dinner. Try it with your first-course seafood dish."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Umani Ronchi,"This easygoing, informal wine offers subdued aromas suggesting cassis, raisin and a note of dried herb. The simple palate shows mature plum and a hint of clove alongside fleeting tannins."
US,87.0,13.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Mercer,"Aromas of peach, nectarine and pear lead to dry, fleshy stone-fruit flavors that decline toward the finish."
US,93.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Opaque,"There is a great amount of dark strawberry freshness on the nose of this intriguing and seductive bottling, enhanced by gravel, pepper and a distinctive mintiness. Peppercorns, beef char and smoke hit the palate alongside blueberry and boysenberry, with plum-skin tartness and firm tannins ensuring ageability."
Spain,86.0,12.0,Rioja,Bodegas Franco-EspaÃ±olas,"This semisweet blend of Malvasia and Viura is not everyday stuff, but if you have a taste for something sweet and different, give it a try. The nose is floral and waxy, while flavors of honey and ultraripe pineapple are heady and sugary. Not a drop-dead winner but unique and interesting."
US,91.0,35.0,Sonoma Valley,La Chertosa,"Sonoma Valley stalwart Sam Sebastiani returns to the winemaking fold with this small-production Sangiovese. A juicy study in robust, powerful tannins and fresh plum, it has a trace of anise on the back of the palate. Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and 4% Malbec, it spent a year in older French oak barrels and is a delicious California version of the Italian classic."
Spain,86.0,11.0,Utiel-Requena,MarquÃ©s de ChivÃ©,"Minty cherry aromas and a distant mineral note akin to crushed seashells set up an honest, slightly rubbery palate with medicinal cherry flavors that come with a touch of bitterness. A juicy, steady finish is fresh but straightforward."
US,89.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Summerland,"Baked black plums, nutmeg, gingerbread spice, cinnamon and concentrated hibiscus show on the nose of this impressive countywide blend. The palate centers on forest floor elements of juniper and eucalyptus as well as tart cranberry fruit and a touch of smoke. Would wash down a variety of foods well."
US,90.0,25.0,Lodi,Klinker Brick,"This wine has all the deep, dark color and firm tannins that are expected, but it pleasantly sweetens the blackberry flavors ever so slightly and smooths the edges in terms of texture, for a big wine that's also quite friendly."
France,92.0,60.0,Crozes-Hermitage,Paul Jaboulet AÃ®nÃ©,"Despite this wine's thick veneer of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, it has plenty of underlying fruit, powerful enough to handle the wood. It's full bodied, dense and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish redolent of blackberries and cedar. Approachable now, but should easily age through 2025."
US,86.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Zero One Vintners,"The 2010 Sauce is three quarters Merlot, with Syrah and Malbec filling in the rest. It's a simple, accessible red blend, with accents of cut tobacco over black cherry fruit."
Argentina,85.0,25.0,Mendoza,Mendel,"Initial weedy, herbaceous aromas give way to more waxy stone-fruit scents. In the mouth, this is razor sharp and sky high in acidity. Pithy, sharp flavors of green apple, lemon and underripe peach finish tangy, much like white pineapple."
Argentina,90.0,24.0,Mendoza,Kaiken,"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors. Shows touches of mint and spice on the finish along with coffee, licorice and chocolate. Drink now through 2012."
US,91.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Gustafson Family,"Tobacco and tar stand out in this densely packed, robustly built estate, 100% varietal wine. Full bodied, it's a study in dark chocolate and smoked meats, wrapped in oak and black pepper. There's some serious power to this wine."
US,85.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Steelhead Vineyards,"There are lots of rich, ripe vanilla, buttered toast and tropical fruit flavors in this creamy wine. Brightened with acidity, it will appeal to plenty of Chardonnay fans."
Italy,89.0,88.0,Barolo,Bric Cenciurio,"Aromas of baked plum, mocha, toast and sweet pipe tobacco drive the nose while the palate offers palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, vanilla, nutmeg and leather. A note of dried sage closes the finish while austere tannins provide bracing support. Drink 2019??029."
US,87.0,34.0,Yountville,Tamber Bey,"Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this wine is dominated by tropical fruit, swimming in pineapple and banana aromas and flavors. Unfettered by oak, it boasts sizzling acidity and, while tasty, is somewhat one-dimensional."
Italy,86.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Luiz Barichello,"This opens with delicate scents of red berry and fragrant blue flower. The soft, easygoing palate offers juicy wild cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside fresh acidity and round tannins. It's simple but well made."
France,87.0,20.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Les Hauts de Palette,"Big tannins dominate this still young wine. It has spice and a dry toast character that will need to soften. With acidity and hints of red fruits that should happen, so drink this wine from 2019 when its potential should be realized."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Alto Adige Valle Isarco,Cantina Valle Isarco,"Subdued aromas of Alpine wild flowers, earth and mineral come with a whiff of hay. The reserved palate offers green apples, pineapple and mineral notes. It has nice weight and a smooth texture."
US,92.0,30.0,Sonoma Coast,La Follette,"Just gorgeous, a wine to linger over with the finest food. Bone dry and crisp in acidity, it shows subtle flavors of sour cherry candy, persimmons and spices. Sweet, smoky oak is perfectly integrated. One of the best Pinot Noirs of the vintage in this price range and a comparative bargain."
France,86.0,10.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine de Mirail,"From vines in the northeast corner of the Gers, this wine is fruity, fragrant and crisply perfumed. It is light on the palate, dancing with fresh acidity and a lightly herbal character. Drink now."
US,94.0,59.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"Riddle is in Green Valley, on a high ridge prone to morning fog. This resulting effort showcases a sizzling, mouthwatering basket of wild strawberry, cherry and vanilla tea, managing to be plush, lush and elegant simultaneously. Juicy and pleasurable, it's immediately enjoyable, silky and the right kind of rich."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Toscana,Jacopo Biondi-Santi,"Here's a fun and extremely floral Sauvignon Blanc from Tuscany with a lean, compact feel in the mouth and lingering tones of citrus, stone fruit and grapefruit. It's a crisp and tonic white wine that would serve well at outdoor parties or during cocktail hour."
US,84.0,20.0,New Mexico,VivÃ¡c Winery,"An alluring nose of plum, leather and spice leads on this red, and on the palate, structured, big fruit flavors follow. It's jammy but has grip, and though slightly one dimensional, the wine has character. A good showing."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Chianti Classico,Le Miccine,"Very ripe, with earthy aromas of black plum, berry liqueur and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is meaty and muscular, but not hard. A wall of moderate tannins builds after a few sips, but the overall feel is still soft. The finish is medium in length, with adequate depth."
US,95.0,100.0,Dundee Hills,Archery Summit,"Complex, classy winemaking is evident from the first sniff to the final sip. Savory notes of green tea and clean earth complement a terroir-driven wine. The notes and nuances pile on?flowers and fruits, cherry and cassis, with a whiff of barnyard and undergrowth. The lingering, expressive finish is already boggling, and seems sure to continue to evolve gracefully through 2025??030."
Spain,84.0,9.0,Spain,Silvae,"Herbal, earthy aromas tell the story. The wine has heft and stemmy qualities, with sweet berry and coffee flavors along with mounting warmth. Turns more herbal and earthy as it airs out, with staunch acidity and a rubbery tannic grip."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Sicilia,Caruso & Minini,"This Inzolia offers clean and fresh aromas of citrus, peach, white flower and garden herb. A subtle touch of sweetness is found on the palate."
US,92.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, CarmÃ©nÃ¨re, Malbec and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of purple fruit, green herb, clove, barrel spice and spice box. It's light and supple, filling out with palate-coating fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip that softens with additional time open. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
US,87.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Snoqualmie,"Juicy cranberry and pie cherry fruit brings this wine into clear focus. There is an underpinning of wet cement that comes across in the mid-palate, a sort of a stone wall that the fruit can't quite overcome. It fades into an astringent, tannic finish, still buoyed by those juicy acids."
Italy,90.0,16.0,Alto Adige,Tiefenbrunner,"Appealing aromas of acacia flower, Alpine herb and citrus follow over to the refined palate along with yellow apple, Bartlett pear and lemon zest. Crisp acidity brightens the creamy flavors."
US,93.0,75.0,Chalk Hill,Chalk Hill,"Rich, round and ripe, this is made from a musquÃ© clone originally from Dijon, France, meant to impart memorable aromatics. It does, in spades, revealing wafts of honeysuckle and fresh pineapple amid a bright, tangy twist of acidity and gravely minerality, sharing a touch of salt on the finish."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Chianti Classico,Rocca delle MacÃ¬e,"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather."
Italy,86.0,115.0,Barolo,Renzo Seghesio,"Aromas of grilled herb, roasted hazelnut and cured meat follow through to the palate along with leather and a gamy note. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is already evolved and the fruit richness has started to dry up."
US,89.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,Kestrel,"This wine's aromas are bright and fruit forward, with generous black pepper, raspberry, fresh flower, smoked meat and barrel spice notes. The full-bodied palate delivers cranberry flavors that are appealing but more ponderous than the aromas might suggest."
France,92.0,105.0,Champagne,HurÃ© FrÃ¨res,"Pure Pinot Meunier from a select parcel of vines called La Grosse Pierre, this impressive limited-production bottling is an anomaly in Champagne. It fits HurÃ©'s crisp style yet also has rich fruitiness and generous acidity. Drink now."
US,86.0,24.0,Lodi,Jessie's Grove,"Velvety-smooth in texture, with well-articulated blackberry jam, cherry, cassis and melted dark chocolate flavors, this Zin is a little too dessert-like and Porty for my palate. But lots of people will love this richly superripe style."
France,93.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,"A tender but perfumed hint of honeysuckle appears first on the nose, followed by rich peach hints. These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness. You can feel the warmth on the medium-sweet finish. This is full on and rich, almost unctuous?perfect for blue cheeses."
Australia,85.0,5.0,South Eastern Australia,Banrock Station,"Banrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity. For $5, consumers get a decently textured, supple wine with plenty of forward blueberry and plum fruit and touches of chocolate and pepper. Look for it by the glass or buy it by the case for entertaining on a budget."
US,89.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Ziata,"This is a lush and likable white, a touch sweet in perception, with fully voluptuous body and texture. Peach and Good & Plenty black licorice play off the palate as a gravelly wet-stone note teases in the background."
US,87.0,24.0,Cayuga Lake,Treleaven,"Luscious peach and floral notes contrast dusty, earthy mineral tones in this unusually composed GewÃ¼rztraminer. The palate is mouthfilling and expansive, but peachy fresh flavors add levity. It's a bold, full bodied wine but surprisingly balanced through the finish. Drink now."
US,89.0,42.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tulpen,"This new cuvÃ©e features grapes from both Tokar and Yellowbird vineyards, located out in the Mill Creek region east of downtown Walla Walla. It's close enough to the Blue Mountains to allow for this experiment in dry-farmed (non-irrigated) grapes. Flavors are distinctive, showing wild berries, cola, grain and herb."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Galatina,Valle dell'Asso,"Ripe fruit tones and layers of spice (clove, cinnamon and black pepper) fold seamlessly together as one. The wine represents a hardy blend of Negroamaro and Montepulciano and offers the solid structure and firmness that you should expect from these two masculine indigenous grapes."
US,87.0,26.0,Sonoma County,Apsara,"Given time to settle in both used French oak and stainless steel, this is a nice effort from a well-respected vineyard that's big and juicy in grapefruit and melon. Made in a lighter style, it offers a bite of oak on the finish, leaving a substantial impression."
US,87.0,18.0,California,Clara,"Offering a thick mousse and a waft of hazelnut Frangelico, this is a clear, crisp and smooth sparkling Brut, delicious in golden delicious apple that finishes clean and swift."
US,85.0,14.0,Napa Valley,C&T;,"Partially barrel-fermented, partly stainless steel, this is a fresh, crisp and easy white. With ripe citrus, fig, spear-mint, honey and spice flavors, it's nice as an apÃ¨ritif, but will stand up to Thai or Vietnamese fare."
US,92.0,50.0,Napa Valley,White Oak,"Very deeply flavored, with fine, ripe blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, anchored with an earthy minerality. The finish is thoroughly dry. Yet it's also a very tannic wine, with a bracing, but fierce, mouthfeel that suggests time in the cellar. Better after 2013."
Italy,94.0,54.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Contucci,"This full-bodied blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo Nero and 10% Colorino opens with aromas of plum, ripe berry, smoke, leather and a hint of baking spice. The smooth, savory palate delivers layers of dark cherry, black raspberry, clove and cinnamon alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2015??021."
US,91.0,26.0,Rogue Valley,Jaxon,"Mistral is 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, aged two years in 20% new French oak. A pleasing hint of funk envelops the ripe purple berry and cassis fruit. Savory herb and pepper highlights come into play, and the long, smooth finish shows clean earth and a pat of butter."
France,84.0,12.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Marc Dupas,"This negociant has produced a simple fruity Muscadet with a zesty texture and easy acidity. Crisp and packed with citrus fruit, it is ready to drink."
US,93.0,55.0,Alexander Valley,Aperture,"Aromatically blessed in flecked coconut, this soft, round red blend is ripe and lush in black cherry and blueberry, with touches of cedar and tobacco in the background. Completely satisfying on the palate, remaining rich from start to end, it finishes structured and elegant, with delectable waves of dark chocolate and mocha. The blend is half Cabernet Sauvignon and half Malbec."
US,85.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Ca' Momi,"Soft, fruity and tannic, this has jammy blackberry, blueberry and currant flavors. It's ripe and tasty, but rustic, with some less-than-ripe mint flavors and edgy tannins."
US,87.0,11.0,California,Grayson,"An attractive oaky theme runs through this medium-bodied and appropriately tannic wine. It smells like toasted bread, cinnamon and vanilla, and tastes both fruity and full of oak spices."
US,91.0,55.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Big Basin,"Quite dark in the glass, this wine, which is made with 6% Viognier, shows the darkest of purple fruit scents on the nose, and needs quite a bit of time to start opening up, so tightly wound it is. The grippy, tangy and acid-driven texture is what compels the palate, where flavors of blackened blackberry, savory dried beef and char rise firm tannins deep into the finish."
US,88.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Illahe,"Fresh and pretty, this has a bright, refreshing palate that offers flavors of cranberry and raspberry. It's smooth and fruit forward, with medium aging potential."
US,93.0,19.0,Santa Barbara County,Alma Rosa,"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, kiwi and nectarine rise alongside greener elements of celery stalk, wet thyme and Granny Smith apple on this promising early look at the vintage. The tongue tingles throughout the sip, with flavors of crisp apple, yellow melon and crushed chalk. Buttercream appears on the finish."
US,93.0,60.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Efeste,"All varietal, this wine is mostly Klipsun and Bacchus vineyards, with Kiona and Red Willow rounding it out. The aromas bring immediate appeal, with pure notes of black cherry, fresh and dried savory herbs and crushed granite, showing pleasing complexities. The palate is tightly wound, showing a fine sense of depth that is balanced by bright acid and firm tannins. The finish lingers. It's a compelling example of the variety."
France,89.0,35.0,IrroulÃ©guy,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"From this small enclave in the foothills of the Basque Pyrenees, this blend of Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Petit Courbu is crisp, cool and perfumed. White stone fruits and a ripe tangy texture are cut with acidity and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
Spain,89.0,34.0,La Mancha,El Vinculo,"Big and burly, with highly respectable aromas of ripe blackberry, toast and mint. Attractive plum and blackberry flavors follow, and as it passes from palate to finish the wine shows its depth and structure. A little stiff in terms of oak and tannin and kind of simple overall. Still, it's a wine that indicates that La Mancha could finally be ready for the world stage."
France,87.0,15.0,Alsace,Helfrich,"A creamy, almost hazelnutty aroma hovers over juicy, fresh peach fruit. This wine is lively and fresh, with enough citrus verve to balance the fruit. It's simple but appetizing."
US,85.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Robert Hall,"This bottling shows the sweeter side of the Chardonnay, offering honeydew, lemon blossom and pear cider notes on the nose. The acidity is powerful upon first taste, yielding to peach, nectarine and ripe apple flavors, which come across as confected after a couple of sips."
France,85.0,18.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau du Moulin Rouge,"Fresh and fruity, this wine is full of black currants and acidity that is structured by a core of dark tannins. While it is firm at the moment it's likely to fill out, with the fresh fruitiness emerging. Drink from 2017."
Italy,87.0,50.0,Toscana,Guicciardini Strozzi,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of scorched soil, used leather and game. The aromas follow over to the funky palate along with mature plum and black pepper. It's already accessible, with evolved tannins. Enjoy soon."
US,86.0,8.0,California,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,"This is a wonderfully dry, crisp and super-drinkable white wine, perfect for a first cocktail of the afternoon. It's clean and brisk in acidity, with a flourish of lemon, lime and vanilla flavors. Spicy, too. Great with little puff pastry appetizers."
US,83.0,20.0,New Mexico,VivÃ¡c Winery,"A good balance of berry, spice and fruit recommend this; it has balance and structure and a degree of complexity that will lend it to pairing with heartier dishes. An interesting and fun wine."
US,88.0,25.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Koehler,"Light in color, this is a very aromatic take on the grape, with powerful jasmine, plumeria and guava aromas as well as just-sliced pear flesh. The palate is also ripe with tropical coconut and guava touches, cut with fresh and zesty acidity."
US,90.0,185.0,Napa Valley,Episode,"Dense and woody, this blends 58% Cabernet Sauvignon with 18% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Richly layered, it's tannic and robust in oak, allowing a delicate rendering of cassis and red currant to show quietly."
US,90.0,29.0,Ballard Canyon,Rusack,"Plump blueberries, slate, gravel, turned earth and a light fennel character show on this wine, which comes in a custom bottle exclusive to the appellation's estate-grown Syrahs. The palate shows a lively acidity that briskly expresses the black pepper, black currant and espresso flavors."
US,87.0,28.0,Knights Valley,Lawer,"This is rich and dry in blackberries, licorice, bacon, sweet oak and peppery spices. It shows lots of acidity and tannins, giving it a firm structure. Give it a brief decant and drink now."
US,89.0,42.0,Livermore Valley,Wood Family Vineyards,"The ripe cherry and strawberry flavors in this medium-bodied wine get great support from mild acidity and appetizing tannins. These create good balance and keep a little grip in the texture, helping the wine pair nicely with big proteins."
Argentina,88.0,29.0,Patagonia,Bodega Patritti,"Wiry aromas of red plum and cherry are offset by deeper, more baked and stewy notes. This drills away with hard tannins and punchy acidity, while cherry, plum, mint and earthy flavors finish with baked, chocolaty power. The blend is 40% each of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, with 20% Merlot."
Italy,89.0,16.0,Collio,Gradis'ciutta,"Aromas suggesting yellow spring flower, beeswax and yellow stone fruit set the tone while the ripe medium-bodied palate offers creamy golden apple, peach and a hint of wet stone."
Spain,83.0,5.0,Yecla,Terrenal,"Light plum and red-berry aromas lead to a racy, fresh palate with little body or structure. Candied raspberry and plum flavors are fresh but don't change or improve on the finish."
US,93.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"Intensely aromatic, with lovely accents of pine needle, grapefruit and mint. An elegant, complex and vividly spicy wine, with all elements proportionate, and showing excellent depth and structure. The flavors of fruit and forest just keep unfolding through a lingering finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Contra Costa County,Cline,"This has bright raspberry and almost-sweet blackberry flavors, full body, moderate tannins and a long warm finish. It tastes polished, soft and satiny smooth."
France,85.0,12.0,CÃ´tes du Lot,Pelvillain FrÃ¨res,"This dark purple wine expresses the bold blackberry flavors of Malbec. It has ripe fruit, soft tannins and a generous richness. The aftertaste adds some freshness. Drink from the end of 2016."
Italy,90.0,16.0,Alto Adige,Nals Margreid,"It opens with a delicate floral fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a whiff of apple and Alpine herbs. The steely, linear palate delivers juicy yellow apples together with a mineral note and lively acidity."
US,93.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"There's no other area this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (84%) and Merlot could come from than The Rocks. Wafting aromas of earth, mineral, green leaves and funk accent the variety's dried herb. It's soft in feel with elegant tannins and abundant savory flavors, simultaneously distinctive and delicious."
US,86.0,20.0,El Dorado,Auriga,"A bright red wine rustic in black plum and cherry flavor, lightweight and easy, a rightful companion to spaghetti and meatballs or even a BLT."
Italy,95.0,125.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Zenato,"This is a real beauty, with huge intensity and loads of deep chocolate fudge, black cherry, cola, barbecue and black licorice flavors. It manages contrasting tones of sweet versus savory that pleasure the tastebuds. The palate is rich, smooth and superconcentrated."
US,85.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Swedish Hill,"Sour red-cherry and tart cassis notes abound on this brisk, slightly puckery Bordeaux blend. Medium bodied in style, it's refreshing on the palate with a cool mineral tone, but could benefit from a boost of concentration."
US,89.0,20.0,California,Champy,"Very crisp, very lean, and very lively, this wine is driven by great fruit acidity and has a refreshing lip-smacking blend of tart apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors. It will be an attention-getting drink before dinner."
Spain,89.0,30.0,Montsant,La Universal,"Baked and rubbery up front, with asphalt, roasted peanut and black fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's solid and stately, with black plum and raspberry flavors, good balance and a taught, muscular structure. It tastes bright and mildly complex. Drink now through 2014."
US,89.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Burgess,"Good for Burgess for holding this Syrah back for a little while. It's beginning to soften, just barely. The tannins are still strong, but you can taste those bright blackberries and cherries starting to show meaty hints of wild grilled portobello mushrooms. It will drink well in late 2014 with hearty roasts and stews."
US,88.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Thomas George,"Minty bay leaf and leather define this wine in a savory, earthy way, with a strong notion of forest floor at its core. Firm tannins and subtle oak contribute a leathery aspect to the texture."
US,90.0,23.0,Columbia Valley (WA),DaMa,"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness."
US,85.0,16.0,Yolo County,Berryessa Gap,"Lots of fruity richness in this dry Syrah. Shows blackberry, chocolate, licorice and pie crust flavors. The tannins are somewhat unbalanced, suggesting work needs to be done in the vineyard."
France,88.0,25.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Saint-Maur,"One of the CÃ´tes de Provence classed growths, this wine is soft and rounded. Its fresh, lightly candied character is offset by the firmer tannins from Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre in the blend. Ripe and full and fruity in the mouth, it has only light acidity at the end."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Boca,Podere ai Valloni,"Graceful and fragrant, this boasts alluring scents of rose, aromatic herb, flint, red berry and culinary spice. The elegant palate delivers red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and star anise alongside bright acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018??026."
US,85.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Dunning Vineyards,"High alcohol and very ripe fruit combine to make this reminiscent of Port. It tastes of black currant and blackberry jam, with a hint of raisin. Although it won't please everyone, it is a good example of its warm-climate style."
US,90.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"William Church has outdone itself with this new Viognier, a mix of fruit from Conner Lee and Gamache Vineyards. A leesy, yeasty, textural underpinning complements the tangy lemon, lime, grapefruit and tangerine flavors. It's superfresh and delicious."
US,84.0,20.0,Dry Creek Valley,Plungerhead,The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.
Italy,89.0,52.0,Lessona,Tenute Sella,"Underbrush, scorched earth, espresso and exotic spice aromas open. The taut, linear palate offers dried sour cherry, coffee bean and grilled sage alongside a backbone of austere, fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish."
US,87.0,20.0,Arroyo Seco,Ventana,"Barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging add buttery, creamy, spicy complexities to this clean, steely wine. The underlying fruity flavors are not intense and veer toward leaner citrus and green apple flavors. It's a focused wine, not overblown. ?S.H."
France,85.0,15.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Domaine Luquet,"This wine has lemon peel and apple skin flavors that come through the firm, tangy structure. It has richness and the potential to age for the medium term. The finish is full of refreshing acidity."
US,89.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Sonnet,"The fine vineyard expresses itself in the ripe flavors and textural balance of this Pinot Noir. It shows flavors of baked cherries, red currants and cola, with smoky pie crust notes from oak. A bit tight and aloof, so give it a good decant. Now??012."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Sicilia,Brugnano,"V90 is a soft red with bold fruit concentration and sweet aromas of jammy fruit, candied almond, vanilla and Christmas spice. It's a well-made wine with an easy approach and a bold mouthfeel."
US,83.0,25.0,Applegate Valley,Plaisance Ranch,"This is half Merlot, with Pinot Noir, Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon divvying up the other half?a completely different Ranch Red than in 2013. It's sweaty and short, with some off flavors in the finish."
US,87.0,8.0,California,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,"Likeable for its extreme dryness and crisp acidity, and the way the citrus fruits and minerals tickle the palate and prepare it for food. It's a great cocktail wine, with lime, Meyer lemon, white peach and floral flavors."
Spain,87.0,16.0,PenedÃ¨s,AgustÃ­ TorellÃ³ Mata,"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Alto Adige,Erste Neue,"Varietal aromas of tomato vine, elderflower, gooseberry and citrus lead the nose and follow through to the palate along with grapefruit, sage and mineral. Racy acidity leaves a crisp finish."
France,90.0,13.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau La Mothe du Barry,"The wine has been heavily extracted, giving an initial bitter coffee and a dry tannic character. The fruit weight will compensate for this, bringing out acidity, black plums and rich berries. It has the right concentration to age, so drink from 2017."
US,90.0,28.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"This bubbly is simply irresistable, from the pale coppery color to the aromas of raspberries, limes, and apricots to the subtle fruity flavors. The texture is notable for its smooth creaminess, and the wine is dry and very clean. Superb balance suggests ageability, but it?s so delicious now, why wait? 91% Pinot Noir, 9% Chardonnay."
US,92.0,60.0,Mount Veeder,Crosby Roamann,"Shows the hallmarks of a fine Mount Veeder Cabernet, namely immediate succulence, intensely concentrated mountain fruit, and yet an almost certain capacity to age. Lush, ripe flavors of blackberries and crÃ¨me de cassis lead to a long, soft finish. Drink now??018."
US,86.0,22.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"More useful than rich, this Cab is dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, black currant, herb and smoky oak flavors. Drink now."
Italy,90.0,55.0,Isola dei Nuraghi,Argiolas,"Made with 90% Nasco and 10% Malvasia, this full-bodied dessert wine opens with intense aromas of tangerine zest, dried fruit and a whiff of baking spice. The rich palate delivers mature apricot, roasted hazelnut and orange-blossom honey. A vanilla note closed the lingering finish."
US,84.0,52.0,Paso Robles,Dilecta,"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up."
US,87.0,8.0,California,Oak Grove,"Here's a Pinot Grigio that fulfills the variety's basic responsibilities of dryness, crispness and a clean mouthfeel. It's a drily brisk, racy wine, with suggestions of ripe pink grapefruit, lemongrass and honeysuckle."
US,86.0,24.0,Napa County,Muscardini,"From a Lovall Valley location, this light white is intense in pear and peach, with a nuttiness to the strong, viscous foundation of oak. It finishes crisply like a twist of lime."
US,89.0,40.0,Arroyo Seco,Scratch,"This is a sweetly gentle, attractive wine for drinking now with steak, lamb chops or any meat with a smoky, charred edge. It shows delicious cherry pie, moo shu plum sauce and spice flavors, with a silky texture. Made from 100% Grenache, it's balanced by fine acidity. The oak influence is rich but subtle."
France,93.0,90.0,Hermitage,Cave de Tain,"With its massively concentrated blackberry fruit framed in ample new oak, this bears a bit of resemblance to some Australian Shirazes. It's mouthfilling but supple, with nuances of Christmas spices like cinnamon, clove and anise that linger on the long finish. Drink 2014??023."
Italy,92.0,36.0,Recioto di Soave Classico,Gini,"Made with dried Garganega grapes, this opens with heady aromas of passion fruit, dried nectarine slices and candied lemon. Concentrated and juicy, the delicious palate doles out peach jam, acacia honey and pastry alongside bright acidity that adds freshness."
US,86.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Passion Vineyards,"Mango, presumably, is the dog pictured on the label. This is a heavily-extracted, somewhat bitter Merlot, with fruit flavors of blackberry syrup, alcohol at 15%, and still a fair amount of green bitterness to the tannins. Notes of iodine and anise come into play in the finish."
Spain,82.0,16.0,Rioja,Dominio del Viento,"Cheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Loacker,"Not very expressive, it opens with subdued aromas that recall lemon peel and toast. These carry over to the palate along with a note of butterscotch. There's not enough fruit richness to support the racy acidity."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Generic but pleasant berry aromas are a touch powdery and dusty. This feels medium to full in body. Dry spice notes are intermixed with generic berry flavors prior to a slightly oaky, lightly minty finish."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Langhe,Ca' del Baio,"This Riesling from Piedmont has a fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a hint of honey and beeswax. The palate is nervy and fresh, showing ripe pear, white pepper, clove and honey notes."
US,89.0,19.0,Lodi,Borra,"The best red Fusion in memory, this wine combines 60% Syrah, 20% Petite Sirah, 17% Zinfandel and 3% Alicante Bouschet into a leathery, brambly package of big-boned intensity rich in blue and black fruit. Cherry and chocolate intermingle in pleasing ways, a hearty wine for the table, especially alongside Liberty duck."
Argentina,88.0,12.0,La Rioja,Recuerdo,"This is citrusy and also a bit tropical on the bouquet, and together the aromatic mix is appealing. A fresh mouthfeel is a bonus, and standard TorrontÃ©s flavors of melon, lychee and banana finish with balance and bright acidity. This hails from La Rioja, and it captures most of what's good about the variety."
Italy,88.0,34.0,Chianti Classico,San Leonino,"This slowly reveals subdued aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched soil, violet, dark spice and a hint of espresso. The palate is on the lean side, with a sprinkling of clove, white pepper and a coffee note adding interest to the core of dried black cherry. Dusty tannins grip the close."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Agricola Querciabella,"This youthful and fruit-forward Chianti Classico is balanced and fresh with bright berry and raspberry aromas that give it a cheerful, bright personality. The wine is fresh and zesty on the close and would pair with creamy vegetable risotto."
Italy,87.0,45.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Monteci,"At a whopping 17.5% alcohol, this powerful Amarone delivers heat, brawn and loads of mature cherry, ripened blackberry and tobacco. You can feel the burn on the close so be careful to pair this wine with a hearty winter dish that will soak it all up."
Australia,90.0,19.0,South Australia,Penfolds,"Attractive blackberry aromas with bright tobacco and herb accents open this well-balanced wine. The palate shows strong cassis, earth and herb flavors, and an even mouthfeel. Finishes with dark cherry notes and full, fine tannins. This will age nicely and can use a little time. Quite flavorful and elegant."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,San Fabiano Calcinaia,"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of sun-baked soil, iris, baking spice and plum. The warm palate offers black berry, dried black cherry, espresso and tobacco alongside raspy tannins that leave a drying finish."
France,89.0,63.0,Champagne,Jacquart,"A rich, soft, well- balanced wine. There is crispness, but this is given character by toast from some good bottle age, at least in the sample tasted here. The wine is suffused with white fruit flavors, which give a soft, creamy aftertaste."
US,85.0,6.0,Washington,Two Vines,"Reserved aromas of spice, pear and lychee are followed by medium-sweet flavors. Pair it with yellow curry."
US,87.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Renegade,"This wine is mostly Syrah (80%) with the rest made up of Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache. A pretty pale pink color, it's aromatically expressive with fruit-filled notes of strawberry and cherry. The palate contains the slightest suggestion of sweetness, with light-bodied orange-peel and tart fruit flavors that draw out on the finish."
US,90.0,48.0,Chehalem Mountains,Lachini,"The winery's top cuvÃ©e is notable for its perfume of rose petals with a subtle whiff of body talc. Balanced and feminine, this soft and graceful wine glides across the palate with flavor highlights of cherries and plums. Drink now while it's at its best."
Italy,90.0,57.0,Cortona,Avignonesi,"Desiderio, a legendary Italian Merlot, shows slightly sour aromas this vintage with cherry, pressed flowers, natural rubber and spice. It's a hearty, well-concentrated wine with loads of density and intense cherry fruit on the close."
US,91.0,19.0,Mendocino County,Monte Volpe,"This is a hefty wine that's also well-polished and well balanced. Wonderful aromas and flavors blend cedar, cinnamon, tobacco, red cherry and black plum, while a blanket of fine-grained tannins wraps everything up in an appetizing grip."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dunham,"Bright aromas of toast, spice and pear are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors that persist on the finish."
France,95.0,180.0,Clos de Vougeot,Alex Gambal,"This dark, brooding wine is still tight and closed. It's powerful and concentrated, with gripping tannins as well as delicious black fruits. It's solid, chunky and very firm while retaining the generous fruitiness of the vintage. Don't drink before 2020."
Argentina,87.0,14.0,Mendoza,Vila,"Shows pretty good concentration and depth on the nose, where it only slightly hints at the herbal character that comes later. The palate is a touch astringent, with cola, blackberry and herbal flavors. Persistent on the finish, but also herbal and not overly complex."
Italy,90.0,100.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Podere Le Ripi,"Aromas of Mediterranean herb, espresso, mocha and a balsamic note slowly take shape. The elegant, almost ethereal palate offers raspberry compote, red cherry, coffee bean and a hint of white pepper framed in tightly-wound but polished tannins. Drink 2020??028."
US,95.0,75.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Westerly,"From the Happy Canyon-based team behind the ultra luxury Crown Point project comes this bottling, offering a taste of the high life for a slightly more affordable price. Pressed blueberry, black cherry and sour plum aromas mesh with dried oregano, bay leaf, black pepper and pencil shavings on the nose. There's lots of depth to the palate, with dark olallieberry, eucalyptus oil and pine needle flavors leading into a hazelnut, caramel, coffee and vanilla finish."
Australia,92.0,20.0,Barossa Valley,Atze's Corner,"Made and grown by one of Barossa's most highly respected wine families, the Kalleskes, this Shiraz is a complex specimen of dried cherries, herbs and beef marinade, with soft tannins and a long, savory finish. It's elegant and silky without having to flex its muscles."
US,89.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Sonoma-Cutrer,"Sonoma-Cutrer's Pinots have been disappointing in the past, but this release is a huge improvement. It's dry, silky in the mouth, and complex in flavors, offering hints of sour-cherry candy, red licorice, prosciutto, cola and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Best enjoyed now for its richness."
US,82.0,28.0,Paso Robles,Midnight,"Lots of exotic citrus, peach and tropical fruit flavors in this crisply clean blend, but it's really too sweet to qualify as a dry table wine. Tastes more like something you'd have for dessert."
US,88.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Cosa Obra,"A taste of Key lime and tonic unveil a vibrancy of aroma and high-acid flavor in this wine, additionally characterized by layers of crisp white peach and pineapple juice."
France,88.0,37.0,Champagne,Bernard Remy,"Based in the CÃ´te de SÃ©zanne, this producer has created a Pinot Noir-dominated blend. Its white stone-fruit aromas and soft texture point to a wine that is generous with its fruitiness, citrus and pear flavors leading the way. The wine is soft with a relatively high dosage. It is ready to drink."
Italy,87.0,12.0,Salento,Castello Monaci,"This is a well-crafted, elegant wine with pretty mineral tones that frame a core of black cherry and spice. The wine offers the precise qualities?structure, good freshness and clean fruit aromas?that promise a successful pairing with most Mediterranean foods."
US,87.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Clos La Chance,"Made in the popular style of ripe fruit, oak and soft creaminess. The pineapple jam, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors are attractive, and brightened by crisp acidity."
US,83.0,17.0,Washington,Diversion,Faint aromas of yellow apple and pear lead to lightly creamy but dilute stone and tropical fruit flavors.
Italy,87.0,13.0,Trentino,Cembra,"Aromas of banana, wisteria and green pear lead the nose on this refreshing white. The bright, juicy palate offers tart Granny Smith apple and citrus zest alongside tangy acidity."
US,92.0,43.0,North Fork of Long Island,Harbes Family Vineyard,"Juicy and ripe yet zesty and bright?balance is the key to this deeply satisfying red blend. It's a lavishly fruity wine from nose to finish, wafting of sun-kissed plums and cherries. But the palate maintains a brisk, upright demeanor, boasting vibrant acidity and a fine persistent frame of tannins. The finish is supple and silky with just a hint of lingering nut skins."
US,89.0,21.0,Antelope Valley of the California High Desert,Coruce,"One of this new appellation's strongest showings, this SÃ©millon offers dried apple, dried mango, smoke and strawberry blossoms aromas on the nose. The palate is very intriguing, with flavors of roasted apples and pears, squeezed lime, lemon rinds and a sprinkle of vanilla on the finish."
US,88.0,20.0,Santa Margarita Ranch,Ancient Peaks,"Blackberry, black pepper, crushed rocks and a touch of herbs show on the nose of this always solid-for-the-price bottling from this crew in southern Paso. There is firm structure on the sip, with soy and peppercorn giving umami touch to the blackberry syrup and purple flower flavors."
US,87.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"The Estate bottling, at least at the moment, is a light and delicate wine, with more than a hint of beetroot and stem. The cherry fruit is pleasant and a bit thin, but the wine has some complexity, which shows in the residual flavors of orange peel."
US,90.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Chappellet,"This effort is similar to Chappellet's past vintages, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors, tastefully accented by oak and brightened with a squeeze of lemony acidity."
US,84.0,16.0,Monticello,Jefferson Vineyards,"A subdued note of vanilla cake adds dimension to the broad, white-fruit-driven nose. Medium in body, this easygoing wine feels a bit loose on entrance, finishing with a subtle mineral hint."
US,91.0,75.0,Willamette Valley,Elk Cove,"The Roosevelt vineyard bottling goes from strength to strength as it shows nuances of root, sassafras, black cherry and cassis. This vintage is bigger and heavier than previous bottlings, adding sweet fruit but taking away some of the leafy, herbal flavors. Depending upon your attitudes about Pinot Noir and alcohol, you may applaud these changes or bemoan them, but you can't deny it's a delicious bottle with power and structure."
US,87.0,14.0,Sonoma County,Rodney Strong,"Not a bad price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this interest. You'll find a burst of pine-apple, lemongrass, fig and vanilla honey flavors, with the dryness and scoury acidity you want in this variety. Partial barrel fermentation adds a creamy richness to this polished wine."
France,88.0,25.0,Coteaux du Giennois,Florian Roblin,"This fresh, crisp wine has plenty of lively citrus fruits that are enriched by red apple and zesty orange flavors. The wine is already delicious in its fruitiness and ready to drink."
Italy,90.0,62.0,Barolo,Brangero,"Iris, menthol, perfumed berry and chopped mint aromas come together in this. The savory, approachable palate delivers crushed raspberry, juicy red cherry, star anise and cinnamon notes framed by velvety tannins. Drink 2018??023."
US,87.0,10.0,Sierra Foothills,Clos du Lac,"A very bright, citrusy Sierra Foothills Sauvignon Blanc, very fairly priced, that tastes of cool lemonade on a summer's day."
US,90.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole ?owns??SÃ©millon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape. Aged sur lie in neutral oak, blended with 14% Sauvignon Blanc and put through malolactic for added creaminess, this is a delicious, rich and succulent wine that deftly mixes flavors of nettle, lime and melon with vanilla custard and a hint of butterscotch."
US,89.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Wedell Cellars,"Rich aromas of concentrated raspberry, dried strawberry, beet juice, clove, turned loam, rose petals and forest floor show strongly on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers a lush body, with mocha, mace, and Indian spice, along with a touch of tart cranberry and dark soil."
France,86.0,13.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Clos Moulin Pontet,"The wine is bright and fruity with a youthful character of red-berry flavors. As this all calms down, the ripe fruit will show well, balanced by some firm tannins. Drink from 2018."
Spain,88.0,26.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de Murrieta,"Cherry and raspberry aromas lead the charge, but as it airs out it becomes more raisiny and jammy smelling. The flavors are solid but distant, with simple red fruit, oak and barrel notes setting the pace. Highly drinkable and easygoing but not complex or elevated."
Italy,85.0,16.0,Venezia,Bosco del Merlo,"Modest aromas of cut grass, white flower and citrus establish this as an easy-drinking white. The finish is marked with a touch of green lime. It should pair well with shrimp cocktail or basil pesto."
US,86.0,18.0,Contra Costa County,Rosenblum,"Meaty, smoky flavors mark this dark and full-bodied wine, adding a layer of interest to the ripe blackberry and black-pepper notes underneath. The color is extremely dense and the tannic texture stops just short of extreme."
US,90.0,35.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Lullaby,"Fermented and aged in neutral oak, this mixes the richness of Chardonnay with the herbaceous tang of Sauvignon Blanc?but flavors notwithstanding, it's in fact pure Viognier. Excellent mouthfeel and structure carry the light and pretty fruit onto the finish that shows just a hint of barrel toast."
US,87.0,48.0,Santa Maria Valley,Sierra Madre,"Rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice, cola and sandalwood, this Pinot finishes dry and spicy. It has a lovely, silky mouthfeel, yet is quite sharp in acidity, and a bit one-dimensional. Best now."
France,88.0,17.0,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,"A very light yellow-plum fruitiness colors nose and palate of this fresh, easy and soft white. Plummy friendliness is matched by equally sunny lemon freshness, resulting in a balanced, fruity, easy-drinking wine."
US,86.0,13.0,California,Kendall-Jackson,"A soft, almost sweet version of a typically more crisp varietal, this is fruity, smooth in texture and uncomplicated. It has fresh citrus and apple flavors."
US,89.0,42.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Iota Cellars,"A scent of leathery funk inhabits this wine, yet never overtakes the balanced flavors. A mix of blueberry and cherry fills the palate with lush flavors, and highlights of coffee, mocha and salted caramel add further interest. It drinks as a more mature wine than the vintage date might suggest."
Australia,89.0,25.0,Barossa Valley,Sieber Rd,"Despite tipping the scales at more than 15% alcohol, this wine actually comes across as nicely structured and elegant. It's certainly not a fruit bomb, instead offering a complex array of sour plum, espresso, olive and coffee notes to go with its blueberry fruit. It's round without being fat, framed by supple tannins that turn slightly dusty on the finish. Drink now-2016."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Montefalco Rosso,Tenute Lunelli,"Exotic spice, plum, French oak and underbrush aromas lead the nose while the juicy palate offers espresso, raspberry jam and a hint of star anise. It's chewy, with close-grained tannins."
US,90.0,35.0,North Fork of Long Island,Harbes Family Vineyard,Plump lusciously ripe black plum and cherry flavors are offset by a tantalizing edge of acidity and fine penetrating tannins in this neatly composed Malbec. It's supple and full in body yet refreshing and brisk. Drinks well already but should continue to improve through 2021.
US,94.0,78.0,Russian River Valley,Arista,"From one of the winery's two estate vineyards, Harper's is dense and oaky, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry and black tea twisted around a layer of thick, dense tannins. Dried herbs and a subtle squeeze of tangerine provide savory and exotic character, while the finish is velvety and sublime."
France,90.0,13.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Les Petits Arnaud,"Big on tannins and equally big on ripe fruit, this is a rich wine. Its dense texture and bold blackberry flavors are coming together well. Drink from 2021."
US,88.0,18.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),SoDo,"It's an extreme rarity to find a Walla Walla Valley Cabernet Sauvignon at this price. Being 100% varietal, it offers reserved aromas of dates and plum. The flavors are full bodied and lush, exhibiting tacky tannins and whiffs of game."
US,91.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Alexana,"This rosÃ© brings extra levels of finesse and detail along with the expected burst of fresh fruit. Elegant and sophisticated, it offers tart cherry fruit, some peppery herb and a hint of fresh-ground coffee. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it's smooth as silk."
Spain,87.0,10.0,Cava,Berberana,"Simple lime and salinic aromas are clean and fresh. The palate is juicy and tight, with lime, apple and dry spice flavors. Finishes balanced and citrusy, with proper length and mouthfeel. A good but regular Cava that's done right for the price."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,Cruz Alta,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet."
US,88.0,28.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Cloudlift Cellars,"Aromas of toast, burnt coffee, mocha, vanilla, herbs and cherry take the lead on this wine. The milk chocolate and cherry flavors are elegant yet rich in style, with the oak at times seeming a little overweighted."
US,88.0,18.0,Amador County,Terra d'Oro,"Super-spicy, offering a blast of white and black pepper, briary blackberry, black cherry sour candy, cola and coffee flavors wrapped into vigorous tannins. Retains the basically rustic nature of Barbera, but it's one of the better ones out there. Try as a smoother alternative to Zinfandel."
US,88.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Chronic Cellars,"This Zinfandel-based wine, which blends 13% Tempranillo and 6% Petite Sirah, shows strawberry, cherry, baking spice and cola aromas. There is decent tannic tension on the palate, and the flavors?sarsaparilla, cola, stewed plum and clove spice?are easily enjoyable."
France,90.0,33.0,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,"Honey, honeysuckle and peach on the nose create a most inviting aroma. These flavors are even more clearly apparent on the medium-dry palate where they are brightened and intensified by lemon freshness. This is intense and fluid, rounded and soft, and yet it manages to remain fresh and appetizing. Drink soon."
Argentina,86.0,14.0,Mendoza,Kaiken,"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy."
US,86.0,14.0,Sonoma County,Kenwood,"Here's your basic everyday Zindandel at a good-value price. It's dry and tannic, with spicy flavors of blackberries and plums. Easy to drink, and it gains traction as as it warms in the glass."
France,84.0,9.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Marquis de Chasse,"With a nose of spicy green herbs?notably tarragon?and flavors of lemon and pink grapefruit, this no-nonsense blend of 50% Sauvignon Blanc and 50% SÃ©millon goes down easy and clean. The crisp finish is a good palate-cleanser."
US,90.0,20.0,California,CULT,"While obviously not a ?cult??wine, this full-bodied bottling has just what the varietal should offer in terms of ripe fruit, spice, a firm and moderately tannic texture, and a mouthfilling presence. Its strengths lie in good balance, tempting layers of flavor and a lingering finish."
US,91.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Benziger,"Fans of ripe, forward fruit will like this wine. Opens with a burst of jammy plum and cassis and then explodes into fruit and berry sensations on the palate, but it's classically dry. Soft tannins and acids support all these luscious flavors. The finish is really long and spicy."
US,82.0,28.0,Red Hills Lake County,Obsidian Ridge,"Unfortunately underripe, with an asparagus and pepper taste to the coffee and currants. Lacks fruity richness."
France,88.0,34.0,Givry,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"This is a young, perfumed wine with attractive red fruits. While the wood is showing at the moment, that will fade as the wine develops, giving a fresh, raspberry-dominated wine. Drink from 2018."
US,85.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Michael Florentino,"Generic red fruit flavors are set in a light wine with a slightly chalky finish. In the nose there are hints of volatility and leather, but it's perfectly quaffable."
US,85.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Standing Sun,"This is a soft, seemingly sweet, simple wine. Although it's luscious in raspberry, cherry, orange zest and cinnamon spice notes, it's pretty one-dimensional."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Sicilia,Planeta,"Here is a deeply saturated Chardonnay with a golden color and thick notes of candied fruit, almond, butterscotch and a playful hint of pecorino cheese rind. The wine is thick and succulent in the mouth, with a soft approach that is capped by a piquant, almost spicy finish."
Italy,90.0,60.0,Alta Langa,Gancia,"Rich and creamy, this has alluring aromas of ripe orchard fruit, toasted bread crust and a whiff of honey. The smooth palate doles out mature yellow apple, candied nectarine zest and toasted hazelnut framed in fresh acidity and an elegant mousse."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Cerasuolo di Vittoria,Terre di Giurfo,"Aromas suggest mature berry, scorched earth, animal, toast and anise. The palate offers ripe black berry, oak, espresso, cocoa and vanilla alongside dusty tannins."
US,91.0,35.0,Southern Oregon,Abacela,"Fragrant and dense, this sends up a lush, intriguing mix of aromas?black fruits, lead pencil, rock and green tea. It's a textural, earthy wine that never stops coming at you. The barrel aging brings in smoke and bacon fat also; this is full-bodied and complex, with substantial tannins and a strong, intense finish."
France,88.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau le Doyenne,"Ripe and juicy, this attractive offering from winemaker Marie-Dominique Watrin has a rich seam of blackberry fruits and balanced acidity. The aftertaste with its fresh character shows that the wine is nearly ready to drink; enjoy from the end of 2016. The 20 acres of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc vines are hand picked; no herbicides are used."
US,91.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Tobacco Road,"Rich and velvety on the palate, this Pinot is cohesive in soft, pretty layers of light spice and red raspberry and cherry. Nuanced, it develops complexity as it goes, finishing as it started, rich and velvety."
Spain,85.0,11.0,Toro,Tierras Guindas,"Brambly, lightly herbal aromas of berry fruit, sugar beet and a touch of chemical precede a wiry, narrow palate with briary flavors of herbal berry and cassis. A tannic, crimped finish is rugged and houses cherry flavors and heat."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Barbera d'Alba Superiore,Veglio,"Light-bodied and lacking in tannin, this is a more traditional Barbera, with attractive mixed berry fruit on the nose, followed by forest floor and graham cracker flavors in the mouth. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Lugana,Zenato,"Aromas of toasted oak, mature orchard fruit, and baking spice open. The medium-bodied palate offers yellow apple skin, grapefruit, butterscotch and toasted nut alongside bright acidity. A graphite note signals the close."
US,88.0,13.0,California,Carnivor,"An intensely dark color makes this wine easy to pick out, even from across a room. The chocolate, raisin and blackberry-jam flavors are rich and the texture is mouthcoating, almost thick, but not harshly tannic. The wine seems to start out dry and finish ripe and rich."
US,90.0,55.0,Moon Mountain District Sonoma County,Korbin Kameron,"Smoke and oak pronounce themselves vigorously on the nose and entry of this 100% varietal wine, which holds on with a tight grip. Black fruit dominates with leather, chocolate and tobacco playing secondary roles. The finish is lengthy and powerful."
Spain,87.0,11.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,"Cherry and berry aromas are earthy, ripe and blocky. This feels round, complete and easy to drink. Flavors of loamy berry and black plum finish dusty and earthy, with just enough acidity to create length and modest complexity. This is 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo."
US,82.0,14.0,California,Echelon,"With Lodi fruit dominating the blend, this Cabernet is soft, sweet and simple. It has blackberry and cherry flavors."
US,84.0,20.0,California,Acronym,"This easy-drinking Cabernet has flavors of blackberry jam and toast, wrapped into firm tannins. It won't improve with age, so drink up with a juicy burger."
France,92.0,22.0,Morgon,Paul Beaudet,"Big, ripe and opulent, its ripe tannins balanced by perfumed red fruits. There is a solid core of dark and smoky dryness, a center that promises good aging. Already, though, the wine is showing its concentration and richness."
France,87.0,95.0,Champagne,Taittinger,"A blend dominated by Pinot Noir gives this ripe, pink rosÃ© its rich character. It is soft with some sweetness from the high dosage that makes it immediately accessible and easy to drink. In its cheerful bottle, it is definitely a party wine."
US,87.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Foppiano,"A solid Chardonnay, dry, oaky and rich, with nice, crisp acidity. Satisfies for its creamy wealth of pinapples, limes, pears and minerals."
US,87.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Carol Shelton,"Made in a sweet, candied style, with flavors of pineapples, mangoes, roasted almond granola and vanilla. Could almost serve as a dessert wine. Drink now."
Italy,84.0,25.0,Prosecco,Castellargo,"Very simple and straightforward, this easy expression of Prosecco carries forth crisp aromas of dried grass, pressed flower, honey, peach and citrus. There's creamy foam in the mouth that would pair with mozzarella."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Riecine,"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth. The hint of prune on the finish reflects the warm, challenging vintage, but this is a delicious, well-balanced wine. Enjoy soon. Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft."
US,90.0,24.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Storrs,"Not much of this variety comes from this mountainous appellation, but this bottling suggests it can work well. Hearty blackberry aromas are leveled by anise, sage, black rocks and a touch of pencil lead on the nose. The palate is very tight and minerally, with chipped-graphite flavors providing structure to the prominent black and purple fruits."
US,88.0,58.0,Paso Robles,Niner,"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up."
US,84.0,15.0,Washington,Moonbeam,"With 45g/L residual sugar, it drinks quite sweet but doesn't have the acidity to hold together its notes of green grapes, jasmine and stone fruit."
US,91.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Adelsheim,"Bright and spicy, this has flavors of melon and pear. Balanced throughout, it finishes with a lightly toasty accent. Superb winemaking shines here."
Italy,93.0,100.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Tenute Salvaterra,"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, leather, pressed violet, baking spice and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this full-bodied red. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, fig, mocha, tobacco and licorice alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. A coffee note closes the finish. Drink through 2022."
Italy,86.0,45.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Zeni,"This big bracing red opens with aromas of French oak, coconut and vanilla. Oak sensations dominate the dense assertive palate while astringent tannins leave a raspy finish."
France,86.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Marac,"Herbaceous and fruity, this has a textured character, with an orange zest note and a strong lemon juiciness. It's fresh and ready to drink, but it will likely age for a few years."
US,86.0,16.0,Arizona,Fiddlebender,"Arinarnoa (a crossing of Petit Verdot and Merlot), Merlot, Petit Sirah and Nebbiolo go into this diverse blend. A medium amount of chalky tannins and mild acids give shape to the molten chocolate and black cherry flavors. This finishes with light traction, plus notes of licorice and potpourri."
US,88.0,52.0,Dry Creek Valley,Wilson,"Soft and perceptively sweet, this densely built, full-bodied and intensely ripe wine layers brown sugar and baked plum notes, with a lingering taste of cola."
US,93.0,112.0,Oakville,B Cellars,"Sourced from the O'Shaughnessy Vineyard across from the producer's winery on Oakville Cross Road, this is a youthfully shy wine, firm in integrated and expansive tannin. Tobacco, clove, cedar and cherry interweave themselves flavorfully on the palate, with plenty of length shining through on the finish."
US,87.0,32.0,Paso Robles,Dunning Vineyards,"Juicy and jammy, this wine features sweet blackberry and cherry fruit, with a touch of smoky oak. The texture is a bit coarse, but a good broiled steak will wrestle those tannins into submission."
US,93.0,48.0,Red Mountain,Sparkman,"Dark and dense, without turning fat or heavy, this excellent Ruckus captures the underlying minerality of Red Mountain grapes. There's boysenberry and black cherry fruit, black coffee and wet rock. This is built for aging."
France,89.0,16.0,Morgon,Domaine DuprÃ©,"Tight and textured, this tannic and structured wine shows the power of very old vines. With dark fruits as well as tense bitter cherry acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017."
US,92.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Janzen,"This is a smooth, rich Cabernet whose fruity flavors are upfront, yet it has the complex, upscale structure of a great wine. With classic blackberry and crÃ¨me de cassis flavors, it's almost as good as its more expensive vineyard-designated brethren from Janzen, at half the price."
US,84.0,22.0,Applegate Valley,Valley View,"This is a tight, sharp, pungent Viognier, with penetrating scents of lemon oil and pine. In the mouth it is grapefruity and slightly bitter, with a perception of almond skin as it fades away."
France,91.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,"This is a really fragrant wine, with white hedgerow flowers that introduce its rich, full body. It has just a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear and quince flavors, although the texture also has a fine edge of minerality. Age for another 1?? years."
US,88.0,24.0,Amador County,Andis,"No doubt this is mountain grown Zin, still tight but revealing nice aromatics of cherry and spicy licorice on the finish, accompanied by a healthy helping of espresso, wrapped in smooth tannins all around. Should only get better over the next year or two."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Pietranera,"Structured and dense, this bold Brunello offers big color, density and extraction. On the nose, it is characterized by elegant oak tones of vanilla and spice that are married to bright cherry after tones."
US,87.0,25.0,California,The Illegitimate,"This is a very ripe-tasting broadly textured wine that's full bodied and fruity. Plum and prune aromas precede jammy, grapey flavors with light spicy accents. Blended from Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's soft in mouthfeel and low in acidity and tannins."
US,91.0,30.0,Santa Ynez Valley,KitÃ¡,"Chumash tribe descendent and Fresno State-trained winemaker Tara Gomez uses her extensive experience to make a solid lineup of wines. This one holds dense aromas of boysenberry extract, Dr Pepper, toast, condensed cedar and beef char. Elderberry is the dominant fruit flavor, showing both woodiness and dark purple fruit."
US,85.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Madrigal,"There's an inkling of Petite Sirah in this Cab-driven blend, an easygoing wine that's soft and enjoyable, with characteristics of herb, clove and black pepper. The fruit side of the equation is populated in black cherry and berry."
US,92.0,70.0,Sonoma Coast,Della,"Earth and rose petal notes open on the nose of this vineyard designate, a sultry and succulent wine that will please in its fullness of body and texture. Hearty blue and red berry flavors give it juiciness on the palate, seasoned with cola and cinnamon."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau du Bois Chantant,The wine is fruity and also textured. The acidity and dry tannin and wood flavors reveal a wine that will need to develop. It has weight and potential richness that will come out over the next couple of years. Drink this wine from 2018.
Italy,86.0,14.0,San Gimignano,San Quirico,"This certified organic white wine from San Gimignano opens with lively notes of citrus, dried hay, stone fruit and a touch of exotic papaya. The wine is fresh and zesty with a cool, cleansing finish."
US,91.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Signorello,"Made from 57% SÃ©millon, the rest Sauvignon Blanc, this proprietary, estate wine is 100% barrel-fermented and built to age, a studious take on sultry oak and viscosity. Golden Delicious apple highlights the taste experience, reaching rich, concentrated proportion, before the wine finds its balance on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
France,91.0,37.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"Full and ripe, the wine has smooth flavors of apricots, ripe apples and pears and a structure that includes wood tastes. It's a rich wine, hinting at spice and showing fresh, juicy acidity at the end. Drink until 2019."
US,90.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Provincial Vineyards,"This elegant wine puts flavors of apple and citrus with floral highlights into the mix. It gains strength in midpalate, finishing strong with cinnamon, paprika and white pepper."
US,88.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Pellegrini,"Young and tightly wound, this wine from the family's Olivet Lane Vineyard is reduced and generous in oak and spicy dark cherry, its aromas resplendent in rose petal. Layered and soft, it's big on complexity and plush textures, with a lengthy, caramel-and cola-laced finish."
US,89.0,14.0,Rogue Valley,Foris,"Although the 2011 vintage was difficult, Foris did particularly well with this lightly spicy, fruit-laden Pinot Gris. True varietal flavors of pear and apple are perfectly set against vivid acidity."
Spain,87.0,19.0,Priorat,Vicente Gandia,"Raspy cheesy fiery aromas of plum and raspberry are a bit harsh. This feels tannic and grabby, while inky berry fruit and resiny oak flavors finish hard and blocky with a mild note of schisty minerality."
France,86.0,11.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Miradou,"This is attractive, fruity and lightly balanced wine. It has great wild-strawberry flavors that are laced with just the right amount of acidity. The finish is tight and crisp."
US,91.0,35.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Crest,"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa and dark berries lead to full-bodied and velvety coffee, cherry and dark fruit flavors. The oak plays prominently but this wine is still pretty hard to resist."
Italy,89.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Donatella Cinelli Colombini,"Funky, earthy aromas dissipate in the glass to reveal mature black plum, espresso and vanilla. The forward, warm palate offers ripe?almost overripe?black cherry, layered with fleshy raspberry, coffee, and bitter chocolate sensations. It closes on a sweet, almost sugary note."
Argentina,89.0,28.0,Mendoza,Pentagon,"The bouquet on this Malbec is just right; it shows integrated aromas of smoke, cola, blackberry, cherry and brown sugar. The palate offers strong acidity, which keeps the wine racy. Black-fruit flavors dry up on the finish, which is a bit acidic. This is very good but lacks complexity."
France,88.0,25.0,MÃ¢con-Verze,Vignerons des Terres SecrÃ¨tes,"Reflecting the warm 2015 vintage, this is smooth and creamy. It has great fruitiness, recalling yellow fruit cut with a strong citrus streak. It's a wine to drink young, from late 2017."
US,89.0,23.0,Red Mountain,Kiona,"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon make up the majority of this wine. Light aromas of herb, coffee bean and barrel spice lead to cranberry and cherry flavors that bring a lot of enjoyment."
US,96.0,100.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Charles Smith,"This is the first time a King Coal has been made, all sourced from the Stoneridge Vineyard. It's a unique and delicious wine, seamless and complex. The flavors are amazingly detailed, with layer upon layer of candied fruit, raisins, Bourbon barrel, Asian spice, ginger, toast and more. The flavors pile on and continue into a seemingly endless finish, resonating into a spicy blend of fruit and Christmas cookies."
US,85.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cloudlift Cellars,"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored."
US,81.0,7.0,California,Barefoot Cellars,"Sugary sweet and simple, with watermelon and watery raspberry jam flavors."
France,85.0,13.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Les Hauts de Lagarde,"This crisp, lemon-flavored wine has a ripe, full character. It is rich with apples, apricots and delicious acidity at the end."
US,84.0,21.0,Amador County,Sonora,"Dark and deep purple/black, with a Port-like nose. There's a little fizz on the palate, which seems odd in a wine this big, and the flavors are locked in tight. Flat, dry, tannic finish."
France,86.0,14.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Rocher Bellevue,"A fruity wine from Bordeaux Vineam, this is ripe and full of red-berry fruits. It has tannins that are softening already to give an accessible wine that is rich and full. Drink from 2019."
US,93.0,27.0,Spring Mountain District,Smith-Madrone,"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity. Balanced and elegant, with a sunny bite of ripeness, it revels in nuances of fresh and dried apricot while lighter notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit play backup."
US,88.0,24.0,Amador County,Andis,"Andis's 100% Barbera tempts with ripe, dried black-cherry and mint flavors, and toasty layers of coffee and toffee that linger until the finish."
US,94.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Walt,"This is a bold, brawny red from a famous site, velvety in texture and all power and concentration. Forest floor and a touch of smoke complement juicy dark cherry, caramelized oak and licorice, while bright acidity supports the layers of flavor and strong tannins."
Italy,83.0,7.0,Chianti,Tiziano,"Opens with a complex nose of cherry, plum, cocoa and leather elements that promise much. On the palate, however, it turns much more tart?even sharp?with mild cherry fruit and a light body. Finishes with modest length and a sour cranberry-herb note."
US,90.0,36.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Margerum,"A blend of fruit from the McGinley and Grassini vineyards, this wine is fermented in oak barrels, yielding a nose that's an approachable buffet of nectarine, wet cement, chopped lemongrass and wet hay. The oak also gives the palate more weight to deliver flavors of green-apple slices, kumquat, lime zest and cut lawn."
Australia,88.0,15.0,Langhorne Creek,Zonte's Footstep,"Smooth, easy-drinking and lushly textured, this Verdelho features peach and grapefruit notes that stay refreshingly clean and crisp on the finish. It should work well as an apÃ©ritif or with many fish dishes."
France,90.0,56.0,Pomerol,Vieux ChÃ¢teau des Templiers,"This big, fruity black-colored wine has ripe stone fruit flavors and firm, ripe tannins. There is structure, obvious aging potential as well as ripe, sweet juicy Merlot fruit flavors. Age for 5-6 years."
US,87.0,22.0,Carneros,Clos Pegase,"Steely at first sip, and then oaky and midweight, this white reflects the vintage and the region, providing ripe creaminess and plenty of oomph. Made in a heavier style, it remains well-balanced in acidity, with a lengthy, tropical finish."
US,92.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Abeja,"Made from fruit that was sourced entirely from the 1.5-acre estate vineyard, this limited-production, Dijon-clone-based Chardonnay captures the essence of the Abeja style. Complex, stylish and buttery, it's a striking, fruit-laden wine. The long, clean finish mixes a flavor of citrus rind with a streak of butterscotch."
Italy,92.0,70.0,Bolgheri,Tenuta di Biserno,"Coronato is a robust, modern super Tuscan only produced for export markets. Indeed, you can sense a New World appeal within its rich, succulent fabric thanks to penetrating notes of coffee, espresso, tar, aniseed, chocolate and bursting cherry. It's soft and velvety with enormous charm."
US,83.0,25.0,San Luis Obispo County,Asuncion Ridge,"There's a hit of green gooseberry flavor in this dry, tart Sauvignon Blanc. It has enough citus and tropical fruit ripeness to make it tasty, but it's still a bit green and unripe on the palate."
US,89.0,30.0,Applegate Valley,Plaisance Ranch,"Big, bold and unreservedly stemmy, this CarmenÃ¨re pulls in enough black-cherry fruit to balance out the herbs. The assertive tannins carry notes of earth, dried leaf and dark chocolate."
Argentina,85.0,25.0,Mendoza,Mendel,"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit."
US,89.0,40.0,Santa Clara Valley,Sarah's Vineyard,"Fresh-pressed raspberry, plums, dried sagebrush, wild thyme and a touch of mustard plant show on the nose of this wine, recalling a hike through the chaparral. Light but ripe cranberry fruit shows on the easygoing sip, alongside oregano, vanilla and rhubarb."
US,86.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,Seghesio,"A tasty little sipper, built along Pinot Grigio lines. It's light-bodied and tart in acidity, with ripe pineapple, orange, vanilla and honey flavors. Great for picnics, the beach or as an appetizer with savory munchies."
Argentina,84.0,20.0,San Juan,Graffigna,"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalapeÃ±o, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas. Feels tight and zesty, with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato, oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish, but tastes green."
US,88.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),North by Northwest,"Aromas of lime leaf and citrus lead to sleek, dry fruit flavors, speckled with lime notes on the finish. Pair it with shrimp ceviche."
Italy,93.0,63.0,Terre Siciliane,Passopisciaro,"Fragrant, fresh scents of perfumed berry, blue flower, crushed stone and a hint of exotic spice meld together on this. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, white pepper, flinty mineral and a sprinkling of clove alongside bright acidity and silky, polished tannins. Drink 2018??023."
US,88.0,40.0,Sonoma County,Rock Wall,"There's nothing shy about this Zinfandel. A kick in the teeth, this exudes the concentrated fruit of Sonoma County's Rockpile area. It has hard tannins, and it's front-loaded with currant, licorice and tobacco flavors. Pair this with intensely-flavored, spicy grilled meats."
France,88.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Lamothe de Haux,"Although wood aging in this superior cuvÃ©e is prominent, this wine has just enough juicy black fruits to allow it to develop well. Get past the wood, and the wine is rich enough and structured with fruit tannins. Allow the wine to integrate and drink from 2017."
France,93.0,128.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This vineyard is at the heart of the fine run of premier crus that lie midway up the slope above the village. This wine is packed with fruit and also with intense acidity and minerality. It is already refreshing and crisp, although as the toastiness develops, it will become even more impressive. Drink from 2017."
Spain,86.0,25.0,Alicante,Enrique Mendoza,"Opens with air freshener, chemical notes, lime and pastis aromas. Overall it doesn't smell light and ethereal like some Moscatels, but it's honest and varietally correct throughout. Tastes of honey, candied mango and anise, with bitterness on the finish. Stirs some interest but has its weaknesses."
US,92.0,80.0,Red Mountain,Force Majeure,"This winery's young estate vineyard shows lots of promise. Aromas of dried herbs, bittersweet chocolate, mineral, licorice, raspberry and cherry lead to textured, rich cranberry flavors with a firm handshake of tannins and a tart, cranberry-filled finish. It needs time to all come together but has the stuffing to go the distance."
US,86.0,56.0,Sonoma Valley,Ledson,"Rich, plummy and oaky, this wine combines 52% Zinfandel and 48% Petite Sirah. The two varieties pack a punch of intensity and a plush mouthfeel, finishing with a touch of heat."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Veronese,Suavia,"This concentrated wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, dried flowers and a note of burned rubber. The palate offers lemon zest, dried apricot, golden apple, vanilla, oak, honey and a hint of flint."
US,90.0,26.0,Calistoga,Summers,"Made in a dry, earthy style, this wine chooses elegance and structure over dazzling opulence. And that's just fine. It has a good core of blackberry and currant fruit, and the balance suggests some time in the cellar. Give it 3?? years."
Australia,89.0,9.0,South Australia,Oxford Landing,"This wine may not be quite as rich or expressive as the other Viogniers in the Yalumba stable, but it's still an attractive effort. Pineapple and apricot flavors pick up hints of gingery spice on the vibrant finish. Drink now."
US,92.0,85.0,Anderson Valley,Black Kite,"Beautifully shaped and full bodied, this offers opulent ripe fruit aromas and rich, luxurious texture. Substantial concentrated flavors suggest dark cherry, clove and blackberry. There are no sharp edges yet the wine has firm tannins and a sense of good balance despite its weight."
Spain,89.0,60.0,Ribera del Duero,Pagos de Quintana,"This is a deep, hard wine with sandpaper tannins and chewy weight. Earth, mushroom, blackberry and raw oak are all present on the bouquet. Flavors of blackberry and plum are ripe and rich, with an herbal hint. The finish is long, heady, heavy and tannic. Drink through 2018."
Canada,90.0,26.0,Beamsville Bench,Cave Spring,"There is a refreshing minerality underscoring this tightly wound wine. Fruit flavors of grapefruit, lime and white melon carry a hint of spice. There's penetrating acidity, only slightly muted by the 13 g/L of residual sugar."
US,92.0,55.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cana's Feast,"Though not labeled as such, this is truly a Red Mountain wine with all of the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval and Taptiel vineyards. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it shows a mixture of fruit and barrel. Flavors of herbs, plum, oak spices and black currant offer impressive density and finish with a tart lick of acidity."
US,85.0,15.0,Lodi,Mustache Vineyards,"Medium-bodied, this wine's ripe fruit characteristics offer dark plum and golden raisin flavors. It will serve most basic wine needs."
US,91.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,MacPhail,"Plush and pillowy in texture and very ripe in flavor, this wine is smooth and delicious. The aromas are plummy and the flavors almost sweet, as subtle oak adds baking spices. Moderate tannins give a little structure while the balance leans to the soft side."
US,85.0,40.0,Yakima Valley,O?¢S Winery,"This was a difficult vintage, and the wine reflects it. It feels off-balance, with astringent, chalky tannins, and lean, simple fruit."
US,89.0,36.0,Oak Knoll District,Trefethen,"Crisp fruit unveils itself slowly in this classically refreshing wine, soft and medium in acidity and oak. It picks up additional ripeness on the finish, from mango to peach."
US,89.0,22.0,Paso Robles,Record Family Wines,"A great effort for the estate's inaugural white, this expertly restrained Viognier hails from a region where the grape tends toward overripeness. Crisp apple blossoms, daffodil, white peach and chalk aromas give way to a mellow palate of pear, apple, nectarine and jasmine-like flavors."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Montefalco Rosso,Milziade Antano,"Aromas of leather, prune, mature dark berry and carob lead the nose on this warm, brawny wine. The ripe palate offers fig, black cherry-marinated-in-spirits, licorice and tobacco alongside dense tannins. The heat of alcohol is evident on the midpalate."
Italy,90.0,17.0,Etna,Cottanera,"Vibrant and elegant, this offers aromas of wild flower and ripe red berry. The juicy palate doles out tart red cherry, fresh strawberry and mineral alongside tangy acidity. A mouthwatering saline note closes the bright finish."
Italy,93.0,35.0,Toscana,Pratesi,"The intensity of this powerhouse Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend is outstanding, and so is the density of its aromas. It presents a solid wall of blackberry, dark chocolate, pipe tobacco and cigar box. It's bold and syrupy and overwhelms the palate with its enormous bounty."
US,94.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Volker Eisele Family Estate,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a worthy followup to the extraordinary 2006 and 2007 vintages. Feels fine in the mouth, with rich tannins and dry, elegant flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and French oak. The tannins are pure Napa, smooth and complex. Not ready to drink now, but give it a good six years, and it could develop over the next fifteen."
US,87.0,34.0,Russian River Valley,Ektimo Vineyards,"Stewy plum and cherry jam lie at the heart of this densely layered, though silky-smooth wine, light bodied and ethereal despite the ripeness of fruit flavor. It finishes simply and without fuss."
US,84.0,25.0,California,Furthermore,"Few wineries make a dessert Pinot Noir, but here's Furthermore. The wine shows ripe raspberry and cherry flavors that are jammy sweet and softly simple."
US,84.0,55.0,Carneros,ZD,"There's not much going on here beyond lots of smoky, caramelized oak and some easy peach and citrus flavors. A touch of unripeness is also found. Chardonnnay has not been ZD's strong suit, and still isn't."
Spain,83.0,12.0,Campo de Borja,Pagos del Moncayo,"A heavily charred nose loaded with burnt oak dominates any fruity scents. In terms of flavors and feel, it's more of the same: roasted, burnt oak that's like licking a barrel or hickory branch. This is a one-dimensional oak bomb."
US,87.0,38.0,Carneros,Artesa,"Marked by crisp acidity and mint-infused cherry pie filling flavors, this Pinot finishes a bit sharp. It needs rich fare to soften it, like Ahi tuna or lamb."
France,84.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du Roussillon,Walden,"There's a strong funkiness to this wine, which can be called barnyard or even bordering on Band-Aid, that almost overwhelms the nose and mouth. Black plum and berry flavors struggle for dominance, while spicy oak controls the close."
US,93.0,39.0,Santa Maria Valley,Testarossa,"Just delicious. Superrich in pineapple, white peach and sweet lemon pie fruit, with crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and buttered toast complexities, its opulence is balanced by crisp acidity. The finish turns unexpectedly dry and clean. Very fine, a wonderfully grown wine from this great vineyard."
US,92.0,70.0,Paso Robles,Michael Gill Cellars,"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess."
France,90.0,32.0,Saint-PÃ©ray,Tardieu-Laurent,"This intriguing wine displays an almost fumÃ©-style smoky minerality on the nose, followed by flavors of pear and toast. It's a focused, medium-bodied blend of 50% Marsanne and 50% Roussanne, with a finish that won't quit."
US,87.0,24.0,California,Castello di Amorosa,"A little dark and heavy for a rosÃ©, with jammy flavors of raspberries, vanilla and brown sugar. It sure is tasty, however, especially with prosciutto, melons and figs."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Montescudaio,Pagani de Marchi,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with black cherry, white pepper and an earthy underbrush scents. The savory, straightforward palate shows plum, clove and tobacco notes, set against chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2019."
France,90.0,57.0,Alsace,Cave de Turckheim,"The granite soil of the Brand Grand Cru vineyard has produced a strongly structured wine that also has richness and ripe fruits. Off dry, it has a hint of honey as well as yellow fruits and pears. The aftertaste brings out the acidity and freshness that balance the wine. Drink from 2017."
Italy,89.0,36.0,Terre Siciliane,Colosi,"Made with 100% Moscato dried grapes, this offers aromas of mature apricot, tangerine zest and fennel. The aromas follow through to the palate along with orange blossom honey, date and pistachio. Fresh acidity brightens the sweet flavors. Pair it with cream-filled pastry or vanilla ice cream."
US,87.0,14.0,Oregon,Grandmaster,"This weaves spicy melon and pear flavors into a soft, smooth, fleshy and fruity core. Forward and accessible, it's best served chilled."
France,93.0,53.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Maison Champy,"Structured, ripe and with great fruit, this is a bold warm wine. It has plenty of rich berry fruits, ripe tannins and layers of spice and toast. With its concentration, this is going to be a rich wine. Drink from 2022."
Italy,89.0,19.0,Trento,Rotari,"This blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay features yeasty aromas of baked bread, ripe red apple and spice. The tangy palate delivers sour cherry, strawberry and candied nectarine alongside a ginger note and brisk acidity."
US,85.0,17.0,Russian River Valley,Hook & Ladder,"Made from Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet, this is an old-style wine, easy to drink with everyday fare. It's soft and sweet and fruity."
Argentina,85.0,9.0,Mendoza,Valentin Bianchi,"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price."
France,86.0,10.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau de Carolle,"An attractively balanced, fruity wine that shows to advantage the crisp lightness of 2007. There are red fruits, berries, raspberries, given structure by a core of dry tannins. The acidity and spice roll together in the final taste, with just an edge of green."
US,85.0,20.0,Rogue Valley,Weisinger's of Ashland,"From the winery's premier vineyard comes this inky, earthy wine with woodsy aromas. Flavors of plum and pie cherry dominate the fruit, along with a definite smoky, charred flavor, perhaps from overroasted barrels."
France,90.0,24.0,CÃ´te de Beaune-Villages,Joseph Drouhin,"A wine that reveals its rich, jammy fruit slowly. When it arrives, the fruit is soft and generous, with strawberry jam and red plum flavors. It also has intense fresh acidity, a dry tannic core and aging potential."
France,90.0,46.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau La Croix Lartigue,"With a medicinal hint, this is a wine that is all potential. At the moment, it is firm, dry and darkly tannic. The weight gives the promise, offering rich fruitiness in the future. Drink this impressive, concentrated wine from 2016."
France,94.0,236.0,Vosne-RomanÃ©e,Domaine Dujac,"With great richness, almost opulence, great ripe red fruits are folded into a powerful dark structure. The tannins are right up front, long-lasting and very structured. The final acidity offers freshness to a wine that will need aging."
US,93.0,45.0,Santa Barbara County,Ojai,"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover. It's full-bodied, dry and oaky, yet with its cherry, chocolate, fig and licorice flavors, offers a whole different flavor profile. Brilliiant with pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce or stuffing."
US,91.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Chimney Rock,"Vanilla and cream, cocoa, and herbs really jazz up the medium-berry nose. Dark sweet fruit in the mouth, with some earth and cedar for substance. Bitter chocolate and espresso add backbone to the medium-length finish. Good and balanced, and not bad for current consumption."
France,91.0,22.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,ChÃ¢teau Favray,"The wine is ripe, dense and with fine layers of green fruits, grapefruit and acidity. The flinty texture is still strong in this young wine which bursts with youthful fruitiness. It is going to develop well into an impressive wine. Drink from late 2018."
Argentina,86.0,10.0,Mendoza,Bodega Norton,"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak."
US,97.0,195.0,Napa Valley,Ovid,"With a beautiful purple color, this wine quickly exhibits classic Cabernet aromas of black currants and cedar. In the mouth, it's full bodied and concentrated, showing powerful, sweet blackberry fruit. It's incredibly refined, impressively structured, massive, impeccable and frankly delicious. This should develop over the next 20 years, at least."
Italy,88.0,26.0,Roero,Deltetto,"This Riserva Nebbiolo delivers a compact, streamlined style with crisp freshness that drives aromas of forest berry and cassis. The wine shows a dry, austere style with a slightly gritty texture."
US,87.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Larner,"This dry, powerful 100% Viognier dazzles with intensely ripe Meyer lemon, lime, peach, honeysuckle and oak flavors. With crisp acidity for balance, it's an opulent wine for drinking now."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Altesino,"This elegant wine opens with a pretty fragrance of pressed violets, perfumed berries aromas and sweet cake spices. The vibrant palate offers crushed black cherry, wild raspberry and clove alongside supple tannins. Drink soon to capture the fresh fruit flavors."
US,87.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Sextant,"This approachable, fruit-forward bottling offers prominent black cherry, anise and vanilla aromas. It's light in body, showing candied black fruit, licorice, cola and smoke flavors."
US,90.0,35.0,Hudson River Region,Millbrook,"Ripe, tropical mango and pineapple tones swirl from nose to palate in this plush, yet elegant Chardonnay. Creamy in texture and lavishly adorned with oak, vanilla and spice, it's a voluptuous wine, with a bold, slightly warming finish."
US,91.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Elevation Cellars,"Earth and olive streaks wrap around tight, compact fruit flavors of berry and plum. The aging in French oak??0% new?adds a light touch of spice without dominating. The tannins are clean, crisp and gently powdery."
US,91.0,27.0,Mendocino,Parducci,"Extremely flavorful and wonderfully exotic, this full-bodied wine has intense fruit flavors like raspberry and rhubarb, with a host of interesting accents recalling cedar, white pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is warm and rich, tannins are soft and easy, and the finish lingers nicely."
France,85.0,22.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Turcaud,This wine is soft and misses out on crisp fruitiness. Hints of the wood aging give some spice to the rounded wine.
US,85.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Churchill Cellars,"Silky and dry, but a bit harsh and raw around the edges, with some green, unripe flavors of mint accompanying the cherries and oak. Not likely to improve, so drink now, after a good decanting."
US,86.0,24.0,Carneros,Mahoney,"A good, standard Pinot Noir, dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors accented by smoky oak. Drink now."
US,87.0,16.0,Yakima Valley,Pacific Rim,"One of just a handful of varietal bottlings made in the state, this wine offers aromas of white pepper, fresh vegetables and flowers. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors."
US,90.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Waters,"Smelling of pure Syrah, annotated with rock and white pepper, this is graceful, muscular and compact. The wild blueberry fruit is not too sweet and has a clean, resonant finish. It still needs time to knit together and bring the barrel flavors into focus."
US,87.0,15.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"Always one of the best Muscats in California, Eberle's '09 continues the tradition. It offers tangerine, pineapple, vanilla cream and honeysuckle flavors in a frankly sweet wine finished with brisk, cleansing acidity."
US,86.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Cimarone,"This is a super-fresh, fruity wine meant to dazzle in sheer deliciousness now, not something to age. It's almost candied, with raspberry, cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors that are exuberant and easy to understand."
Argentina,87.0,13.0,Uco Valley,Finca la Celia,"Savory, grapy aromas include gamy notes and an herbal influence. A choppy, abrupt palate is gravelly in feel. Herbal plum and cranberry flavors are meaty and a touch green on the finish. For a Malbec that's not just about black fruits and oak, give this a shot."
US,86.0,32.0,Snipes Mountain,Upland Estates,"By ?Old Vine Cabernet??the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight."
France,93.0,129.0,Corton,Louis Latour,"An intense and concentrated wine, with dense black fruits balanced by acidity. There is ripeness here, with a firm, ageworthy structure as well as delicious juicy Pinot Noir character."
US,88.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"This wine is a little direct, but very tasty, showing rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cocoa and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into lovely tannins. A polished, pretty wine for drinking now."
US,91.0,20.0,Lodi,Hilt & Blade,"Solidly built and fruity without seeming sweet, this full-bodied wine combines concentrated flavors with a firm structure of fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. Light oak touches add interest, but the wine's power and appeal come from bold varietal-fruit flavors."
US,92.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Cobb,"This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Riscal,"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Sartori,"Sartori is one of Valpolicella's most important wineries thanks to its focused dedication to local winemaking traditions. This is not as thick or sweet as others. In fact, it shows an elegant, understated quality, with bright cherry and spice overtones."
Italy,97.0,81.0,Toscana,Castello Banfi,"The 2007 Excelsus is a gorgeous super Tuscan expression (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) that shows quality and superior fruit on all levels. Castello Banfi has really hit a home run with this vintage. You'll encounter persuasive aromas of cassis, blackberry, chocolate, tobacco, curry leaf and deep renderings of exotic spice. The wine's texture is exceedingly smooth, rich and long lasting."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Alto Adige,Andriano,"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with aromas of raspberry, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The juicy palate doles out ripe strawberry, mineral and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. Enjoy soon."
US,86.0,16.0,Mendocino,Bonterra,"This wine is flavorful and sturdy. Full bodied enough to accompany rich dishes, it's affordable, too. It has butter and caramel aromas, an almost thick, syrupy texture and firm tannins. Moderate cherry flavors accompany the oaky components."
Italy,89.0,27.0,Sicilia,Valle dell'Acate,"This delicious and velvety expression of Nero d'Avola opens with aromas of earth, ripe black berry, leather and clove. The juicy palate offers blackberry pulp and ripe blueberry, accented by a note of unsweetened black licorice."
Spain,86.0,52.0,Ribera del Duero,Cathar,"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of stewed berry, coffee grinds and compost are less than appealing, although with airing things improve. This is wide and blocky in the mouth, with ripe, raisiny, roasted black-fruit flavors matched by bitter espresso. Molasses and heat drive the finish on this pricey wine that's not in great shape."
Spain,84.0,7.0,Alicante,Bocopa,"With a light tan color and yeasty, briny aromas of vanilla and nectarine, this blend of Macabeo (Viura) and the obscure Merseguera grape delivers a wet, simple palate with citric and malic acid. Pithy citrus flavors of grapefruit and tangerine finish long for a basic, unoaked wine."
US,84.0,18.0,Sonoma County,Simi,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors."
US,94.0,35.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Terre Rouge,"Hang onto your hat; here's a very great Syrah. The aromas are hiding, now suggesting plum and blackberry, now black pepper, now freshly baked rhubarb pie. In the mouth, it knocks out with grace and power. It's soft as silk, but complex and layered, and the richly tannic finish suggests aging potential. Not too long, though."
Spain,89.0,147.0,Rioja,Contino,"Put this wine through its paces and see if you also find overdone oak and salty resin as well as tangy but bulky fruit, herbal hints and bouncy acidity. It gets better with airing, which leads us to believe that this wine's best days are still ahead of it."
France,90.0,18.0,JuranÃ§on,Domaine CauhapÃ©,"Harvested at the end of October, this gently sweet wine has hints of botrytis along with ripe apricot and honey flavors. It is shot through with delicious acidity that gives the wine a great lift and final freshness."
Spain,87.0,18.0,Cava,Sumarroca,"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor."
Italy,96.0,97.0,Barolo,Massolino,"Firmly structured and loaded with energy, this intense red opens with aromas of new leather, pipe tobacco, eucalyptus and a whiff of cake spice. The aromas carry over to the vibrant palate along with raspberry and cherry set against a firm backbone of assertive but refined tannins. Tightly wound and youthfully austere, it still needs time but seems destined to blossom into a beauty. Drink 2025??043."
France,86.0,12.0,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,"Attractive cherry flavors give a ripe, rounded feel that's balanced by the acidity and tannins. Black cherries burst easily from the glass, delivering a full aftertaste."
US,93.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gramercy,"The aromas are brooding, with notes of red fruit, plum, assorted herbs and high-toned spices. The red fruit flavors are pure and layered, bringing a whole lot of hedonistic pleasure while showing exquisite balance."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,Col Vetoraz Spumanti,"Soapy lavender and floral tones are followed by loads of citrus fruit. This is a perky, lively sparkler with a sharp point of acidity on the close and a determined, linear personality. Pair it with spicy finger foods."
US,91.0,19.0,Santa Barbara County,Longoria,"Longoria brings a deft touch to this Pinot Grigio. The grapes were briefly fermented in tank, then bottled when the wine was only about four months old. The result is exceptionally fresh and lively, with tangy acidity brightening citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and white pepper flavors."
France,89.0,16.0,Alsace,Dopff Au Moulin,"Gentle fruit notes of creamy citrus signal a restrained style. The palate is a mix of peachy, juicy richness and mandarin-peel freshness. This is a mild, off dry, gently perfumed and balanced wine."
France,92.0,55.0,Sancerre,Saget la PerriÃ¨re,"From one of the top vineyard sites in Sancerre, this fine wine is ripe, herby and intense. It has concentrated white fruits, citrus and green herbs. There is a distinct tangy minerality that will soften over the next few months. Drink from early 2018."
France,89.0,22.0,JuliÃ©nas,Clos de Haute-Combe,"An attractively fruity wine, this is rich in cherry and light spice flavors and is laden with acidity. It has a dry set of tannins, but it is so densely juicy that it is ready to drink now."
France,88.0,15.0,Touraine,Paris-Simoneau,"This is a honey and almond-flavored wine. With its light acidity and creamed-apple fruitiness, it is soft with a crisp edge. Drink this attractive sparkling wine now."
US,82.0,25.0,Southern Oregon,Cliff Creek,"Earthy and thin, this has little in the way of fruit flavor or varietal character. Stemmy tannins and sour acids leave an impression of a dilute, unripe wine."
US,85.0,10.0,California,One Leaf,"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture."
Italy,92.0,90.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fattoria dei Barbi,"This brunello offers a pretty bouquet, showing elegance and restraint at the same time. There are layers of small berry fruit, spice and leather, with dusty, dry tannins. The wine's overall astringency should soften with time."
US,89.0,40.0,North Fork of Long Island,Bedell,Hints of wild game and ceder lend rusticity to tart red-currant notes on this elegant Cabernet Franc. It's delicate in body but densely concentrated in red cherry and cassis flavors that penetrate. Finishes boldly with a mouth-filling fringe of tannins.
France,93.0,39.0,JuranÃ§on,Domaine Coustarret,"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of JuranÃ§on, in the foothills of the PyrÃ©nÃ©es mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste SÃ©bastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019."
France,87.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau RÃ©al Martin,"A caramel- and lemon-flavored wine that's both fresh and soft. It has an attractive perfumed character and a warm and round texture. This is made from old vines, which lends it extra concentration."
France,89.0,43.0,Saint-Aubin,Au Pied du Mont Chauve,"Bright and fruity, this wine has a warm, ripe streak that gives it richness. It also has all the freshness and crispness of the vintage while showing a more creamy character that's typical of Saint-Aubin. It is developing quickly and could well be ready to drink in 2016, certainly by 2017."
US,88.0,21.0,Amador County,Andis,"This is made in an unusually light and refreshing style, using grapes from 37-year-old vines. It has aromas and flavors like white pepper, snap peas and lemon, light body and crisp acidity. The overall impression is one of freshness and brightness."
US,89.0,39.0,Santa Barbara County,La FenÃªtre,"This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity. Seems best now and for a year or two."
France,86.0,19.0,Bourgogne,Nuiton-Beaunoy,"A rounded wine, benefiting from the fruitiness of the year to give soft tannins, ripe strawberry fruits and an attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although could age a few months."
Italy,87.0,11.0,Collio,CormÃ²ns,"This bright, savory wine offers yellow peach, citrus and green melon sensations accented with a light almond note. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing, clean finish."
Australia,93.0,70.0,Barossa Valley,Kilikanoon,"Full bodied and rich, with extravagant mint, chocolate, cassis, coffee and cedar notes that come close to going over the top, kept in check by muscular tannins that impart the texture of fine powder to the wine's lengthy finish. Drink 2012??020."
US,92.0,28.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity."
US,91.0,38.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"This 100% varietal wine is appealing with aromas of coffee, toasty barrel spices, berry and red fruit. It displays good richness and depth, offering plenty of pleasure now but clearly keeping an eye on the future. Best after 2018."
US,93.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Zeitgeist,"From old vines within the Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this is a rare bottling of a variety more commonly found in the Jura, but acquiring new fans in California, especially made at this high level. Creamy and round, it remains fresh on the palate in a lemon-swirled minerality that provides a savory edge of ginger."
US,90.0,60.0,Finger Lakes,Bloomer Creek,"Curious hints of candied citrus peel, dried fig and apricot abound in this exotically spiced Riesling. Laced with honey and sweet apple flavors, it's off dry in style, yet impeccably balanced by a strike of spine-tingling acidity. While deft and dainty in mouthfeel, it finishes on a lingering cardamom note."
US,89.0,31.0,Paso Robles,Le Vigne,"Savory touches of herb-crusted poultry, leather and turned earth show on the nose of this bottling from East Paso. Dried red fruit, rich leather and smoked pork elements and a touch of coffee on the finish show on the palate, where the tannins are a touch firm right now."
Australia,93.0,33.0,Barossa Valley,Lambert,"Scents of vanilla and baking spices frame bold raspberry fruit on the nose, while the flavors take a more savory turn, toward mocha and grilled meat. This is full bodied and maybe even a touch warm, but it works, ending long and plush. Drink now??025."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Morellino di Scansano,Suberli,"Earthy aromas of underbrush, sunbaked soil, pressed violet and dried rosemary meld together with whiffs of espresso. The firm palate offers dried Marasca cherry, cranberry, star anise and a gamy note alongside close-grained tannins."
US,87.0,12.0,Sonoma County,Cline,"This Syrah is somewhat tough and gritty in tannins, with a bite of acidity. It's very dry, with flavors of tobacco, herbs, blackberries and cola. A good, sound full-bodied red for drinking now."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Forest Glen,"Fruity, clean, and on the sweet side, this is an everyday quaffer whose sugary flavors are just fine for a sunny afternoon with ripe peaches or apricots. ItÃs Cailfornia soft, a country style wine that will appeal to those who find some whites tart or sour."
Italy,93.0,56.0,Toscana,Tenuta San Guido,"Fragrant, fresh and loaded with finesse, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot opens with scents of fragrant blue flowers, perfumed berry and a whiff of pine forest. The bright, silky palate delivers crunchy red currants, juicy raspberries and white pepper. It's nicely balanced, with firm, polished tannins and lively acidity. Drink 2016??022."
France,90.0,68.0,Ladoix,Louis Max,"This wine has a mineral texture, cool and crisp. It is packed with citrus and green-apple flavors that give a bright, tight character. At the end, the vanilla flavor from wood aging comes through. Drink from 2019."
France,86.0,20.0,Menetou-Salon,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"Lightly herbal in character, this is a very fresh, very fruity wine. Green vegetable flavors are balanced by intense acidity and a tight, crisp minerality. Drink from 2016."
France,93.0,108.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Famille Perrin,"This wine takes white ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape to rare heights. Mouthwatering aromas of toasted nuts and pineapple set the stage for a full-bodied, rich, succulent wine experience whose finish lingers. Yet despite the wine's undeniable heft, it never seems overly weighty. Drink this blend of 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc over the next couple of years."
US,87.0,26.0,Santa Clara Valley,Jason-Stephens,"This has smooth tannins and plenty of bright fruit flavor. Made in a savory style, the finish on this wine has a leathery bite to it."
US,82.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Gustafson Family,"Blended with 10% Petite Sirah, this wine has a stewed quality that makes it seem overdone, with only the slightest suggestion of fruit and spice."
France,92.0,75.0,Beaune,Louis Jadot,"This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years."
US,92.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton Estate,"This wine saw no oak barrel aging, but it's so rich and satisfyingly clean, it's probably better off not being weighed down by caramel and buttered toast. Brimming with brisk acidity, it shows brilliantly pure citrus fruit, tart gooseberry, Asian pear, green apple, mineral and white pepper flavors. The vineyard is in Green Valley."
Spain,92.0,25.0,Jerez,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,"Loaded with power, this wine's nose is nutty and creamy, with caramel and popcorn aromas. This feels lively, but also rich and layered. Flavors of buttered toast, caramel, toffee and walnut lead into finishing accents of cocoa, caramel and salty buttered popcorn."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Collio,Ca'Ronesca,"This offers aromas that recall acacia honey, pressed flower and beeswax. The mature, evolved palate shows candied citrus zest, toasted nut and bread crust while a mineral note closes the finish."
Argentina,87.0,20.0,Mendoza,Ricardo Santos,"Berry aromas with subtle spice accents are damp and soothing. In the mouth, this is the opposite: All dry tannins and rawness. Hard-driving black-fruit flavors pull up short on a peppery finish. It's an honest but rough wine."
US,81.0,20.0,Iowa,Jasper,"Anyone who doesn't like barnyard smells will want to steer clear of this funky example from Iowa. The crisp palate shows some cherry notes and little tannin. Finishes with some oily, ashy notes."
Spain,87.0,18.0,Jerez,Osborne,"Caramel and maple aromas are welcoming and fresh but not sophisticated. This has a simple mouthfeel along with flavors of coffee, mocha and chocolate. A nutty, short finish is smooth and tasty but devoid of complexity."
Australia,85.0,13.0,South Eastern Australia,Kono BarÃº,"This is a clean and fruity Shiraz?and one that fits the Australian success formula almost predictably. Jammy blackberry and cassis fruit is framed by touches of oak-derived vanilla and spice, tannins are soft and the mouthfeel supple. It's well done, even if it lacks a certain degree of individuality."
Italy,94.0,75.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Collosorbo,"This successful riserva displays opulence and a bold, modern style that focuses on bright cherry and savory spice aromas. The wine is loaded with density and richness, and combines a ripe soft feel with a lively berries on the finish."
US,85.0,26.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Martinez & Martinez,"The aromas of vanilla, herb and cherry show some volatility. The cherry flavors are light, finishing tart."
US,92.0,75.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it. Drily balanced and elegantly constructed, it brims with rich blackberry and black currant flavors, with a fine coating of spicy oak. Best 2012??018."
US,87.0,24.0,California,Ojai,"Made in a leaner, racier style than most California Viogniers, this has mineral, tangerine and apricot flavors, with considerable acidity."
US,81.0,12.0,California,Kitchen Sink,"This blend of 43% Zinfandel, 30% Syrah, 20% Merlot, 6% Petite Sirah and 1% ?other,??this is overly acidic and watery, with thin fruit flavors."
US,98.0,250.0,St. Helena,Alpha Omega,"From one of the warmest sites in the grower's stable, this barrel-fermented, 100% varietal wine is beguiling in its complete embrace of ripe, supple sunshine. A grip of oak tannin helps support the exuberant, juicy, dark blue fruit, further defined by its soft texture and underlying, focused acidity."
US,92.0,22.0,Monterey County,Le P'tit Paysan,"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time."
Argentina,86.0,40.0,Mendoza,Zolo,Baked raisiny aromas are dominant and suggest overripeness. A heavy palate is rich but lacks flow and ease. Baked berry and raisin flavors are tasty but by now it's obvious that this lacks finesse and is off balance.
US,93.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,Bailarin,"This new brand from the folks behind Suacci Carciere is a study in cool-climate austerity and elegance. A tangle of savory herb and Asian spice seasons soft, lean layers of strawberry and pomegranate. Bright and full of verve, it's a food-friendly, complex wine from a producer worth watching."
US,93.0,110.0,St. Helena,Stone The Crows,"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape."
US,85.0,25.0,Lake Michigan Shore,Wyncroft,"This Chardonnay pays homage to the winemaker's wife and business partner, Rae Lee, who unfortunately passed away from breast cancer in 2009. This is an enjoyable showing, displaying lemon and peach tones over a core of creamed corn. Having spent six months in neutral French oak, the palate shows a bit of breadth, balanced by lively acidity."
US,87.0,28.0,Oregon,Obsidian,"Purple and plum in color, this delivers plummy fruit and graphite, or charcoal dust, in the tannins. It's bone dry and straightforward, clean and balanced."
France,93.0,75.0,Champagne,Jacquesson et Fils,"Just released, this latest non-vintage from Jacquesson is very steely, austere, cool and elegant with apple and citrus acidity. It has freshness and balance. Still young, but very complete."
US,93.0,46.0,Sonoma Coast,Zepaltas,"This light, clear wine is varietal in approach and silky texture, also offering a tension of high acidity, forest floor and nervy, cool-climate fruit. From a vineyard overlooking Freestone, it speaks to site and taste with classy effectiveness."
US,95.0,125.0,Rutherford,Amici,"Another successful Cabernet from Amici, who turns to this esteemed vineyard for sourcing. It shows real pedigree and finesse, and it's instantly appealing for its soft tannins and complex cherry, red currant, cocoa and spice flavors. Yes, it's expensive, but it's Amici's best Cabernet of the vintage, and this is as upscale as Napa Cabernet gets."
US,84.0,14.0,Atlas Peak,Cameron Hughes,"This simple Chardonnay delivers with buttered toast, butterscotch and pineapple-orange-mango juice flavors. It's on the soft side."
US,91.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Argyle,"Principally Pinot Noir, the blend includes 25% Pinot Meunier and a splash of Chardonnay. It's a light and pretty salmon pink in hue, with hints of honeysuckle and moist earth in the nose. Flavors suggest tart raspberries and Bing cherries, with impressive minerality in the crisp, lingering finish."
US,90.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Vinum Ferus,"Quite tart, in a bracing, food friendly way, this foot-stomped rosÃ© brings pretty notes of crushed roses and sweet cherries to the fore. There's impressive body and length, with a lick of citrus extending the finish."
US,94.0,135.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"Profile has been an important, but sometimes overlooked, member of the Napa Valley pantheon for many years, and their '06 shows why. It's a rich, complex and smooth wine. Packed with blackberry, cassis and smoky, new oak flavors, it shows a firm structure of tannins and acidity. Beautiful now with a grilled steak, and should age well for at least a decade."
France,92.0,220.0,BÃ¢tard-Montrachet,Louis Latour,"Not for the fainthearted, this is a huge, mouthfilling wine bursting with yellow plum, hazelnut and peach aromas, and accented by smoke, butter and toast. Yet for all its size, it manages to marry that power with a sense of mineral elegance. Drink now??010."
France,90.0,42.0,Crozes-Hermitage,Fayolle Fils & Fille,"Ãlevage in one-third new oak has imparted toast, vanilla and cedar aromas and given the texture of this wine a plush edge, but the quality of the underlying fruit and the length of the finish are undeniable. The primary blackberry fruit should develop hints of coffee and black olive in short order; drink 2013??019."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Toscana,Tommasi,"Black currants and green bell pepper aromas lead the nose on this easygoing Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany. The soft, straightforward palate offers plum and black cherry with a hint of licorice alongside round tannins. Not an ager so enjoy soon for the best of the juicy fruit flavors."
Spain,88.0,20.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Quinta Couselo,"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid. Normally AlbariÃ±o is a one-year wine, meaning you should drink it in the year immediately after harvest. Here's an '05 that's hanging in there and still showing kick. Drink now for best results."
France,85.0,25.0,MÃ¢con-Pierreclos,Domaine Marc Jambon,"A rounded wine that is soft and fruity, the flavors edged with toast. There is an attractive citrus flavor that gives some crispness to what feels a fat wine. Drink now."
France,83.0,13.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bellevue la RandÃ©e,"Tannins mask the light fruitiness in this blend of 45% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. It seems extracted, with the producer attempting to get too much out of the fruit in a lean year."
US,88.0,90.0,Rutherford,Conn Creek,"Mild with raspberry flavor and soft, integrated oak and tannin, this full-bodied wine is comprised entirely of Cabernet Sauvignon and imparts a characteristic Rutherford dustiness on the palate."
Spain,88.0,24.0,Ribeira Sacra,Don Bernardino,"This blend of MencÃ­a, the local Grand Noir and Merenzao opens with raisiny, spicy, slightly baked aromas that suggest nutmeg. The palate is drawing and hard, with earthy, slightly cooked flavors of cherry and kirsch that end with a dash of lemony oak."
US,89.0,65.0,Rutherford,St. SupÃ©ry,"Cedar dust, dried herb, currant and graphite combine effortlessly in this restrained wine, subtle in buried tannin. It shows voluptuous body with moderate acidity and a ripeness on the finish."
US,92.0,20.0,North Fork of Long Island,Anthony Nappa,"A standout amid a number of excellent red wines from winemaker Anthony Nappa, this unoaked Cabernet Franc (made with indigenous yeast) shines a spotlight on Cabernet Franc's raw, somewhat vulnerable expression. It's unabashedly herbal and green, almost minty, yet simultaneously luscious and berried in flavor. It's fleshy in its suppleness, yet elegantly framed within a structure of taut tannins and acidity."
US,92.0,37.0,Dry Creek Valley,Ottimino Vineyards,"From a dry-farmed vineyard planted more than 50 years ago, this 100% varietal wine is highlighted in compost, leather and graphite. Well structured, with firm, strong tannins, it offers a tartness of pomegranate and black cherry along with a complexity of savory tobacco leaf."
France,86.0,14.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau des Combes,"Benefiting from the ripe 2009 fruit, this shows the attractive character of many value Bordeaux wines in this year. It has red plum fruits, touched with raisins along with toast, acidity and a balance of tannins."
Italy,87.0,42.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Basilisco,"Tobacco, toast, French oak and cured meat aromas lead the nose. The rather lean palate offers dried cherry, licorice, oak-driven spice and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Grainy tannins leave a mouth-drying finish."
Spain,85.0,24.0,Ribera del Duero,MarquÃ©s de ValparaÃ­so,"Raw, green aromas suggest underripe fruit, green tobacco and green herbs. Following the nose, this feels astringent and clampy. Herbal flavors of plum don't taste as green as this smells, while the finish is rugged and tannic."
US,90.0,24.0,Napa Valley,Napa Cellars,"Minty menthol surrounds red currant and berry in this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Savory black pepper dots a tightly structured texture and weight that mellows appropriately on the finish."
Australia,86.0,13.0,South Eastern Australia,Tall Poppy,"On the same quality level as its wooded counterpart, this Chardonnay shows modestly intense aromas, but plenty of pear and melon flavor. Easy to drink."
Italy,90.0,77.0,Toscana,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,"Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese and a drop of Petit Verdot, this has aromas of stewed plum, exotic spice, raisin, purple flower and a balsamic note. The concentrated palate offers cassis, dried blackberry, oak-driven spice, bitter cocoa and espresso alongside close-grained tannins that leave a firm grippy finish."
US,90.0,45.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ojai,"Too young now, a tight wine whose oak, acidity, alcohol and fruit are all over the place. The cherry, currant, cola, beef jerky and Asian spice flavors are quite intricate and delicious. There's a dry, elegant wine in here that's just waiting to bust out and come together after 4?? years in a good cellar."
US,85.0,9.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Covey Run,"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort."
France,88.0,18.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Sauvion,"The vines around the showpiece castle of ClÃ©ray have produced a crisp, lemon-scented wine that has a tight mineral edge to point up the ripe apple and lime fruitiness. Drink now."
France,94.0,135.0,Saint-Julien,ChÃ¢teau Ducru Beaucaillou,"Despite the huge weight of fruit and accompanying structure, this is a stylish wine. It's impressively dense, concentrated and solid. At the same time, the juicy black fruits give a generous, full-in-the-mouth character. Drink this very fine wine from 2022."
US,85.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Hendry,"This is a no-holds-barred wine. It's like Zinfandel on steroids, with explosive flavors of sweet raspberry, cherry and chocolate-covered raisin. The alcohol gives the wine a Port-like heat."
US,87.0,50.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Carr,"Very tough and tannic now, and dry too, so that the ultimate impact is disagreeably harsh. That, despite a solid core of blackberries, black currants, violets, bacon and minerals. The question is one of ageability. The answer is that it's a gamble, as the wine, like the stock market, could go either way."
Argentina,86.0,11.0,Mendoza,Black Cabra,"Aromas of blackberry and prune are earthy, warm and cheesy. This feels heavy and syrupy but not out of whack. Roasted, blackened flavors of grapy berry fruits finish with mint, clove and peppery notes."
US,84.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"It show the vintage's weakness, with a vegetal edge to the cherries and oak."
US,93.0,50.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based ode to Pauillac improves immensely as it sits open for days, suggesting great ageability. Black currant, gravel, teriyaki and dark chocolate show on the nose, leading into a palate that is tightly wound with chalky tannins. Flavors of black fruit, charcoal, pencil shavings and coffee slowly emerge. Drink 2019??033."
US,91.0,38.0,Wahluke Slope,Fielding Hills,"An aromatically brooding wine with notes of cherry, black pepper and barrel spices. It's full bodied with rich flavors and a cranberry lick on the finish."
Spain,90.0,40.0,Jumilla,Bodegas Murtia,"This is living proof that Jumilla's Monastrells can age well. Earthy aromas of plum, blackberry and vanilla are oaky but mature and true to the region and variety. This feels vital and balanced, supported by mature, chewy tannins. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate finish long, with energy to spare. Drink now through 2018."
US,85.0,20.0,California,Scott Harvey,"Grassy, minty aromas, a juicy texture and tart cherry flavors add up to a medium-bodied, uncomplicated wine with good balance."
Spain,89.0,20.0,Ribera del Duero,SeÃ±orÃ­o de Sotillo,"Tight, woody scents accent core plum aromas on this nicely balanced crianza. A fresh snap of acidity keeps weighty fruit and oak tannins in check, while raspberry, plum, pepper and bitter espresso flavors roll onto a seamless finish with black pepper and additional bitter notes."
France,87.0,75.0,Champagne,G. H. Mumm,"Orange-pink in color, this is a fruity while mature wine. It has ripe red berry flavors along with a bitter cherry character that introduces a touch of tannin. The acidity and the crisp aftertaste make for an attractive finish."
US,94.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,Black Kite,"More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense. Mouth filling in its juicy red and blue fruit flavor, it's silky and entirely seductive. Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5?? years."
Argentina,90.0,46.0,Perdriel,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way. Heavily toasted and creamy on the palate, this hefty full-bodied Chardonnay tastes of wood resin, spiced apple and peach. Solid acidity keep this in line, while a lasting wave of toasty oak pushes the finish."
France,87.0,12.0,Vin de France,L. Tramier & Fils,"Based in Burgundy, Tramier should know something about Chardonnay. This wine has some structure that tastes of cool vineyards. It is crisp, with refreshing white fruit and green-plum flavors, and is ready to drink."
France,88.0,11.0,CorbiÃ¨res,Domaine LignÃ¨res,"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish."
US,86.0,18.0,Yolo County,Midsummer Cellars,"A gorgeously salmon-colored rosÃ© made predominantly from Grenache (62%) co-fermented dry with Viognier (58%) out of Yolo County. The wine has a delicately pretty nose of peach and a light-medium body despite its 14.8% alcohol, though the finish falls off fast."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Rubicone,Umberto Cesari,There's a soft and plush side to this edition of Moma that comes forward thanks to the extra cinnamon spice and vanilla present on the bouquet. Red berry fruit and cherry add a note of freshness to the finish.
US,90.0,56.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton Estate,"This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate. Black tea and rose garden dance around highlights of orange and cranberry, the wine tart in mineralogy, as well as full of length and density."
US,91.0,32.0,Carneros,Roessler,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle citrus fruit and floral flavors, this Chardonnay suggests Chablis as its model. The elegant structure is likeable. If you're a fan of big fruit, it's not for you, but it's quite a classy Chardonnay. Good with cracked crab with drawn butter and buttered sourdough bread."
France,90.0,38.0,Fixin,Alex Gambal,"From a small vineyard in the north of the CÃ´te de Nuits, this is a rare white wine in a red-wine region. Lightly toasty, it has spice, pear flavors and perfumed acidity. It's bright and crisp, ending with lively acidity."
US,88.0,40.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bargetto,"This wine displays the aggressive acidity typical of Central Coast Merlots. While it's rich and dry in raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a fine note of smoky oak, the tartness is central. Pairing this with ham will help tame the acids."
US,87.0,70.0,Willamette Valley,Patton Valley,"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve-level bottling, and gets the most new oak, about 60%. In this vintage, the fruit seems a bit thin, almost watery, although with some hours of breathing it gains some palate traction. It's well made, but don't look for reserve-level heft."
US,95.0,140.0,Diamond Mountain District,Summers,"This is easily one of the most delicious Cabernets of the year. The first sip dazzles, offering a treasure chest of flavors, including blackberry, spice, mocha and toasted oak. For all the richness, the wine is properly dry, and the tannins are as smooth as old silk. It's so approachable, it's hard to believe it's from Diamond Mountain, whose tannins are notoriously hard in youth. The one drawback is that the wine is too soft for aging, but who cares? Drink now??015."
Australia,84.0,17.0,Orange,Logan Australia,"Shows promise in its lightly toasty and citrusy aromas and lemon and green-apple flavors, but tails off rapidly on the finish. It's lean and racy, obviously from a relatively cool-climate region, and should be served as you would basic Chablis, with oysters and the like."
US,89.0,35.0,Contra Costa County,Neyers,"A rare treat from a 120-year-old vineyard, this wine has a dark color, generous aromas and concentrated but dry fruit flavors. It will make a great pairing for robust, rich foods due to its medium body, lean mouthfeel and sturdy support from fine-grained tannins."
US,88.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,La Crema,"Attractive for its rich creaminess, this Chard aims for the popular style and succeeds. It's soft and rich in orange, peach, apricot and mango fruit, with sweet-oak overtones of vanilla and buttered toast."
France,88.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau l'Afrique,"Crisp and fruity, this is a classic rosÃ©. It shows a lightness that comes from the delicately handled fruits, giving gentle berry flavors, bright acidity and a textured aftertaste."
US,85.0,13.0,Finger Lakes,Wagner,"On the nose, this is a bit unique, offering unusual scents of pineapple, baked apple and white florals. Just slightly off-dry with loads of sweet, fresh apple flavors and a brisk, lemony acidity, the finish ends on an elegant jasmine tea note."
US,87.0,28.0,Southern Oregon,Sweet Cheeks,"The aromatics immediately catch your attention: an inviting mix of raspberry and tart citrus. The wine is tightly focused, with crisp edges around wild-berry flavors. Just a tiny hint of bloody beef moves it toward more Northern RhÃ´ne Syrah flavors."
US,89.0,65.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Alleromb,"Light in color, this wine brings brooding aromas of red fruit, herb, spice and tire rubber. The red-fruit flavors are light and elegant, pulling up toward the finish."
US,88.0,12.0,Clarksburg,Sand Point,"Spicy, minty aromas and rich flavors like dark chocolate and black cherries add up to a bold, full-bodied wine from the Lange Twins. It has a deep color, moderate tannins to add grip to the texture and a lingering finish."
Spain,90.0,27.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Adegas Gran Vinum,"This is a particular style of AlbariÃ±o. Aromas of white flowers distant mineral and green melon set up a plump, layered palate, with core acidity but also flatness that will only increase the longer it goes. Flavors of nectarine, orange and melon register as citric but also creamy. This is a unique Galician white that's stylish but won't last forever; drink immediately."
US,90.0,38.0,Alexander Valley,Wattle Creek,"This is smooth and sweet-tasting, with dark chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and smoky oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. The tannins are strong, just what you'd expect from Malbec, making this a great partner for steak."
US,88.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Va Piano Bruno's Blend II,"This is actually a 2010 wine, but for consistency it is not labeled with the vintage. Fragrant and floral, with the addition of 5% Riesling contributing a pleasing orange blossom/orange peel accent. Overall, it's refreshing and succulent, a juicy mix of citrus fruits and balanced acids."
US,87.0,15.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Santa Barbara Winery,"Delicious flavors of lemons, limes, tangerines and honey in this wine, with notes of flowers and steel. It's also very acidic and off dry. A simple Riesling, but a clean and attractive one."
Italy,85.0,18.0,Prosecco del Veneto,Casalnova,"The nose of this luminous sparkler focuses on honey, acacia flower and a hint of almond nut. The bubbling is steady and direct, leaving soda-like effervescence in the mouth with little creaminess."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Monte del FrÃ ,"This is a structured but elegant wine, with attractive aromas of baked plum, black cherry and cinnamon. The palate is both concentrated and smooth, with lush blackberry, white pepper and cinnamon flavors, as well as fresh acidity. This is delicious and ready to enjoy now."
US,85.0,28.0,Paso Robles,Graveyard,"Gamy aromas of rare beef and raw lamb show on the nose of this bottling, with black peppercorn, teriyaki and a touch of caramel. The flavors are a bit primary, with Concord grape jelly, blueberry jam and candied lilac, as well as a vanilla-bean oakiness."
France,87.0,40.0,Champagne,Marie Copinet,"This wine, blending one-third each of the three main Champagne grapes, is crisp, although with a dosage that gives it a soft edge. Full of ripe apple and warm melon fruit, it has acidity as well as a gentle texture. The wine is balanced and ready to drink."
US,88.0,15.0,Oregon,Eola Hills,"Here is a good all-purpose and widely available Oregon Pinot Gris. It's got classic pear and apple fruit flavors, well balanced against tangy acidity. There's no oak here, but the whole cluster press brings some spicy phenolics."
Italy,86.0,10.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico,Umani Ronchi,"Crisp and refreshing aromas suggest white wildflower and pear. The bright, easygoing palate delivers crunchy green apple, nectarine zest and a light almond note alongside vibrant acidity."
Spain,85.0,10.0,Somontano,Bodegas Pirineos,"Rugged and roasted on the bouquet, with rubbery blackberry and freshly laid tar aromas. It feels big and solid, but simple, with raspberry, strawberry and a hint of green herb on the palate. The finish is mild tasting, with a cocoa note."
US,92.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Krupp Brothers,"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky."
US,91.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Vina Robles,"Fresh-squeezed apple juice, grapefruit spritzer and nearly sweet cherry aromas sit atop minerality on the nose of this blend of 46% Viognier, 19% Verdelho, 19% Vermentino and 16% Sauvignon Blanc. There's a lot of tart acidity, with a lingering apple flavor."
US,87.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Martin Ray,"Lots of buttered toast and butterscotch flavors mark this Chardonnay. It's balanced, however, with crisp acidity and bright flavors of tropical fruit and peach, along with a fragrant honeysuckle note."
Italy,85.0,16.0,Prosecco di Conegliano,L'Antica Quercia,Sweet spring flowers and citrus highlights characterize this generous Prosecco Brut with creamy effervescence and mature peach flavors. The perky sparkler has a drying finish with lingering mineral tones.
Italy,90.0,60.0,Toscana,I Giusti e Zanza,"Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this deeply colored wine offers aromas black plum, dried cherry and clove. The round, ripe palate doles out mature black cherry, blackberry, licorice and black pepper alongside firm, chewy tannins."
US,86.0,12.0,Willamette Valley,Duck Pond,"Right out of the chute this is a fresh, lively with scented with fresh cut pears. It's balanced and crisp, with subtle hints of cinnamon spice. A good spring/summer quaffer."
US,91.0,26.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Delicious peach and pear flavors light up this full-bodied, soft and well-rounded wine. It has fresh floral aromas and nicely ripe fruit notes on the palate, with a smooth, graceful texture and beautiful, lingering finish."
US,90.0,32.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Longoria,"This low production blend of Longoria's estate Fe Ciega Vineyard and Bien Nacido Vineyard seems to be comprised of grapes that didn't make the winery's highest cut. It's quite a nice wine, dry, brisk and pure in cherries, cola, spices and sandalwood, but it doesn't seem like an ager, so enjoy now."
US,86.0,21.0,Oregon,Merrill Cellars,"This G-S-M blend is solid and flavorful, with mixed berry flavors and an underpinning of graphite. The tannins are drying, on the edge of being chalky."
Australia,89.0,40.0,McLaren Vale,Kay Brothers,"Earthy and tarry at first, this is a firmly structured Shiraz. Peppery notes accent blueberry and blackberry fruit along the way to a slightly abbreviated finish. Try in 2016."
Australia,92.0,50.0,Barossa,Thorn Clarke,"This luxury cuvÃ©e from Thorne Clarke combines ripe berries with cinnamon and clove, then adds dollops of vanilla and chocolate, yet never seems overly sweet. Likewise, it's full bodied and rich, yet never goes over the top, maintaining a sense of freshness and structure. Drink now??020, and possibly beyond."
US,86.0,13.0,Monterey,Bianchi,"This is a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with ethnic fare, from Mexican to Vietnamese and Ethiopian. Its acidic citrus flavors will brighten and heighten richly sauced chicken dishes, ."
France,93.0,55.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"The restrained and floral opening of jasmine and mandarin peel leads to a palate that holds just a touch of residual sugar, filling this gorgeously balanced Gewurztraminer to the brim with sweet citrus swirls of tangerine, satsuma and mandarin. Notes of orange blossom hover and are pulled into focus by the textured mouthfeel of this immensely elegant wine."
Italy,88.0,42.0,Lessini Durello,Ca' Rugate,"A blend of native grapes Durello (90%) and Garganega (10%) and made with no dosage, this opens with aromas of roasted hazelnut, lemon zest and yellow apple peel that carry over to the tangy, bone-dry palate. It has crisp acidity and finishes on a note of toasted walnut."
Italy,94.0,100.0,Barolo,Castello di Verduno,"Powerfully built, this opens with a potpourri of aromas including pressed rose, violet, mature berry, baking spice and a whiff of leather. Dried black cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco, nutmeg and a balsamic note wrap around the gripping palate alongside a backbone of ripe, assertive tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020??032."
Italy,85.0,12.0,Toscana,Buccia Nera,"A blend of Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto, Donna Patrizia is a well-price, informal wine that could pair with grilled eggplant purÃ©e and fried pita wedges. Aromas include pineapple, melon and grapefruit."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Cordella,"Opens with a sweet opulent nose driven by aromas of plump cherry, moist pipe tobacco, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and ground espresso. But the wine is not modern or overtly international in terms of its style. It shows deep roots in Montalcino tradition and a bold, overt personality. Earth, leather and dried tobacco drive the finish."
Italy,89.0,48.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Podere Paganico,"This offers mature black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. The palate is ripe yet firm, delivering prune, mocha and clove clove flavors blanketed in chewy tannins. Drink 2018??023."
France,87.0,25.0,Sancerre,JÃ©rÃ´me Gueneau,"The wine is soft with a lightly toasty character to go alongside the bright acidity. Its grapefruit and gooseberry flavors are right up front, giving a fruity aspect to the steely texture. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,25.0,Sonoma County,St. Francis,"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo."
US,90.0,25.0,Lodi,Klinker Brick,"Full bodied, complex, oaky and concentrated, this wine has a broad palette of flavors from spicy cinnamon-like oak shadings to ripe blueberry and dark chocolate. The texture is appropriately and moderately tannic."
US,92.0,38.0,Anderson Valley,On Point,"This fascinating medium-bodied wine has a wild streak that first brings rhubarb and forest-floor aromas, then deep dark flavor nuances like mushroom, black cherry and more tangy rhubarb. It has good acidity and fine-grained tannins to support all that complexity. It offers all the complexity one looks for in a Pinot."
US,90.0,22.0,Lake Chelan,Hard Row To Hoe,"Made from 100% Sangiovese, grown on the shores of Lake Chelan, one of Washington's newest and smallest AVAs. The extra year in bottle has softened and opened the aromas, which bring exceptional complexity to what might appear to be a more simple wine. Not just fruity, though there is plenty of tangy strawberry nectar, along with hints of orange peel and chai tea. The complexity here is remarkable."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Navarra,Zorzal,"This smells strange, with a mix of herbal blueberry, leather and green tobacco aromas. An awkward, fiercely tannic palate leads to herbal, minty flavors of boysenberry and blackberry that finish with dry, abrasive tannins."
Spain,93.0,30.0,Ribera del Duero,Montecastro,"Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016??030."
US,93.0,38.0,Ballard Canyon,Seal Beach,"This winery, with its Los Alamitos tasting room east of Long Beach, sources from a variety of vineyards to make some impressive wines. This bottling shows crushed black pepper, tar, roasted lamb and savory herb notes on the nose. The palate is tangy with underripe boysenberry, thyme, black tea and roasted lamb flavors."
US,90.0,50.0,Virginia,Barboursville Vineyards,"This Octagon is dark and charred smelling, with aromas of blackberry, cocoa, savory spice and cherry. The palate is tight yet finessed, bearing vigorous yet manageable tannins that should eventually fade with time to reveal a charming wine. Flavors of graphite, fines herbes and coffee grounds add interest to the finish."
France,89.0,26.0,CrÃ©mant de Jura,Domaine Rolet PÃ¨re et Fils,"With light flavors of ripe red fruits balanced by fresh acidity, this rosÃ© sparkler is full in the mouth and deliciously fruity. A lively mousse gives lift to the fresh aftertaste."
US,85.0,23.0,California,Bota Box,"This full-bodied wine has an earthy, smoky aroma, an abundance of fresh grapy flavors and a soft but supportive texture. The aroma is pretty strong, and then the otherwise-generous fruit characteristics take over."
France,84.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau de ParenchÃ¨re,"Very fruity, this is a crisp, lemon-scented and flavored wine, with grassy, herbaceous character from the green Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. The aftertaste is tight with some bitterness."
US,91.0,17.0,Edna Valley,Tangent,"A beautiful white wine notable for its extreme dryness and fresh crispness of acidity. Really cleanses the mouth, letting it appreciate the unoaked flavors of tangerine, melon, peach and minerals. A brilliant wine to drink with almost anything, but especially shellfish."
US,89.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"Rich and 100% barrel fermented, this delicious Chardonnay is thick and luscious, with buttered nuts, pineapple and candied citrus; a really concentrated wine with exceptional depth and density for the price. The oak is present and accounted for, but not at all intrusive; it's really a generously fruity wine with a big mid-palate. Outstanding value."
US,90.0,39.0,Napa Valley,Tofanelli Family,"A majority varietal, a dying breed in the Napa Valley, this also has 5% Petite Sirah. The combination is dense and syrupy in strawberry and a tightness of oak. Time will soften its edges, and there's already a softness to the tannins that delights, the finish light and lean. Cellar through 2017."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Toscana,Vignaioli del Morellino di Scansano,"Made with late-ripened grapes (85% Vermentino and 15% Viognier), this has aromas suggesting beeswax, pressed yellow flower and a whiff of honey. The aromas carry over to the round palate along with suggestions of apricot and nectarine."
Italy,94.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Ruffino,"Underbrush, tobacco, new leather, crushed herb and a whiff of mature plum lead the way. The juicy full-bodied palate is still young and taut, evoking ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, clove and a hint of coffee. A backbone of youthfully austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity gives it an age-worthy structure and balance. Drink 2020??032."
US,92.0,50.0,Marin County,Hartford,"The most Burgundian of the '99s from Hartford, this cool-climate single-vineyard wine smells of leather, clove, even slightly of barnyard. Some green herbaceousness on the palate balances bright cherry fruit?the interplay of elements gives this wine a multifaceted character that changes from sip to sip. Give it 2?? years for the tannins to smooth out. Cellar Selection."
US,87.0,20.0,Oregon,Domaine Loubejac,"A nÃ©gociant effort, this was done entirely in stainless steel and neutral oak. Tart and light, it has simple strawberry fruit with a touch of spice. It offers no tricks, just straight-ahead Pinot at a modest price for Oregon."
US,93.0,32.0,Yorkville Highlands,Halcon,Mint and dill aromas turn to very concentrated and dense fruit and black-pepper flavors that unfold with extremely firm fine tannins to add a grand mouthfeel to this full-bodied wine. Time in the cellar will only improve the complexity of flavors while softening the stiff texture. Best after 2020.
Italy,87.0,30.0,Alto Adige,Alois Lageder,"The nose isn't overly expressive but eventually reveals suggestions of tropical fruit, chopped herb and a whiff of stone. The straightforward, slender palate offers grapefruit, a hint of peach and mineral accompanied by crisp acidity."
Italy,90.0,11.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,"The perfect picnic wine? Bold, floral and berry aromas, black cherry fruit, and some light tannins will make this the most versatile wine in your hamper this summer. This blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Mascalese is grown specifically for rose production--it is not a saignee used to increase the concentration of the estate's reds."
US,87.0,24.0,Russian River Valley,Sonoma CuvÃ©e,"A good, serviceable expression of a Russian River Pinot that's ready to drink now. Dry and crisp, it shows oak-infused flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and mocha."
France,93.0,95.0,Champagne,Le Brun de Neuville,"A wine that was fermented in wood before bottling, this is rich, with a definite edge of toast and spice. It is ripe with crisp fruit, although the wood has broadened the wine, giving it an attractive oxidative character. Drink this fine wine now."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Toscana,Caiarossa,"Small additions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon result in an elegant blend with measured fruit intensity and lasting impressions of blue flowers, licorice and almond paste. You can really taste the delicate Sangiovese component."
Italy,92.0,35.0,Toscana,Castello di Gabbiano,"Alleanza represents a successful collaboration between winemakers in Italy and California. The 70-30 blend consists of Merlot and Sangiovese and the wine is seductively redolent of wild berries, exotic spice, soft chocolate and mild tobacco. The plush mouthfeel wins points thanks to the smooth and silky nature of the finish."
US,87.0,25.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"This medium-bodied wine has dried herb and black olive aromas, fresh raspberry and cherry flavors that are a bit tart and a tangy balance. It's not overly big in style, but is bright and well-suited to go with a wide variety of foods."
US,91.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Mayo,"Richer and denser than Mayo?s Sangiacomo bottling, this one also seems more marked by oak, with vanilla, menthol and toast aromas all riding over black cherries. In the mouth, the fruit really comes forward; there?s impressive depth and body here, and a lushness that?s balanced by a long finish with fresh acidity. Should age for up to 5 years?maybe more. Only problem? Finding some. There were only 100 cases produced."
Italy,91.0,45.0,Toscana,Castellare di Castellina,"Sweet oak notes are followed by cherry, chocolate and vanilla. This is a rich Cabernet Sauvignon with a modern and very pleasurable approach that puts emphasis on power, softness and intensity. Vibrant cherry flavors last many long minutes on the palate."
France,89.0,49.0,Alsace,Emile Beyer,This cool wine features considerable freshness cutting the fragrant fruits. The single-vineyard site of Hohrain is next door to Pfersigberg Grand Cru. The wine is still young and showing textured mineral character. It needs several years to bring out its depth of flavor. Drink from 2017.
US,93.0,80.0,Howell Mountain,Duckhorn,"Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year."
Spain,88.0,19.0,MÃ¡laga,Jorge OrdÃ³Ã±ez & Co.,"This is friendly on the nose with a melon scent. It feels fresh and not too challenging on palate, with nectarine, peach and mango flavors. The finish isn't too firm, but it doesn't fall apart. A simple, sweet casual quaffer."
Spain,83.0,13.0,Navarra,SeÃ±orÃ­o de Sarria,"Fairly flat on the nose, and also innocuous on the palate. Flavors of green melon and nectarine are modest at best, and while the mouthfeel is decent, the overall character of the wine isn't that exciting. Finishes pithy, citric and mealy. Yet another mediocre Navarran Chardonnay."
US,85.0,29.0,California,Ardiri Winery and Vineyards,"Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture."
US,86.0,18.0,Alexander Valley,Pedroncelli,"A bit soft and heavy, but useful, with a rustic, tannic mouthfeel, and nicely dry. You'll find classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Drink now."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Valtellina Superiore,Arpepe,"Initially shy, this opens up with a few swirls of the glass to reveal underbrush, truffle, pressed rose and a balsamic note. The tense palate is lean and linear, offering tart red cherry, strawberry, clove and mineral while bright acidity and firm noble tannins provide balance. Drink 2017??022."
US,84.0,75.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Coomber Family Ranch,"There's a slightly sour smell to this offering from Coomber Family, who produce ?wines for animal lovers.??However, the sipping experience is pleasant enough, with hard cherry candy, a range of spices and a lingering licorice finish."
US,88.0,12.0,Lodi,Gnarly Head,"A deep color and ripe, gushing fruit aromas lead to generous dark cherry and blackberry flavors in this wine. Firm tannins are loosened by a sugary element that lingers on the finish."
US,93.0,45.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Saviah,"Funk Estate (60%) and Watermill vineyards?both in The Rocks District?make up this wine. It's initially aromatically brooding with high-toned notes of stems, green herbs, coffee, funk and mineral, with generous floral notes providing accents. The palate is rounded and full, with fruit and savory flavors intertwining, showing a very pretty precision. The finish is lengthy."
France,87.0,45.0,Bandol,Chateau de Pibarnon,"Hints of reduction and gamy characteristics need time to blow off, but slowly reveal elegant black fruit. The texture and structure are solid, so enjoy this wine until 2016."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Barolo,Bel Colle,"Smoky aromas, underbrush, dark berry, clove and a whiff of leather slowly emerge on this structured red. The palate displays power and finesse, delivering juicy wild cherry, white pepper, tobacco, licorice and mineral alongside assertive but refined tannins and fresh acidity. It already has depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2019??029."
Italy,90.0,60.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Lunadoro,"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of mature plum, hay, underbrush and scorched earth. The ripe, juicy palate doles out layers of black cherry, strawberry, tobacco and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. It's already enjoyable but will also age well for several years. Enjoy through 2019."
Italy,84.0,60.0,Barolo,Stroppiana,"This Barolo shows roasted coffee notes and a whisper of prune, with lots of oak on top. It's very dry, tannic and tough on the palate. Still young, but it lacks fruit flavors and balance."
US,88.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Ambassador Vineyard,"Aromas of smoke, vanilla, pencil box and green herb are followed by red fruit and medicinal flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish."
Italy,87.0,45.0,Toscana,Carpineto,"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas that recall green bell pepper, mature plum and soy sauce. The palate offers dried cherry, fig and a hint of baking spice alongside evolved, fleeting tannins. It's already extremely accessible so drink soon."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Morellino di Scansano,Morisfarms,"Morellino is a terrific red wine that is particularly food-friendly, easy-to-drink and delicious. This producer makes one of the best expressions available, characterized by bright blueberry, cherry and pulpy red fruit."
US,85.0,17.0,Dry Creek Valley,Quivira,"Dry to slightly off-dry and wonderfully crisp in acidity, this rosÃ© has spicy cherry, herb and vanilla flavors, with no oak influences at all."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Mosolo Gleni,"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck."
US,87.0,28.0,Wahluke Slope,Camaraderie,"This is a very nicely rendered Wahluke Slope AVA Syrah, with spicy currant and raspberry fruit underscored with the characteristic lightly citrusy acids. There's a hint of pineapple which resonates just beneath the surface. The wine gathers some strength in the back, adding weight and flavors of plum, cherry and chocolate."
US,85.0,10.0,California,Little Black Dress,"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value."
US,92.0,50.0,Alexander Valley,Forefathers,"This has been a very successful second label from Goldschmidt, and with this 2009, they again hit gold. The wine is smoothly tannic and dry in black cherry- pie and red currant flavors, with all kinds of interesting herb, carob bean, spice and oak complications. It's elegant and complex to drink now and over the next 5?? years."
France,89.0,52.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Daniel Rion,"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff."
France,87.0,24.0,Sancerre,JÃ©rÃ´me Gueneau,"This producer has a number of estates in Sancerre. This estate, bearing his own name, has produced a delicate, crisp and fruity wine. Its acidity and tight texture make this wine really food friendly."
Spain,90.0,24.0,Rioja,Obalo,"Dark berry aromas turn earthy and oaky. The mouthfeel on this crianza is edgy and a touch choppy, with prodding acidity. Blackberry and dark-plum flavors are subdued, while the finish is mild and healthy, but a touch abrupt. Drink through 2021."
Australia,94.0,85.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"Extraordinarily delicious is more like it. This is full bodied, supple and rich, with luscious aromas and flavors of mocha, cassis and vanilla that finish long, with some soft, dusty tannins. With all the plushness and primary fruit, it seems a little young right now; drink 2018??030."
France,90.0,24.0,Brouilly,Joseph Drouhin,"The charity Hospices of Belleville owns the land as part of its foundation, with the wines being made by Beaune negociant Joseph Drouhin. This wine is attractively fruity and soft. With its red-cherry and lightly spiced flavors, which are cut with acidity, it has a fine balanced texture, finishing with bright red-fruit acidity. Drink now."
US,85.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pezzi King,"Grippy, it has power and loads of chocolaty pepper, jammy blackberry and strawberry fruit, and a dull, toasty finish."
France,86.0,18.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud,"A simple, soft Chardonnay from the MÃ¢connais region, this is rounded. A touch of caramel adds extra flavor to the warm fruit. Green plum and melon dominate this wine that is ready to drink."
US,87.0,47.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Passaggio,"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age."
France,85.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Baron Gassier,"Overtly fruity upfront, with a green apple, pineapple, papaya and spiced orange character that trails off to a simple citrus note in the mouth. The dry, short-to-medium finish is shot through with tobacco notes. Drink up."
US,91.0,22.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Savage Grace,"This is a completely unique wine for the state, one that calls out more to the Loire Valley than to Rattlesnake Hills. Coming in at a cool 12.5% alcohol?in a vintage known for average temperatures?it brings detailed notes of flowers, cigar box, raspberry and moist earth. With nine months of neutral French-oak aging, there's barely a trace of oak influence. It's lighter in style but still brings good depth with a long, flavorful finish. As far from a cocktail wine as you can get; serve this one at the dinner table."
US,90.0,28.0,Temecula Valley,Cougar,"Finding new varietals is always fun, and this take on an ancient grape from Campania, Italy, offers promise in warm Temecula. Crisp Anjou and Asian pears show on the nose, along with salt, Gala apple, white flowers and gravel. Sharp citrus appears on the palate, with lime pith, pink-grapefruit juice and a chalky, seashell component."
France,93.0,69.0,Champagne,Hugues GodmÃ©,"This is a beautiful wine?crisp yet balanced by ripe fruit and and an equally important tight texture. With red currant flavors, intense acidity and concentration, it can be drunk now for its fresh fruit character but will be better from 2018."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Panizzi,"This is a traditional take on Vernaccia with aromas of stone fruit and almond delivered directly from the essence of the grape. There's a tiny touch of smoke or toast in the background and the mouthfeel is spicy, clean and fresh."
US,88.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Swanson,"Bright and brooding, this lightly-textured, medium-bodied wine offers smoke, leather, blackberry and baked plum. There's an underlying richness akin to decadent crÃÂ¨me anglaise, with a finish of clove and coffee."
France,90.0,11.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Bailly-Lapierre,"This is a crisp, refreshing wine. With a mousse that is lively but with a creamy edge, it offers attractive apple fruitiness. A hint of toast suggests some good bottle age. The wine finishes with a mineral, tangy aftertaste."
Spain,92.0,27.0,Ribera del Duero,Lecco,"Direct and woody on the nose, with aromas of graphite and vanilla, this opens in fine form. A tight, pure palate deftly blends weight, fine acidity and chewy tannins, while the flavor profile is earthy and blackened by charred oak, with blackberry fruit and savory, peppery spice notes. This is meaty, savory and beefy on the finish. Drink through 2021."
Australia,93.0,89.0,Margaret River,Leeuwin Estate,"As always at Leeuwin Estate, the Art Series Chardonnay is a star. Now incorporating some natural ferments and slightly more solids, the 2013 features some more savory elements than in the past. A hint of pencil shavings highlights the pear and pineapple fruit, which offers plenty of flesh without being overbearing."
Italy,87.0,39.0,RuchÃ© di Castagnole Monferrato,Montalbera,"Made predominantly from grapes that were left until they became overripe on the vine and 5% from grapes dried on wooden racks, this has aromas of nail polish remover, resin and raisin. The palate offers prune, dried black cherry, medicinal herb and hint of orange peel alongside hearty tannins."
US,87.0,49.0,Sonoma Coast,Kasuari,"Right now this Pinot is a bit heavy and full-bodied, almost like a RhÃ´ne-style wine with its thick mouthfeel and cherry, anise and chocolate flavors. It could easily age, throwing some sediment and becoming softer and more delicate. Try after 2012."
Argentina,83.0,10.0,Mendoza,Sur de los Andes,"Concentrated and intense, but typical of Bonarda this is a fierce wine with a rock-hard mouthfeel and slightly tart, limited raspberry flavors. Not exactly sour but it makes your mouth seize up and take notice."
US,91.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gorman,"Pale straw in color, this wine brings alluring aromas of toast, spice, clarified butter and stone fruit. The palate is full bodied with sweet, generous peach and tropical-fruit flavors that sail on the finish."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Alto Adige,Abbazia di Novacella,"Lemon soda, powdered candy, peach and white flower characterize the nose of this bright Kerner. There's a touch of saccharine sweetness on the close followed by crisp freshness."
Italy,87.0,23.0,Vermentino di Gallura,Contini,"Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow apple and fragrant wild flower lead into a straightforward palate offering dried apricot, citrus, bitter almond and a confectionery note. Fresh acidity brightens the finish."
France,85.0,23.0,Bourgogne,Roche de Bellene,"The wine has a stalky character, with bitter cherry fruits and light, lean acidity. Very textured, its tannins give a dry feeling to the finish. Drink from 2014."
US,91.0,50.0,Yakima Valley,Fidelitas,"Merlot comprises 53% of the blend, Cabernet Sauvignon 40%, and Cab Franc fills in the final 7%. Well built and satisfyingly complete, this tribute to grower Dick Boushey uses fruit from his oldest (25-year) vines. Scents of toast, mint and moist earth introduce varied fruit flavors of boysenberry, purple grape, cherry and plum. It's a big, bold wine that segues neatly into a finish of chocolate and butterscotch."
US,88.0,14.0,Oregon,Erath,"Bright, polished and fleshy pear flavors hold center court here, supported with a light sprinkling of peppery herb. Proportionate acids keep the wine crisp and clean through the finish."
US,81.0,26.0,Virginia,Bogati,"Citrusy and grassy, this light-bodied wine shows delicate tropical fruit tones on a perceptibly sweet finish."
US,88.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Davenport Cellars,"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the remaining SÃ©millon, this young and fresh wine has vivid citrus and grapefruit flavors leaning toward a hint of fresh cut pear. This is clean, crisp and leesy, with bracing acidity."
US,90.0,50.0,Carneros,Bouchaine,"Rich, thick and swimming in youthful tannin, this is a powerful statement from the producer's estate, a broad-shouldered explosion of fruity and savory flavors. Spicy tea, pomegranate and black cherry mingle around a tartness of grapefruit and blood orange, coalescing into a balanced whole."
US,90.0,32.0,High Valley,Shannon Ridge,"Spicy, peppery, charred oak aromas meet rich blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this expressive, full-bodied and dry wine. It's rather heavy on the oak, which serves to add complexity and firm tannin, keeping it well-structured through the spicy finish."
US,90.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Burrell School Vineyards,"This wine from the top of the Santa Cruz Mountains has a distinctively intriguing nose, with sweet chive, yellow onion, lemon shaved ice, wet cement and pink grapefruit blossom aromas. Iodine and a quinine character greets the palate, with slight hints of balanced almond, lime pith and citrus-blossom flavors."
US,88.0,19.0,Santa Barbara County,Alapay,"Typically bright and floral-fruity, this offers up a big mouthful of lemonade, peach juice, and honeyed, wildlfower flavors. ItÃs creamy and rich, and really a lot of fun, a wine to enjoy, not ponder over."
US,89.0,29.0,Applegate Valley,Quady North,"Cofermented with a splash of Viognier, this was aged in one-third new French oak. It's got a dose of the Syrah funk, with spice, a streak of wintergreen, and musky cherry fruit. It's interesting and nicely woven together, ready for near-term drinking."
US,88.0,15.0,Livermore Valley,Wente,"A great value from Wente, this is a layered, bright and intensely lemon-tinged Chardonnay, worth stocking up for simple dinners and get togethers where you know a lot of people will want to drink white."
US,87.0,23.0,Monticello,Lovingston,"Scents of raspberries, flowers and exotic spices take the lead. The palate feels broad and untethered, featuring glossy tannins, balanced acids and a pliable finish."
Italy,92.0,75.0,Sant'Antimo,Col d'Orcia,"Olmaia (100% Cabernet Sauvignon) delivers power and intensity with interwoven tones of ripe fruit, spice, forest floor and leather. The wine exhibits a rich and smooth texture that helps drive it along the palate in a soft and very pleasurable manner."
France,93.0,65.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Pomino,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi,"Made predominantly from Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco, this opens with delicate white flower and orchard fruit aromas. The bright palate offers yellow apple, lemon and rosemary flavors, set against fresh acidity."
US,90.0,27.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lincourt,"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. Elegant and impressive for drinking now."
US,88.0,16.0,Sonoma County,Rodney Strong,"A plush, fancy Cabernet with all the trimmings. Ripe, opulent fruit is the foundation; above that, oak provides spicy complexities. The tannins are supersoft and plush, like drinking velvet, which may not contribute to the wine?s longevity but definitely makes it pleasing to drink right now."
US,94.0,75.0,Howell Mountain,Duckhorn,"Bottled in March 2010 and released in September 2011, this wine is still drinking young and fresh, with firm, rustic tannins. It's gigantic in mineral-infused blackberries and black currants; the flavors are deep, intense and long-lasting into the finish. An impressive wine whose astringency requires aging, hold this until 2017, at the very least."
Argentina,82.0,7.0,Mendoza,Funky Llama,"Light, tropical but ultimately dilute, with chalky, drying, tart flavors that run toward lemon and underripe pineapple. Lemony on the finish and monotone."
US,80.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Rooster Hill,"Orange rind and Chinese spices make for an intriguing opener but the palate falls flat, with little to offer but a few simple lemon and lime flavors. Short finish."
US,90.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Spoto,"This Merlot-dominated wine includes 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Its personality has bright and brooding sides, edged with subtle sage perfume, juicy dark cherry flavors and sizable oak."
Italy,89.0,34.0,Venezia Giulia,Bressan,"The wine opens with dark concentration and segues into aromas of red fruit, peppermill, resin, pine, rhubarb and smoked ham. The exotic, almost spicy, flavors are very attractive as are its dusty tannins."
France,88.0,18.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Cavalier,"This fresh, crisp, textured wine has pepper as well as red fruit flavors. It offers a touch of spice, ripe strawberries and delicious final acidity."
US,93.0,75.0,Atlas Peak,Duckhorn,"Burly and brawny in tar and leather, this muscular wine is showy and yet totally delicious. It's worthwhile and hard to resist in its full embrace of smoky oak, black-cherry liqueur and blackberry jam. Soft and succulent, it finishes as robust as it started?a good poster child for the oft-maligned variety."
US,81.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,Gracianna,"Green, unripe vegetal flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It does have some decent raspberry and cherry flavors, but turns sour on the finish."
Spain,89.0,25.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Nora,"Aromas of candle wax, nectarine and lees carry the bouquet on this well-aged AlbariÃ±o that's round and full in body. Flavors of baked apple, citrus, almond skins and vanilla are briny, while the finish feels and tastes creamy and leesy. Drink now."
US,86.0,17.0,Alexander Valley,Souverain,"Here's a good, rugged but dry and fruity Merlot for drinking now. It has pleasant cherry, berry, cola, herb and pepper flavors. Production was 5,000 cases."
Italy,86.0,28.0,Collio,Subida di Monte,"The nose isn't very expressive but it eventually reveals delicate whiffs of white spring flower and green apple that carry over to the palate along with a hint of citrus. Racy acidity gives it a crisp, clean finish."
Spain,93.0,62.0,Rioja,ViÃ±edos de Paganos,"Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola. The palate is tight, properly stretched and racy, with bursting black raspberry and cassis flavors. Coconut and resin on the finish is the first and only glaring announcement of oak. Drink now through 2014."
US,85.0,12.0,California,Black Ink,This light-bodied wine has a pale pink ProvenÃ§al color but quite a bit of fruit flavor. It feels soft on the palate and tastes lightly sweet.
US,89.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Bergevin Lane,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine suggests smoke, cocoa, dry chocolate, dark fruit and barrel spices. The flavors are chocolaty and candy-bar sweet backed by a firm grip of tannins."
US,88.0,32.0,Umpqua Valley,Delfino,"An aromatic, low-alcohol Syrah, this opens with spice, pepper and tart cranberry fruit. It layers in flavors of blue plum and a light wreath of smoke. It's an elegant style, miles away from the usual amped-up blockbuster Northwest Syrahs."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Falerno del Massico,Masseria Felicia,"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. The steely palate offers grapefruit, lemon zest and nectarine alongside energizing mineral and fresh acidity. It has a clean, refreshing finish."
US,88.0,15.0,Oregon,Primarius,"The aromas of forest floor, cherry, smoke, strawberry and herb provide intrigue. The flavors are light and elegant, hanging on the finish."
US,88.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Finn Hill,"Char, firepit, barrel spice and herb aromas lead to elegantly styled cranberry flavors in this wine. The tannins lend a light structure."
Argentina,90.0,28.0,Mendoza,El Enemigo,"Earthy, woodsy, spicy aromas of cherry and cassis set up a tannic palate with more than enough grip. Baked oaky berry flavors come with mint and spice notes, while this feels scratchy on a fiery finish. Drink through 2020."
US,91.0,35.0,Sierra Foothills,Terre Rouge,"High Slopes begins tannic and tight but settles down into a finely honed Syrah of notable structure, layered in pepper, smoke and tart blackberry flavor. It will pair deliciously with savory dishes along the lines of cassoulet or roast game and cellar another 5??0 years."
France,86.0,29.0,Givry,Domaines Devillard,"Fragrant wine, ripely perfumed, its tannins bringing out red berry fruits and a shapely structure. It also has a fresh feel to it from the intense acidity at the end. Age for a year, but drink now."
US,89.0,29.0,Amador County,Yorba,"This easy-drinking wine is full of fruit in the aromas and flavors and has a smooth, non-tannic texture and full body. Its concentrated raspberry and red cherry aromas are followed by ripe plum and cherry flavors, with juicy acidity."
US,88.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ryan Patrick,"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ?naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish."
US,90.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,ChÃ¢teau Bianca,"Despite the low alcohol reading, this comes across as dry rather than off dry. Apple, pear and white peach anchor a just-ripe-enough wine with highlights of citrus oil. There's good length and focus throughout."
France,88.0,14.0,CorbiÃ¨res,ChÃ¢teau Ollieux Romanis,"Juicy red plum and bright berries fill the palate, while accents of savory herbs and wild animal add depth to the nose. Balanced and approachable with a satiny structure and a medium-length finish. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Canneta,"This opens with subtle dark-skinned berry, baking spice and leafy underbrush aromas. The round palate offers fleshy blackberry, star anise and white pepper notes, punctuated by ripe tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,86.0,18.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Helwig,"Think of a pink version of Beaujolais Nouveau. The grapy flavors light up this light-bodied, extroverted rosÃ© even more than the almost fluorescent pink color. Very fresh, light and frothy and all those qualities seem right for it."
Spain,88.0,18.0,Cava,Vilarnau,"Briny citrus aromas come with a mild cheesy accent. In the mouth, this is fresh and clean, with typical rosÃ© Cava flavors of pepper, milk chocolate, plum and cherry. The finish feels a touch clunky but overall this Trepat-based bubbly gets it right."
US,90.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Syncline,"Always extremely popular, this Southern RhÃ´ne-style six-grape blend is especially noteworthy in 2011. It's a powerful wine that has a broad array of red and purple fruits, plus penetrating focus. This is juicy, forward and immediately delicious, and it also has the structure to age, perhaps surprisingly well."
US,90.0,32.0,Oak Knoll District,Trefethen,"A fine Chardonnay, front-loaded with tropical fruit, Asian pear, and green apple flavors, with rich honey and vanilla from charred oak barrels. With a crunch of acidity, it's Trefethen's best Chardonnay in years."
US,88.0,60.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Kings Mountain,"Lots of rich, ripe raspberry and cherry jam fruit in this dry, briskly acidic Pinot Noir. Oak shows up in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. It's a little irregular in tannins, but delicious for drinking now, after decanting."
US,91.0,75.0,Howell Mountain,Charles Krug,"This wine is all bramble and brawn. High-octane in power and ripeness, it has a juicy core of mocha-laced blackberry fruit. Pencil shavings and gravel notes add a tease of minerality amongst all that richness."
US,89.0,55.0,Alexander Valley,Ferrari-Carano,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this interesting blend seems ready to drink now. It's soft and smooth in the mouth, with opulently ripe flavors of blackberries, chocolate, bacon, sweet oak, pepper and a touch of funk."
US,86.0,29.0,Bennett Valley,Frostwatch,"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines."
France,91.0,17.0,Saumur,ChÃ¢teau de BrÃ©zÃ©,"A ripe and honeyed wine, this is dry and with acidity along with fresh fruitiness. It's crisply textured, refreshingly perfumed and with delicious, pure apple flavors and acidity. It's a wine to drink now, although better to age until 2017."
Argentina,85.0,11.0,Mendoza,St. Lucas,"Seems as though St. Lucas's white wines are more sturdy than its reds. This Chard is fleshy and won't last much longer, but for dense melon, peach and cider-like flavors and relatively good balance, it's making the grade. Plump and tropical on the finish as it battles to stay in line."
Argentina,87.0,14.0,Mendoza,Argento,"Gritty berry aromas require airing. This is grabby, full and fresh on the tongue, with zesty acidity and overall good balance. A heavily oaked flavor profile includes mint and chocolate along with generic berry and plum. Resiny oak carries the finish."
US,85.0,17.0,Russian River Valley,Kenwood,"A pale shadow of richer Russian River Pinot, but with plenty of flavor and appellation character. Sort of an introductory  Pinot, with pretty cola and cherry flavors and silky tannins. Snaps to a quick finish."
Italy,83.0,15.0,Valpolicella Classico,Novaia,"This easy-drinking blended red wine opens with offbeat aromas of banana, mixed fruit salad and sour cherry. With more time in the glass, those bright fruit aromas are slowly replaced by spice and almond flavors."
France,90.0,33.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Domaine Guillemot-Michel,"This 16?acre estate is run biodynamically, producing intensely flavored, honeyed, ripe wines. This is succulent from ripe fruit, with the acidity bright and vivid, finishing with sweet pineapple and apricot flavors."
France,87.0,48.0,Alsace,Domaine Zinck,"Earthy notes dominate the nose and hide the lemon and pear notes that are more apparent on the fresh, light and dry palate. This is easy and mild, drink soon."
US,84.0,20.0,Central Coast,Hess Select,"Tart cherry pie, leather and a citrus twist show on the nose of this widely available wine. It's quite sour on the palate, with tart cranberry and unripe raspberry notes, with a touch of green orange and pencil lead to round it out."
Australia,90.0,30.0,McLaren Vale,Fox Creek,"This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now??025."
US,86.0,39.0,Dry Creek Valley,Armida,"Ripe to the point of overripe, with dried blackberry, cherry and raisin flavors, this Zin also is hot in alcohol. Drink now with rich, fatty barbecue to soften its tough tannins."
US,91.0,30.0,Carneros,Bouchaine,"This shows real Chardonnay character, with a creamy texture housing flavors of Meyer lemon tart, vanilla and buttered toast, brightened with lively acidity. It's great to see veteran Bouchaine performing at such a high level."
France,87.0,35.0,Mercurey,Domaines Devillard,"Fresh, soft and fruity, this is brightened by a jammy red-fruit flavor and light acidity. It has a juicy character, with underlying attractive, gentle tannins."
France,84.0,12.0,Vin de Pays du Lot,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"Fresh strawberry flavors, followed by some vanilla and sweet acidity characterize this wine from the Lagrezette winery. With its blend of Malbec, Syrah and white Viognier, this has softness, ripeness and, despite its acidity, a definite sweet finish."
Italy,95.0,132.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Le Salette,"The fruit-driven- intensity and general youthfulness of this Amarone promise a very long future. It's well-built and bold, with a rich, chewy mouthfeel and lively aromas of leather, spice, plum, dark fruit and tobacco. It goes down beautifully, leaving a long endnote of divine chocolate fudge."
Spain,89.0,20.0,Navarra,Artadi,"This wine's earthy cherry and plum aromas come with a hint of milk chocolate. The palate is edged with rubbery tannins, its savory, lightly salted plum flavors growing jammier and more fig-like as it breathes. A textbook fruit-forward Grenache."
US,80.0,16.0,Monterey,Maddalena,"A chilly vintage took its toll on this Maddalena, robbing the wine of ripeness and resulting in a green, slightly vegetal wine."
US,97.0,78.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4?? years to develop, and could go beyond that."
US,88.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Manzoni,"There's a touch on barnyard on the nose of this bottling by one of the region's earlier settlers, with aromas of hay and oyster mushrooms adding intrigue to the cranberry fruit. The forest floor and juniper character is strong on the palate, where tart red fruit mixes with pencil lead and bergamot rinds."
Australia,84.0,18.0,McLaren Vale,Hugh Hamilton,"The Ratbag makes for a pleasant, if somewhat generic dry red. Dried fruit and prune notes are complemented by chocolate overtones and the mouthfeel is soft and user-friendly."
US,88.0,22.0,Central Coast,Brander,"Fresh key lime aromas meet sweeter tangerine and floral scents on the nose of this single vineyard bottling. The acidity is punchy on the palate, with tangy green fruit flavors that recall Anjou pear and lime skins."
US,91.0,38.0,Santa Barbara County,Frequency,"There's a lot of fresh fruit, caramel, cola and Dr. Pepper spice to the nose of this playful blend of 34% Grenache, 33% Syrah and 33% MourvÃ¨dre, complete with label art by Alex Gardner. Tangy purple flowers of lavender and potpourri show on the sip along with tart plum fruit and white-pepper dust."
US,89.0,39.0,Dundee Hills,J. Christopher,"Ripe red fruits mingle gracefully, along with suggestions of toasted coconut, from aging in one-quarter new barrels. There is a metallic streak running through the finish as well, which might suggest that you give it some extra aeration before drinking."
Italy,86.0,120.0,Barolo,Giovanni Manzone,"Aromas of oak, menthol and vanilla emerge. The dense palate offers black pepper, licorice and a suggestion of dried black cherry alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit is already drying up."
France,84.0,13.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Grand Pascaud,"The wine has too much wood. Tannins and spice as well as toast are present, but not enough fruit."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Ghemme,Torraccia del Piantavigna,"Tight, polished and bright, this expression of Nebbiolo (with 10% Vespolina) would pair with game meat, pork ribs or succulent lamb chops. Aromas include cherry cola, mesquite and balsam notes of chopped herbs and mint. The mouthfeel is surprisingly soft and supple."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Roero,Cornarea,"The bouquet offers intensity and character, with subtle accents of crÃ¨me de cassis and toasted almond."
US,89.0,30.0,Red Mountain,Fall Line,"Fall Line makes its Bordeaux blends AVA-specific; here the focus is on Red Mountain, and the wine is composed of 42% Cab Franc, 29% Merlot and 29% Cabernet Sauvignon. An elegant wine, it shows refined tannins, mature fruit flavors, already light bricking and aromas of plump fruits, pie cherry and tobacco. Drink now."
US,87.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Sylvester,"This is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend, and it shows Paso's ability to produce a ripe, gentle red wine that's immediately appealing. There's a nice earthiness to the cassis flavors, and a rich, tannic structure that makes you dream of a perfectly broiled steak or chop, brushed with brown butter sauce with a touch of garlic."
France,88.0,14.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de Fontenille,This has with some tannins but it is much more about the bright red fruits. It has crisp acidity that cuts through the structure to give some a fresh edge to this structured wine. Let it sit for a few months and drink from 2017.
US,88.0,30.0,Carneros,Schug,"This is like a sparking Shiraz from Australia. It's pretty much as dark in color as a red wine, with a full body and a raspberry pie flavor. The palate is a little bit scouring and sweet, along with the classic yeastiness of a sparkling wine."
US,90.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"This blend of 54% Grenache Blanc, 44% Roussanne and 2% Viognier makes for a very floral nose at first, then it unleashes aromas of grapefruit peels, seared yellow pears and candied apples. The palate is racy with joyous acidity and chiseled with wet stone, showing crisp apple and nectarine flavors."
US,90.0,32.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Sanford,"Pears, white rocks, gray slate and lime juice show on the nose of this appellation blend from the iconic Santa Rosa Road winery. Similar flavors also show on the palate, primarily a grippy chalk, more lime and a Meyer lemon pith element, with the faintest hint of struck match in the background."
Italy,86.0,28.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Tenuta Friggiali,"Pretty fragrances recall blue flower, forest floor, spice and bright berry perfume. The palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, delivering licorice, red cherry and a hint of white pepper. It's shy on freshness so drink now."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Kendall-Jackson,"Made in the familiar style that is K-J Vintner's Reserve, this Chardonnay shows pineapple, lemondrop, mineral and spice flavors balanced with crisp coastal acidity."
US,94.0,44.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Cinnabar,"Zesty raspberry meets warm cherry notes on the nose of this elegantly presented wine, which also shows aromas of beet juice, sandalwood, clove, mace and bergamot. The palate is a texturally driven, evolving experience, with flavors of earth, iron and pencil lead melding with sage scrub, wild berries and elderberry."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Mendoza,Bodega Carmine Granata,"Chewing gum dust, red plum and cherry aromas define the bouquet on this racy, slightly abrasive feeling Malbec. Things taste short and snappy, with red fruit flavors backed by peppery dryness."
Italy,88.0,33.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Ruggeri & C.,"Hawthorn, peach blossom and exotic fruit aromas take center stage. The rich vibrant palate doles out banana, melon, white peach and candied lemon drop. A foaming mousse provides softness while bright acidity refreshes the finish."
US,86.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Cairdean Estate,"This proprietary combination of 43% Roussanne, 43% Pinot Gris and 14% Viognier is creamy and robust, although it did not spend time in oak. Apple, apricot and an intensity of tart lemon make up the flavor characteristics, the body round and full."
Italy,94.0,140.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,"Here's a home run from one of the best producers in Montalcino. With sun drenched, sea-facing vineyards (this is one of the only spots where you can see the shimmering Mediterranean from Montalcino), this dense riserva doles out lingering flavors of spice, cherry, leather and tobacco. The acidity is perfectly balanced against the wine's soft fruit."
Italy,87.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Donatella Cinelli Colombini,"This conveys aromas of mature dark fruit and leafy underbrush. The firm palate displays stewed plum, ground pepper and a hint of dried sage alongside extremely astringent tannins that cut short the finish. Tried twice with the same notes."
US,87.0,45.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Ghostwriter,"Rich and ripe with cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and spice flavors, with a nice, silky texture and fine tannins. The acidity is sharp, the alcohol refreshingly moderate. Could benefit from some time in the cellar."
US,86.0,17.0,Sonoma County,Stephen Vincent,"This wine has faint floral aromas and a note of the tropical, built around an unfussy core of caramelized oak that manifests as crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e."
US,91.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Fritz,"Sprightly and delicious, with grapefruit, fig, Meyer lemon and apricot flavors made even brighter by vibrant acidity. This elegant SB will be delicious with a salad of bitter greens, figs, chÃ¨vre and grilled shrimp."
US,88.0,15.0,Oregon,Sweet Cheeks,"Off dry, fresh and lightly spritzy, this appealing wine brings flavors of lemon tea front and center. The aromatics hint at honeysuckle and orange blossom, and the finish is pleasantly granular, with a sweet, sugary edge."
US,89.0,19.0,Paso Robles,Opolo,"Dried strawberry, herb-laced berry compote, maple and campfire aromas show on the nose of this bottling from one of the earlier Paso pioneers of the modern era. It's soft in texture and rich in syrupy strawberry and plum flavors, enhanced by hints of mocha and held up by firm tannins on the finish."
France,92.0,15.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,Mas des Bressades,"A terrific value, the 2013 CuvÃ©e Tradition shows the sort of concentration and ripeness you'd only expect to find in much pricier bottlings. Black olive, cassis and cured meat notes deliver ample complexity, and the wine finishes long, with supple tannins."
France,90.0,16.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Famaey,"Smooth and spicy, this is a soft style of Malbec. It has tannins, to be sure, but they are suavely integrated into the berry fruits, the touch of mint and the spice from wood aging. The aftertaste brings out refreshing layers of juicy acidity. Drink now."
US,83.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Ticket Cellars,"A soft, simple wine, with candied cherry and raspberry flavors. It has a sweet finish. Drink now."
US,92.0,85.0,Dundee Hills,Archery Summit,"This vineyard was developed between 10 and 20 years ago. The maturing vines deliver a supple yet firm wine, anchored in a core of candy cherry fruit. Aromatic and flavorful highlights of cinnamon, clove and candied orange are also in play, along with a subtle hint of herb."
US,92.0,42.0,Alexander Valley,Lancaster,"A very lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with rich flavors and classic dryness. Shows delicious blackberry, black cherry, currant and dried herb flavors, touched with smoky oak, and wrapped into gentle tannins. Should age well over a decade; decant if you're going to drink it now."
Australia,84.0,25.0,McLaren Vale,Shingleback,"A sleek name and a sleek wine. Vanilla and toffee overflow from the effusive nose while sour candy and plum jam take over on the palate. It's a tad thin in the mouth but finishes on a lovely raspberry note that has just a bit of sticking power. Drink as the Australians do, with Christmas dinner."
US,89.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Rooster Hill,"Bantam Bubbly is a delightfully fun, fizzy blend of often-ignored hybrid grapes (Vidal Blanc, Seyval Blanc and Cayuga White). Just a touch sweet, as if glazed with honey and sugar cookie crumbles, it offers loads of sweet-tart lemon and lime flavors. Delicate effervescence and refreshing acidity make it irresistibly gulpable."
Italy,90.0,18.0,Collio,Tenuta La Ponca,"Aromas of nut, apple skin, pear and chopped sage lead the nose while the fresh, inviting palate shows citrus zest, yellow apple and crystallized ginger. A blast of tangerine and a mineral note back up the finish."
US,89.0,60.0,Oak Knoll District,Bolen,"Delicious in flavor, with fresh, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, while the oak overlay adds richer layers of sweet caramel and buttered cinnamon toast. A crisp spine of citrusy acidity adds brightness. An appealing Merlot for drinking now."
US,88.0,29.0,Russian River Valley,Fog Crest,"Fragrant and floral with exotic figueroa, orange and peach scents, this wine is a feast for the senses, playing out on the palate with high-toned acidity, anise flavor and oak."
France,93.0,37.0,Alsace,Domaine Jean Sipp,"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025."
US,83.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Springhill Cellars,"Springhill Cellars has been around for two decades, but this new release of the estate Pinot Noir is a bit of a disappointment. Light, sweet and simple, it turns a bit medicinal on the finish."
France,91.0,49.0,Saint-Julien,ChÃ¢teau du Glana,"The second wine of ChÃ¢teau Glana in the prestigious Saint-Julien appellation is properly tannic with fruit in the background. The wine will develop well, but will still require some time. Its juicy black-currant fruitiness and acidity have power and concentration?enough to produce a ripe, while still elegant wine from 2020."
US,93.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Dehlinger,"This is a structured, full-bodied, generously layered wine, named for the soil in which its grapevines are grown. This is primarily on hillsides, where the fruit takes on a brooding quality of spiciness and texture. Baked cherry, cranberry and rose petals stand out most, as additional nuances of earthiness come into play in the glass."
US,83.0,18.0,Cienega Valley,Pietra Santa,"A dry, tannicly astringent wine that doesn't seem fully ripened. It has green, herb and mint-infused berry flavors. Cabernet, Colorino and Sangiovese."
US,86.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Kennedy Shah,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah shows a somewhat uneasy mix of woodspice, green herb and cherry aromas. Flavors are pleasant, lighter in style and easy drinking, with a refreshing finish."
France,85.0,10.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Michel Picard,"On the lighter side of the CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne spectrum, with a slightly briary note to the cherry fruit. Turns more olivaceous on the silky-textured finish. Drink now."
France,89.0,25.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Louis Bouillot,"A complex, full-bodied wine that is full of mature fruit flavors with a touch of toast to add to the attractive mix. With apple, quince and almonds well blended together, this is a finely balanced wine, that could age for a couple of years more."
US,84.0,29.0,Arroyo Seco,Cobblestone,"Brisk and refreshing in the mouth, with stimulating acidity. But it's a little too sweet in the combination of jammy citrus fruit and smoky oak."
US,92.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Davies,"Sparkling wine specialist Schramsberg ventures out to the Fort Ross area to tinker with Pinot Noir under its Davies brand. This shows intensity and concentration, with powerful raspberry and cherry essences that are compounded by sweet-tasting, smoky oak. Impressive now, but it should gain traction in the bottle over the next four years."
US,87.0,16.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"This is a good wine for enjoying now with Mexican food or a barbecue. It's dry and briary, with black pepper-accented cola, blackberry and, currant flavors."
US,93.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Avennia,"The name pays homage to the Graves region of Bordeaux, and the blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc also mimics those wines. Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years."
Australia,95.0,200.0,Eden Valley,Henschke,"From vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine. Menthol and vanilla notes frame black cherries and cassis on the nose, while the palate reveals supple tannins and meaty, savory complexities. The finish is softly dusty, fine and long. Drink now??030."
US,91.0,42.0,Wahluke Slope,Milbrandt,"No punches are pulled on this hedonistic wine with its aromas and flavors of blackberry, chocolate and barrel spice. It's rich and high octane but maintains a sense of balance."
US,91.0,50.0,North Fork of Long Island,Raphael,"Vanilla, cedar and caramel abound on the nose of this opulent reserve Cabernet Franc. Its unabashed oakiness integrates well into the palate though, adding a sexy, spicy tone to ripe black berry and plum flavors. It's bold, concentrated and a bit brawny, but irresistibly so, finishing with remarkable depth and persistence. Hold till 2020 to allow its brawn to settle."
Argentina,88.0,19.0,Mendoza,Rutini,"A fairly oaky bouquet with overt wood grain, vanilla and creamy aromas includes cherry and plum scents. A mostly fresh, choppy palate is a bit rough, while currant and spiced-plum flavors end with woody, medicinal accents. Overall this works well."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Querceto,"Bright and breezy, this wine is made from 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% other varieties. It offers straightforward dark cherry flavors mingled with a hint of mint and spice. Simple but well-made, it will pair well with pasta dishes and soups."
US,86.0,30.0,Carneros,Molnar Family,"Lots of ripe, sweet jammy cherry and raspberry fruit in this polished Pinot. Crisp acidity gives it a fortunate balance. It's for drinking now."
France,88.0,65.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,ChÃ¢teau La Nerthe,"This is not nearly as rich and plush as La Nerthe's luxury-level CuvÃ©e des Cadettes, but remains a very good wine. Red plum and red currant fruit is medium-bodied, supported by bright acids, while some slightly ashy notes and a hint of cocoa emerge on the crisp finish."
US,91.0,110.0,Oakville,Etude,"This 100% Cabernet, made solidly in the modern style of soft ripeness and considerable alcohol, is flamboyant in milk chocolate, blackberry jam and smoky oak flavors. For all the apparent sweetness, it finishes thoroughly dry and classy. Drink over the next 2?? years."
Italy,85.0,10.0,Delle Venezie,Antica Corte,"A luminous blend of Garganega (80%) and Pinot Grigio, this easy-drinking Italian white would pair with tuna salad or sushi. Floral fragrances are enhanced by a steady, but compact mouthfeel."
US,94.0,72.0,Anderson Valley,Donum,"The flavors run as deep as the dark garnet color in this full-bodied but sophisticated wine. Aromas trigger black cherry, subtle spicy oak and a walk in the forest, while the fruit flavors are ripe and delicious. The texture is like velvet?smooth but not slick. The complexity and inherent richness of flavor seem to increase with each sip, and it has firm acidity and tannins to cleanse the palate."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,Monte Tondo,"Aromas of ripe blackberry, vanilla and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose. The straightforward palate evokes mature black cherry, mocha and spice alongside firm tannins. Drink through 2020."
Italy,89.0,27.0,Valtellina Superiore,La Perla Marco Triacca,"Aromas of crushed stone, oak and a whiff red berry lead the nose. The taut, tense palate offers dried cranberry, smoke, graphite and Alpine herb while tightly wound fine-grained tannins provide the firm framework. A blast of orange peel closes the finish."
US,94.0,150.0,Sonoma Coast,Keller Estate,"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle."
Australia,91.0,45.0,Margaret River,Leeuwin Estate,"A textbook example of Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2007 Art Series offers perfumed cassis fruit just tinged with mint and tobacco. There's ample body yet classic Cabernet restraint, so it's not jammy or overdone. The tannins are supple enough to make it enjoyable now, yet sufficient to see it through 2018, at least."
France,91.0,75.0,Champagne,Taittinger,"Made only from grand cru vineyards, this latest release from Taittinger is in a crisp and dry style, profiting from ripe fruit, lifted with citrus and kiwi fruit flavors, a pure line of acidity and a hint of soft toast."
Italy,84.0,15.0,Veneto,Pizzolato,"A simple sparkler (made according to the Metodo Charmat) with organically-farmed fruit, this Chardonnay-based wine opens with caramel, honey and apricot aromas."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Rosso di Montepulciano,La Braccesca,"Aromas of violet, wild red berry and dark cooking spice lift out of the glass. The aromas carry over to the soft, straightforward palate accompanied by mellow but rather fleeting tannins."
Spain,93.0,40.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Highly concentrated black-fruit aromas of plum and currant are made more interesting by cola and forest-floor notes. This is a dense, chewy and almost fat Cabernet Sauvignon. Baked berry, fig and savory grilled-meat flavors are massive, backed up by a lush, deep finish. Drink 2018??025."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Sicilia,Planeta,"La Segreta is intentionally engineered to be one of those easy Italian whites that washes down fried calamari and spaghetti con vongole. Aromas include citrus, pear, white almond and honey."
France,91.0,40.0,Sancerre,Claude Riffault,"Named after the stones in the vineyard, this tense, dense wine is still young. With steely acidity and a strongly mineral, chalky texture, it needs to age. Stone fruits, acidity and a strongly herbal character are just beginning to integrate. Drink from the end of 2017."
US,85.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Emmolo,"Emmolo has been producing decent Merlots for years, and this '09 is reflective of their style. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not very exciting either, offering pleasant cherry and oak flavors that are a little sweet."
Italy,89.0,65.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Marchesi Fumanelli,"Marchesi Fumanelli delivers a spice-forward Amarone with great intensity and a broad, far-reaching approach. There are aromas of cherry, blackberry cardamom, cumin and cinnamon. The wine is slightly raw and very sweet in the mouth."
US,85.0,70.0,Coombsville,J. Moss Wines,"Perfumed in rose and violet, this full-bodied wine is leathery and somewhat dull on the palate, opting for savory elements over fruit."
US,90.0,40.0,North Fork of Long Island,Brooklyn Oenology,"Lavender and violet notes accent ripe, fresh raspberry in this ripe but crisply structured red blend. The palate is juicy and velevety, showcasing bright acidity and a lingering granite finish. It's full bodied and robust in tannins yet maintains a taut, spry elegance."
Italy,87.0,28.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Uccelliera,"Uccelliera regularly produces powerhouse Brunellos. This Rosso evidently represents a change of pace because instead of power and intensity, you get ethereal aromas of wild berry and green spice. There's also an unexpected touch of sour cherry on the close."
Argentina,91.0,110.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Bodega Norton,"A new wine from Norton named after the winery's Austrian owner, Gernot Langes, is a serious Bordeaux-style blend with creamy oak, vanilla, chocolate and espresso on the bouquet. It's deep, dark and full of cassis and berry flavors. All totaled, this is a prized offering that's textured and ripe. It has the right feel and the right stuff in general."
US,92.0,49.0,Napa Valley,Epiphany,"This young Syrah is marked by jammy berry, cherry and mocha flavors, wrapped into an elegant structure of soft tannins. Sweet new oak adds a lovely touch of toast. Round and mellow in the mouth, it should develop additional nuances with up to six years in the bottle."
Argentina,89.0,20.0,Mendoza,Finca Flichman,"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish."
Italy,93.0,150.0,Chianti Classico,Volpaia,"Structured and elegant, this opens with aromas of blue flower, tilled earth, leather and a balsamic note. The multifaceted palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, orange peel, menthol and cinnamon, while youthfully austere but fine tannins provide support. It already shows nice depth but hold for complexity. Drink 2016??025."
US,80.0,18.0,California,Loken Cellars,"Made by a Nevada-based producer, this rosÃ© from California-grown Grenache is very dark, exuding aromas of grenadine syrup and does follow through on the theme of sweet and viscous on the palate."
US,93.0,40.0,Santa Barbara County,Margerum,"Light and crystalline in the glass, this snappy bottling shows ripe cranberry fruit, thyme and composting violets on the dynamic nose. Though very lightweight on the palate, it delivers waves of raspberry, hibiscus and spicy cinnamon flavors, revealing how layered and vivid that a fresh and bright expression of Grenache can be."
France,92.0,94.0,Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"It's impressive how much honey flavor laced with lemon acidity there is in this wine. The pairing gives the sweetness a wonderful focus, coming to a point of freshness, leaving a delicious, lifted aftertaste. Age for 4?? years."
France,91.0,50.0,Champagne,Pol Roger,"With some bottle age, this nonvintage wine is beautifully integrated. Crispness accompanies a rounder, riper character, with green plum and lemon flavors cut by sliced apple and acidity. The blend brings together the three Champagne grapes in equal measure and reflects that in its well-balanced aftertaste."
US,86.0,125.0,St. Helena,Flora Springs,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon hails from a three-acre block of the winery's estate. Muted somewhat in terms of fruit, it offers instead ample amounts of smoky oak and herb, the tannins firm and generous."
US,84.0,32.0,Willamette Valley,Amalie Robert,"Very tart, with barely ripe flavors of rhubarb and wild raspberries, this late release is already showing bricking around the rim. It's high in acid but low in fruit flavor, and from the looks of it, should be consumed immediately."
US,94.0,75.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"Disgorged in October 2015, this sparkler opens with sublime green-apple tones, offering both tartness and stony minerality. A crisp, lemony mousse adds freshness and vibrancy to the complex hazelnut and brioche characteristics. This wine has long legs and memorable completeness."
US,87.0,25.0,Yorkville Highlands,Judson Hale Winery,"This pretty Pinot combines aromas of cherry and clove with fresh strawberry and cherry flavors, a lively texture and lingering finish. Refreshing and complete, it would pair well with everything from salmon to steak."
France,86.0,60.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau du Grand Bos,"Mushroom aromas indicate a wine that is now mature. It's light, textured with hints of green herbs as well as tannins that are now dry. Not for aging, drink now."
US,95.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"With its high-toned sparkle of lemon zest and orange, this lovely wine evolves to show rich oak and apple pie notes, evoking baked Gravenstein apple, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium-bodied, it wears its concentration of flavor and texture well, finding a well-earned balance through the lengthy finish."
Italy,94.0,79.0,Chianti Classico,Fontodi,"Made with Sangiovese and a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon?all organically farmed?this opens with aromas of violet, perfumed berry, cake spice and a hint of leather. The rich, concentrated palate doles out crushed black cherry, ripe raspberry, clove, white pepper and savory herb alongside firm, velvety tannins. It closes on a licorice note. Drink 2016??026."
France,88.0,35.0,FaugÃ¨res,Les Fusionels,"Notes of sweet oak spice infuse the chunky dark fruit notes of black berry, plum and cherry. The smooth mouth shows clean and lifting acidity partnered with approachable tannins, transitioning into a finish loaded with spicy flavors of black pepper and whole nutmeg."
Argentina,87.0,17.0,Salta,Nuna,"Oily and almondy on the nose, but also layered and stacked. Feels lively, jumpy and pumped full of acidity, then tastes of classic lychee and green melon. Full and driving, with citrusy zest to the tail end."
US,86.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Walla Faces,"This Syrah is done in a surprisingly soft style, with light, peppery, rather pale fruit flavors. It's pleasant, but not a typical representative of the grape's usual power."
France,95.0,398.0,Chevalier-Montrachet,Domaine Vincent Girardin,"This is a deeply rich, very impressive wine from a great white-wine vintage. It's concentrated with the essence of pure Chardonnay. It has tension along with a full texture. Age it for at least 10 years."
Italy,91.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Podere Brizio,"Underbrush, oak, wild berry, herb and balsamic notes lead the nose of this Brunello. Tightly wound, fine-grained tannins frame cranberry, red cherry, orange zest and white pepper flavors on the palate. A hint of star anise signals the close. Drink 2020??027."
Italy,88.0,26.0,Franciacorta,Monzio Compagnoni,"Bread crust and golden apple aromas lead the way and follow through to the lively palate along with citrus zest and toasted hazelnut. Bright acidity and brisk, persistent bubbles offset the rich flavors."
US,87.0,18.0,California,Joel Gott,"This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat."
France,86.0,14.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"Bright, fruity and with light tannins, this is a generous, open approach to Malbec. It has fruit more than structure, plus plenty of black plums and ripe berries sharpened by acidity. It's ready to drink."
US,87.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Billsboro,Green and invigorating peppery tones accent this lemony Sauvignon Blanc. It's not a deeply complex penetrating wine but is vivaciously fresh through the finish.
US,94.0,99.0,Washington,Woodward Canyon,"A blend of Champoux (62%), Sagemoor (26%) and Woodward Canyon (12%) estate vineyards, this wine is aromatically brooding at present, with notes of coffee, toffee and vanilla bean alongside high-toned cherries, dried herbs and flowers. The palate is supremely rich, dense and layered, with milk chocolate, coffee and cherry flavors. Tannins are expertly managed and the wine brings plenty of textural appeal, combining richness and elegance. The barrel notes are primary now, so give them time to integrate. Best from 2025 to 2035."
US,93.0,70.0,Sonoma Coast,Reuling Vineyard,"Farmhouse just-churned butter is most prominent on the nose, opening up a world that then flowers into layers of ripe, rich apple and pear. Balanced and textured, the wine reflects its near-ideal vintage, marked by a pronouncement of structure and power. Finishing with a zing, it will stand up to time in the cellar, through 2020."
US,85.0,22.0,Paso Robles,Villa San Juliette,"There's an abundance of ripeness and tropicality on the nose of this bottling, with aromas of apple-pear custard, mango, banana, yellow melon and even a touch of caramel. A strong upfront acidity flattens quickly into somewhat overpowering bubblegum and apple flavors."
Argentina,84.0,17.0,Mendoza,Medanos,"Fiery berry aromas come across sort of rough and scratchy. The palate is softer and more creamy, with vanilla, berry and pepper flavors. Finishes toasty and peppery, albeit slightly bitter."
France,90.0,35.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"This is an intensely herbal wine. Its high alcohol doesn't take away from its green fruit, gooseberry and cool taste. Perhaps it does increase the intensity of all these elements, producing a wine that is both rich and also taut and mineral. It does seem to need more aging, so drink from 2018."
US,88.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Highway 12,"Juicy and mouth coating in ripe fruit, this wine offers black cherry, dusty tannins and graphite. Softly textured and surely approachable, it ends in a bright note of acidity."
US,88.0,100.0,Sonoma Valley,B.R. Cohn,"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium."
US,89.0,42.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Foxen 7200,"Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf."
US,86.0,16.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"This blend of of 51% Chardonnay and 49% Semillon tastes big and ripe, mostly of pineapple, guava and very-ripe pear, with a rich vanilla finish."
US,87.0,24.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Whitman Cellars,"This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish."
Australia,86.0,15.0,Langhorne Creek,Killibinbin,"This shows off the lovely weight and supple texture of Langhorne Creek fruit alongside bold flavors of chocolate and cassis. Despite that, there's also a nagging bit of green bell pepper that may not be to everyone's taste. Drink now."
US,86.0,15.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Mercer,"Coming from a warm region in a hot vintage, this wine leans into the tropical with aromas of kiwi and mango, with herb and citrus notes providing accents. The flavors are lean and tart, with the concentration light."
US,89.0,28.0,Rogue Valley,Jaxon,"The core strength here is the bright, pure fruit. Boysenberry and blackberry to be specific, along with interesting scents of rose petals. The finish brings in the sweet botanical flavors of Amaro."
US,86.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Simple Math Cellars,"A good Pinot Noir for everyday drinking. It's very dry and crisp and silky in the mouth, with complex flavors of cherries, cola, licorice and beef jerky. The acidity suggests rich, oily fare, like lamb or salmon."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Glen Ellen,"Simple and green, with mint, tobacco and cherry flavors. It's a sound, clean wine. Even though the fruit isn't exactly concentrated, it's an easy wine to drink at parties."
Italy,92.0,60.0,Castel del Monte,Rivera,"A pure expression of the Nero di Troia grape, Puer Apuliae is a beautifully executed wine with precise aromas of red berry fruit, root beer and cassis. It has an exciting and inviting personality and the mouthfeel  is smooth, supple and slightly sweet. Pair it with porchetta or honey roasted ham."
US,89.0,24.0,Lodi,Estate Crush,"Another fine example of Bechthold's dry-farmed, old, gnarled-vine beauty in a glass, this wine is light in color and high-toned in cherry and rhubarb fruit. Buoyed by acidity, the finish offers just a light seasoning of pepper."
US,82.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Rancho Zabaco,"This Sauvignon is just a little too green. The gooseberry flavors have a sharp, minty edge that detracts, and makes the wine taste medicinal."
US,93.0,25.0,Sierra Foothills,Terre Rouge,"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex."
France,91.0,37.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau la Bessane,"Potentially an aromatic wine that will develop a rich, velvety character. At this young stage, the fruit is dominated by firm tannins that sit at the heart of the wine. It has all the density for a good development, aging over 5??0 years."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Prosecco,Zonin,"Easy and bright, this is a great summer sipper. It makes no huge pretense, nor should it. It's crisp acidity is backed by white flower and peach."
France,91.0,30.0,CÃ´tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,ChÃ¢teau Gassier,"This is complex, ripe and full of sweet raspberry fruit. Impressive and dense, it's balanced with acidity and a tense tannic structure."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Guerra Albano,"Fresh and tangy with aromas of white flower and tomato leaf, this lively Sauvignon would pair with fried calamari or spicy shrimp cocktail. The mouthfeel is streamlined and tight."
US,92.0,43.0,Napa Valley,Darioush,"Made in a tart, citrusy style, like an elegant Chablis, this rich, balanced Chardonnay shows candied flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, Key lime pie and stony minerals. Brisk acidity provides a keen, bracing balance."
US,94.0,42.0,Willamette Valley,Sineann,"Yates Conwill is next to the Resonance vineyard, which was just sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot. This vineyard is really reaching its prime, showing lovely ripe flavors of raspberry, red plum and sweet cherry. Generous acidity keeps the wine in proportion and leads through a generous midpalate with highlights of black tea and dried herb. Drink now and over the next 10 years."
France,87.0,25.0,Saint-Ãmilion,Clos Saint-Vincent,"Named after the patron saint of wine producers, this wine is properly balanced, structured and dense. It is not a wine for long aging with its soft tannins and juicy black-fruit acidity. Drink from 2017."
Italy,93.0,129.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Dal Forno Romano,"Romano Dal Forno applies the same stringent quality standards on his so-called base wine as he does his top-tier Amarone. But referring to this Valpolicella Superiore as a ?base wine??couldn't be more incorrect. In fact, this singular expression occupies its very own category in which the utmost attention is paid to the smallest details. It opens with dark, inky concentration and amazing intensity, with black cherry, barbecue spice, leather and tobacco."
US,83.0,23.0,Sonoma County-Napa County,Ghost Pines,"This puckering, tannic and brawny wine has a lot of body and a shyness of fruit, lingering in clove and tobacco."
US,86.0,21.0,Sonoma County,Francis Coppola,"This bold, leathery red includes sizable additions of Petite Sirah, Merlot, Zinfandel and Cabernet Franc. These wrap layers of reduced oak, cedar, dried herb and pepper around a relatively light but round body, with a distinct taste of blackberry."
US,86.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,Coach House,"The aromas seem a bit stewed, with notes of tomato leaf and pickling spices. The blue-fruit flavors are high octane, showing some heat on the finish."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Cantine del Notaio,"Il Sigillo, which translates to ?the seal,??opens with huge intensity and balance, which sets this expression of Aglianico apart from the rest. It delivers sweet, ripe tannins and a larger-than-life mouthfeel that promises a long future ahead. The nose shows a black fruit layer, backed by spice, leather, rum cake and tobacco notes. Keep for 10 years or more."
Australia,85.0,25.0,Adelaide Hills,Thistledown,"Green beans and other vegetal notes combine with pineapple, rancid butter and wet wool in this rather odd Chardonnay. There's plenty of acidity and a creamy mouthfeel, but it's all a little out of balance."
US,90.0,30.0,Horse Heaven Hills,14 Hands,Dried herb and wood spice aromas are followed by sappy black fruit flavors backed by a light squeeze of tannins. There's no mistaking the warm vintage it comes from.
Italy,93.0,46.0,Taurasi,Antonio Caggiano,"Enticing scents of blue flower, woodland berry, moist earth and chopped herb lift out of the glass. The elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry, star anise and cinnamon set against a backbone of firm but refined tannins. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity. Hold for even more complexity and to let the tannins unwind. Drink 2020??033."
Italy,87.0,50.0,Bolgheri,Grattamacco,"Aromas recall acacia flower, chamomile and beeswax. The palate offers subtle lemon-lime, notes of yellow peach, toast and a hint of sage. You'll also notice evident alcohol."
Spain,88.0,25.0,Valdeorras,Avanthia,"Ripe, heady aromas of toasty, creamy oak along with prune, raisin and cedar might be too much for those who are oak averse. Like the nose, the palate is woody and creamy, but also thick and somewhat flabby. Flavors of coconut, mocha, baking spices and blackberry finish woody and with chewy tannins."
Argentina,90.0,80.0,Agrelo,Lamadrid,"Like the winery's Gran Reserva '08, this is a saturated bomber that rides along the edge of overripeness. Aromas of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and coconut are rich and oaky. It feels tannic, with a beam of shrill acidity that props up flavors that otherwise might seem raisiny or pruney. Chocolate and wood resin tones pile up on the finish."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Chianti Classico,Querceto di Castellina,"Attractive on any table thanks to its vintage-automobile label artwork, this bright Chianti Classico shows ripe fruit aromas of cherry liqueur and plum cake backed by soft, savory exotic spice. It's crisp but velvety smooth on the close."
France,90.0,112.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau BÃ©hÃ¨rÃ© Courtin,"Right next door to Mouton Rothschild, this small property is producing wines that are dominated by the rich, firm Cabernet Sauvignon of Pauillac. The weight and density are very present, a solid dry core surrounded by delicious black currant fruits. A wine that will mature relatively fast because of the vintage."
US,87.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Carol Shelton,"Shelton leaves the organically grown Carignane grapes she uses for this wine on the skins for three days, resulting in a dark velvet-red color that's followed by flavors of ripe strawberry with a twist of watermelon. Smooth and easy drinking, enjoy before a meal, on a picnic or with light, springtime fare."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Astoria,"Scents of yellow stone fruit and white spring flower mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers crisp apple, yellow peach and citrus drop framed in firm acidity and a lively perlage."
Spain,95.0,149.0,Rioja,Sierra Cantabria,"This gorgeously crafted, full-bodied Tempranillo is a modern beauty. Marzipan, wood grain, baking spice and black-fruit aromas make for a spectacular bouquet, while a ripped, strapping palate is raring to go. Flavors of blackened toast, fine wood, black plum and blackberry finish with gusto and notes of licorice, baking spices and cracked black peppercorn linger on the finish. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2026."
US,89.0,55.0,Red Mountain,AlmaTerra,"This is a blend of the three single-vineyard Syrahs from AlmaTerra, and is in some respects more complete, but not quite as interesting as the individual wines. It seems to concentrate the minerality and expand the fruit component, but also becomes blockier, and loses some focus in the finish."
France,87.0,15.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Les Vignerons des Terroirs de la NoÃ«lle,"Vines with an average age of 35 years have produced this smooth, creamy wine. A light mineral character shows in a flinty texture, balanced by ripe white stone fruits and pink grapefruit. A touch of pepper comes through in the aftertaste. Drink now."
US,89.0,27.0,Anderson Valley,Navarro,"Flashes of buttery new oak show up in the lively aromas and richer flavors of this medium-bodied, barrel-fermented and elegant wine. It has a fine array of nutmeg, vanilla and lemon accents lifted by good acidity."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Toscana,Ruffino,"Ruffino's Modus (a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot) boasts thick extraction in the form of chocolate fudge and cherry candy. Lighter tones of apple skin and green herbs pick up the rear. It's on the ripe side with prune-like flavors; drink now."
US,81.0,15.0,California,Cannonball,"A soft wine, with diluted berry and cherry flavors."
France,89.0,40.0,Var,ChÃ¢teau de Palayson,"One of a pair of wines from Palayson blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. This, with its 80% Syrah and 20% Cabernet, is perfumed and spicy. With great violet aromas and firm spice and tannin, it does show power and alcohol. At the same time, it has the potential to round out into a smooth and full-bodied wine. Drink from 2017."
US,85.0,17.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"A brisk, savory Sauvignon Blanc with rich flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, green melons, figs and smoky vanilla spice. Tastes a little on the sweet side."
Australia,89.0,17.0,Clare Valley,Wakefield,"There's a slightly charry, roasted or asphalt top note to this wine's aromas, but the wine's flavors are an intriguing mix of cola, rhubarb and red berries, ending with mouthwatering raspberries coming to the fore. It's a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that should be enjoyed over the next few years."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Puglia,Antica Enotria,"Notes of cherry and raspberry open the nose of this organic wine. It is easy on the palate, with a lean, fruit-filled finish."
US,91.0,35.0,Rogue Valley,Folin Cellars,"The first of Folin's 2014s to be released, this excellent wine is 100% varietal, and done in a spicy, assertive style. Loaded with garrigue-like wild herb scents and streaked with the same flavors, it's peppery, bold and exciting."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Maremma Toscana,Rocca di Montemassi,"This pretty Viognier shows bright tones of honey, stone fruit, melon and peach. There's a subtle creaminess that's derived from the fruit itself, and it leaves a lasting floral impression on the senses."
France,87.0,16.0,Bourgogne,ChÃ¢teau de Pizay,"Made from old vines, this concentrated wine has weight and a tight, mineral texture. Pears and hints of yellow fruits combine with acidity and a contrasting touch of honey. Drink from 2015."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Quite dry on the palate, this seductive Riesling exhibits aromas of honeyed ginger with a hint of smoke and petrol. Lime and apple flavors combine with a zippy acidity and subtle minerality throughout."
Italy,91.0,30.0,Veneto,DomÃ¬ni Veneti,"Here's a beautifully crisp and golden Passito dessert wine that seems to shine bright with Italian sunlight intensity. The velvety wine is redolent of dried apricot, peach cobbler and almond honey."
US,84.0,8.0,California,Coyote Creek,"Shows jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries, lightly touched with sweet, smoky oak. It's a bit rough in tannins, with some green notes, but at this price, a pretty good value."
US,87.0,35.0,Hudson River Region,Millbrook,"This bold densely structured Chardonnay suggests notes of candied orange peel, preserved apple and pears accented with caramel and sweet spice. Delicate acidity accentuates a warm spicy finish."
US,90.0,21.0,Napa Valley,Charles Krug,"This is a really nice dinner wine, posh and elegant, yet with richly ripe flavors. Fully dry, with a complex balance of herbs and fruits, and wonderfully rich tannins. Obviously built for the table, a wine that won't distract from your favorite dishes."
Australia,87.0,12.0,South Eastern Australia,Nugan Family Estates,"From a warm, inland region, this is nevertheless a fine value. It's rich and full-bodied without being over the top, offering spice-accented notes of peach, apricot and pineapple. Drink now."
France,87.0,22.0,Brouilly,Les FrÃ¨res Perroud,"The wine is full of fresh fruits and crisp acidity. Alongside that, ripe plum skins and a mineral texture promise short-term aging. The old vines give concentration that adds a firm structure at the end."
US,83.0,15.0,California,Cherokee Vineyards,"An average, everyday Cabernet, okay for the price. It's soft and a little sweet, with sugared blackberry tea flavors."
Italy,90.0,43.0,Etna,Girolamo Russo,Polished mineral nuances come on the heels of berry fruit and floral aromas. This is a spicy and piquant wine with cool freshness and delicate fruit flavors that last a long time on the palate.
US,90.0,35.0,Wahluke Slope,Tildio,"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio."
US,85.0,14.0,Dunnigan Hills,R.H. Phillips,"From R.H. Phillips, itÃs a shade oakier and more refined than their regular bottling. The peach flavors are more concentrated, and sappier, but it comes at the cost of crispness. The wine sags in the mouth, like a Dali melted watch. But it tastes good."
France,89.0,25.0,Chablis,Domaine CheneviÃ¨res,"This domaine is now sold through the Jean-Marc Brocard family. This is a rich wine with yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus. There is a touch of pepper that lifts the fine acidity and the ripe apple and peach. At the end, the wine is crisp and clean."
France,86.0,13.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Suau,"This is a soft, crisp, lightly herbaceous wine. It has fruity peach and pear flavors that are touched with citrus. The fruit dances easily on the palate. Screwcap."
Italy,87.0,13.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Tolloy,"Tolloy brings us a bright and luminous Pinot Grigio with a very attractive price tag. You'll recognize aromas of citrus, peach, passion fruit and kiwi and the wine would pair with tuna or curry chicken salad."
Italy,90.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Pertinace,"This opens with balsamic aromas of camphor, new leather, menthol and exotic spice. The tightly wound palate offers Morello cherry, cranberry, white pepper and grilled sage while assertive, close-grained tannins provide firm support."
US,87.0,19.0,Paso Robles,Bianchi,"Cherry, vanilla and liqueur notes show on the nose of this wine, which starts off with very dense aromas but shows zesty cherry skins too. It's juicy and spicy on the palate, with relatively light body and a boisterous acidity, proving quite appropriate for everyday drinking."
US,91.0,49.0,Sonoma Valley,Exuberance,"Berries are the name of the game in this rich, forward Syrah. Cherries, raspberries, mulberries and spicier, gamier kinds of wild berries mark the flavors, which are lifted by sweet, smoky oak. The mouthfeel is pure and velvety, courtesy of ripely soft tannins. A fashionable wine to drink now, especially with lamb."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Chunky and murky on the nose, with melon and papaya aromas. Feels round but light in the center, with vanilla, pear and melon flavors. Fleshy and simple on the finish."
US,90.0,64.0,St. Helena,Salvestrin,"Mouthcoating, this is a full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Tar, leather, cedar and black cherry stand out as characteristics, with added weight from the heavier, darker elements of chocolate and oak. Drink now through 2022."
Spain,92.0,24.0,Priorat,Clos Gebrat,"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking."
US,91.0,50.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Thomas Fogarty,"This is a very nice Pinot Noir for drinking soon. It's dry, silky and somewhat earthy and herbal, but turns rich in cherries toward the finish. Feels elegant and complex all the way through."
Italy,88.0,28.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Valdo,"White spring flower and orchard fruit aromas float out of the glass. The bright breezy palate shows crisp green apple, peach and a hint of tangerine zest alongside a soft mousse and vibrant acidity."
Italy,98.0,60.0,Barolo,Brezza,"One of the best expressions from the classic Cannubi vineyard area, this fragrant red is all about finesse, opening with enticing scents of perfumed berry, iris, rose, chopped herb, baking spice and new leather. The vibrant palate boasts structure as well as an almost ethereal elegance, delivering succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and licorice wrapped in refined tannins. Bright acidity lends impeccable balance. Drink from 2021 through 2043."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Rueda,Egeo,"Offering a flat opening with no kick, it is akin to sniffing apple juice. This is plump and wan in feel, with melon and banana flavors, while a soft, no-edge finish doesn't leave much of a lasting impression."
US,88.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,:Nota Bene,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot (20%), Cabernet Franc (18%) and a healthy dollop of Petit Verdot. Aromas of green herbs, fresh flowers, soil and barrel spice lead to dark cherry flavors backed by grainy tannins."
Canada,89.0,35.0,Okanagan Valley,Nk'Mip Cellars,"Tannic and astringent at first taste, this wine opens up into a more complex and interesting play of dark fruits and darker flavors. Smoke, earth, char and espresso components are set against tight blueberry fruit, with lead pencil tannins. Those tannins might need a juicy steak to put them back in their cage."
US,89.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Novelty Hill,"The blend includes 7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc. It's tight, herbal and earthy, with a scent of forest floor. As it opens, it adds layers of wild berry, bramble, graphite and leaf, all in good balance. This has lovely proportion and follow through, as in all of the Novelty Hill reds."
US,90.0,125.0,Mount Veeder,Rubissow,"At the age of more than four years, this 100% Cabernet remains an immature clash of fruit, oak and tannins. Everything sticks out, especially the massive blackberry and cassis flavors. The oak is sweet and butterscotchy on the finish. With a superb structure, it seems like an ideal cellar candidate, except for a touch of bitter raisin in the finish. Hard to predict its future. Try in 2015."
Spain,90.0,40.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Like many GriÃ±on wines, this is dense and earthy on the nose, with ripe berry and marzipan aromas. A round, layered, full-bodied palate shows hard, unresolved tannins and ripe, earthy flavors of blackberry, spice, herbs and chocolate. A firm, textured finish with integrated flavors is bullish but classy. Drink through 2018."
Spain,87.0,16.0,Utiel-Requena,Sierra Norte,"Aromas of dry herbs, plum and raspberry come with a medicinal note of Band-Aid. This feels chunky almost to the point of being lazy, while earthy, baked black-fruit flavors are slightly salty. This Bobal holds firm on the finish, which is meaty in texture but herbal and medicinal in flavor."
US,92.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Longoria,"Regional pioneer Rick Longoria delivers a savory, earthy wine from the vineyard he planted, with meaty aromas of shiitake and porcini mushrooms, black slate, cedar and fresh pomegranate. The palate is more reliant on peppery spice, rose-petal florals and dried herbs than fruit, though dried cherries make an appearance, especially on the lasting finish. It's great now, but will thrive for at least a decade. Drink 2018??028."
US,85.0,20.0,Virginia,Tarara,"An eccentric blend of 62% Rkatsiteli, 19% Chardonnay and 19% Sauvignon Blanc, this has scents of currant bud and sage, white grapefruit and white apricot. It's a medium-bodied effort that offers mild flavors and refreshing acids."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Rosso Conero,Fazi Battaglia,This Rosso Conero (mostly Montepulciano with a small element of Sangiovese) proves to be a simple and fresh option that would work with pasta or chicken roast.
US,85.0,14.0,California,Murphy-Goode,"A good, everyday Cabernet marked by attractive blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors. It's dry and the tannins are rich and supple."
US,87.0,15.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Dusty Cellars,"This wine is mostly Merlot with just a splash (5%) of Malbec. The aromas of red fruit, tire rubber and herbs are light and elusive. The tart fruit flavors provide considerably more generosity, with grainy tannins backing them up."
US,88.0,60.0,Sonoma Valley,Schug,"A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes."
US,83.0,10.0,Mendocino County,Sans Wine Co,"This unbaked wine in a can tastes a bit tired, but it has an earthy appeal. The color is a brownish red and the aromas seem dusty and mature. The flavors are beefy and peppery while the texture is nicely tannic."
US,91.0,30.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Syncline,"This wine?the only of its kind in the state?is a blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Grenache. It brings appealing, quite pure aromas of herbs, bramble and red fruit. The flavors also bring a compelling sense of purity, with no new oak influence anywhere in sight. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine."
France,92.0,30.0,Gaillac,Domaine Rotier,"The Loin de l'Oeil grape lends itself easily to creating this rich, honeyed wine. It's intense, with a viscous texture and opulent apricot and bitter marmalade flavors. Drinkable now for its concentration, it will get even better from late 2018."
Spain,89.0,102.0,Ribera del Duero,Alonso del Yerro,"A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age."
US,90.0,48.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"Merlot makes up 55% of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (27%) and equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The aromas of fresh and dried herbs and smoke enchant, while the palate expertly balances fruit and savory herb flavors, with tart acids providing the frame. It leans into the savory but with much to enjoy."
US,87.0,37.0,North Fork of Long Island,Sparkling Pointe,"Whiffs of berry and pressed apple scent this slightly honeyed sparkling blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. It's opulent and floral on the palate with a rich, mouth-clinging mousse that finishes sweetly with a hint of vanilla and biscuit."
US,90.0,50.0,California,Bel Vino,"This suave-textured and lavishly fruity wine combines a rich baking-spice aroma, with saturated blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel of this Bordeaux-style blend is smooth and creamy and the finish is long."
US,91.0,35.0,Dry Creek Valley,Sbragia,"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors. Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years."
France,89.0,16.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Cambon la Pelousse,"Located just south of Margaux, this estate has produced an attractive wine that plays on the fruit of the vintage. The fresh black-currant character is enhanced by light flavors of wood aging. It will age for a few years, so drink from 2018."
France,86.0,30.0,CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau RÃ©aut,"This wine is very juicy with fruit, but also exhibits a strong mineral element that adds texture and tightness. With acidity prominent, it seems to be a wine that will always be taut and firm."
US,91.0,34.0,Livermore Valley,Cuda Ridge Wines,"Everything about this full-bodied and well-proportioned wine is rich: the spicy, chocolaty aromas from American oak barrels, the vivid boysenberry flavors, the fine but tannic texture and the lingering finish. Yet it all stays balanced, appetizing, palate-cleansing and fresh."
US,88.0,13.0,California,Hawk Crest,"A great value in a Cabernet Sauvignon with real varietal character and complexity. Dry and tannic, it's rich in classic blackberry, black cherry and oak flavors that finish long and spicy. Made primarily from Red Hills Lake County fruit, with contributions from Paso Robles and Napa Valley."
France,90.0,45.0,Chablis,William FÃ¨vre,"Made from young vines from the Vaulorent portion of the Fourchaume vineyard, this is an open, rounded and lively wine with white fruits and weight, just lifted by acidity."
US,86.0,20.0,Chalk Hill,Balverne,"Lots of ripe raspberries, persimmons and vanilla in this fairly dark blush wine, along with notes of tobacco and cinnamon. The finish is sweet, suggesting pairing with charcuterie and goat cheese."
France,89.0,30.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine Pfister,"Notes of creamy apple on the nose also pervade the palate where they are joined by a more bitter element that lends both structure and pleasant backbone. In spirit, this is sprightly and pure and brings lots and lots of honest, frothy refreshment."
Spain,82.0,12.0,Cava,Freixenet,"Bland, candied aromas are modest on the nose. Heavy and borderline cloying, this tastes of sugary cherry and peach."
Italy,86.0,32.0,Toscana,Morisfarms,"This red Passito dessert wine from Tuscany offers bittersweet aromas of wild cherry, raspberry, cassis and cola. It makes a simple but clean impression in the mouth and would pair with chocolate brownies or cherry pie."
US,84.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Sean Minor,"This is a simple, soft, easy to drink Cabernet, with candied berry and spice flavors. The easiness suggests backyard barbecue, with sweetly grilled ribs and burgers on a summer evening."
US,88.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Vellum,"Perfumy in lemon, lime and grapefruit, this blend of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% SÃ©millon was barrel-fermented. Light in weight and heat, it offers an extreme bite of squeezed lemon on the palate, as well as a persistence of grapefruit rind. It begs for seafood."
France,90.0,22.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Ferry Lacombe,"Named after a young goat in early Indo-European mythology, this full-bodied, ripe wine has yellow fruits as well as red-berry flavors. A pepper edge contrasts with the fruitiness and gives the wine a rich texture. The fruit and acidity come through strongly at the end."
France,86.0,12.0,Gaillac,ChÃ¢teau Lastours,"This characteristic blend of Braucol, Duras, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is light, soft and fruity with red berry flavors. It is ready to drink with its rounded, smooth aftertaste. Braucol is the local patois name for Fer Servadou."
US,86.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Twomey,"Nice and dry, with a good bite of firm tannins, but it's a little flat in the flavor profile. Shows decent cherry, berry, herb and cedar flavors that could be more vibrant and complex. But it is elegantly structured."
US,86.0,28.0,Sonoma Coast,Apriori,"Light in color and body, this wine takes its delicacy seriously, holding back on the fruit and spice to feature woody, herbal characteristics and a slim body."
France,89.0,49.0,Saint-Julien,ChÃ¢teau du Glana,"This wine is finely structured with the red berry and black plum fruit flavors leading to a central core of tannins. There is good juiciness as well, the whole ensemble promising good medium-term aging. The second wine of ChÃ¢teau du Glana."
US,92.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Sodaro,"This Cabernet blend shows the future of the new Coombsville region, which was officially approved as an appellation in 2011. It's a powerful wine with penetrating blackberry, currant and mocha flavors, while the structure is especially fine and firm."
France,88.0,24.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Domaine Gilles Chollet,"This is young of course, but the creamy richness makes it attractive even at this early stage. As it fills out, the more complex acidity and mineral texture will come forward. Drink now for the fruit, or wait until 2016 for a more complex wine."
Spain,85.0,15.0,Rioja,ViÃ±a Olabarri,"Spice and dark fruit aromas settle fairly well. It's light to medium across the palate, with zesty acidity and standard flavors of black cherry, plum and pepper. Crisp and clean on the finish, confirming its basic but juicy disposition."
US,86.0,16.0,Monterey County,Las Palmeras,"Red cherry, crushed gravel and a defined oak scent show on the nose. The sip starts with fresh yet dark red fruit, leads into a vanilla-laced, slightly sweet midpalate, and finishes on a touch of charred beef."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Montpellier,"If you're new to Pinot Noir and curious, but not ready to spend a lot, check this out. It gets the idea across, with a dry, silky mouthfeel and basic flavors of raspberries, red currants and oak."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Montecucco,Peteglia,"You'll find subtle aromas of red cherry, scorched earth and clove on this solid red. The full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, tobacco and walnut. Fine-grained tannins leave a firm finish."
Argentina,82.0,20.0,Mendoza,Tempus Alba,"Cheesy and way too earthy and murky to be rewarded with anything higher than an acceptable rating. The feel is scratchy and raw, while the flavors seem roasted, overly earthy and dry."
US,88.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Des Amis,"Fermented and aged in neutral oak, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Nutty in aroma, it reveals flavors of cherry, raspberry and vanilla within a moderate body and gravelly texture. It's best enjoyed cold."
France,91.0,30.0,Coteaux du Giennois,Vignobles Berthier,"This is part of the range of three wines from different soils. Marne, or clay and chalk soil, is relatively heavy and produces a rich style of Sauvignon Blanc. This brings out the more tropical fruits and ripe pineapple that dominate the youthful acidity that cuts through the texture. Drink from 2016."
Spain,89.0,15.0,Rioja,Finca del Marquesado,"A healthy wine with plenty of oak. On the nose, it's charred as well as fruity, with raspberry and plum aromas blending with vanilla. Feels tight and grippy, with dry oak, herbal flavors and fresh red berry and tomato. Finishes clean and snappy, with correct weight and length. Drink now through 2013."
Argentina,87.0,42.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Alpamanta,"This cloudy, unfiltered Sauvignon Blanc charts new territory for Argentina. Ripe flavors of peach, pear and melon turn more bitter on the finish, which isn't long due to modest acidity."
US,82.0,30.0,Monterey County,Dahlia,"This is soft, sweet and syrupy, with a cherry pie flavor."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Miner,"Thickly concentrated, this wine offers a wealth of crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©ee richness and complexity, dotted in golden honey and a twist of lime. Supple and medium in build, it integrates the oak and ripeness at its core, finishing with a brightness of acidity that refreshes."
US,89.0,32.0,Monticello,Stinson,"The nose of this wine is bursting with raspberry, cranberry jam, violets and geranium. These notes carry to the palate, effortlessly melding together with a faint hint of tar. Soft cedar and nutmeg from 18 months in French oak offer compexity and a full structure. A smooth texture and well-integrated tannins make for a long and complex finish."
Italy,87.0,84.0,Bolgheri,Le Macchiole,"From Bolgheri, what's fast becoming the Tuscan Gold Coast, this Cabernet Sauvignon (with 15% Sangiovese) offers complex aromas of bacon, rose hip and vanilla. The palate is more basic than one might expect, given the exclusive neighborhood it comes from. There's round plummy fruit and creamy oak. The chewy, weighty finish is filled with residual plum and cherry flavors."
US,92.0,26.0,Santa Barbara County,Melville,"This fruity Syrah is rich in cherries, raspberries, white chocolate and spices. Syrah hardly gets more flamboyant. And yet its structure is firm and pleasant. Drink now??016."
US,87.0,15.0,Oregon,Siltstone,Classic varietal aromas of pear flesh and skin open into just slightly underripe fruit flavors. The wine is balanced and adds tart apple to the pear fruit.
France,93.0,140.0,Champagne,Veuve Doussot,"This is a beautiful, ripe, full-bodied sparkler, balancing rich fruit with bottle age to produce a round, elegant character. It is delicious to drink now, although there is enough fruit to allow it to age for 2?? years."
US,86.0,35.0,North Fork of Long Island,Mattebella,"Ripe bramble, black cherry and berry notes are enticingly fragrant on this Merlot-based Bordeaux-blend. The palate is concentrated with cherry and berry flavors too, but more tart and crisp in profile, with a nervy cranberry acidity that reverberates on the finish."
US,87.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Angel Vine,"Inky purple, as you might expect after 23 days on the skins, this hits the palate forcefully with flavors of blueberry, black cherry, mown grass and mulch. Tannins are thick and chewy, and the finish turns a bit chalky."
US,90.0,37.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down. It's terrifically ripe with green apple, nectarine and tropical fruit flavors that are so rich, you won't even miss the oak."
US,82.0,24.0,Santa Barbara County,Lucas & Lewellen,"A rustic Chardonnay, with a sweet-and-sour orange sauce flavor and a creamy texture."
US,93.0,135.0,Rutherford,D.R. Stephens,"Minty cedar rides atop an expansive succulence in this estate wine that impresses in its ability to support grippy tannin and generous fruit. Blackberry and coffee highlight the flavor spectrum, reaching dark, brooding length on the finish."
Spain,82.0,21.0,CariÃ±ena,Algairen,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports."
France,87.0,24.0,Menetou-Salon,Chavet Fils,"This ripe, wood-aged wine has fragrant red-cherry flavors and good acidity. It's still young, so it does have some bitterness, although the rich fruits and structure all point to a good future. Drink from 2017."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Rioja,ViÃ±a EguÃ­a,"Zesty cherry aromas are offset by powdery softness and floral hints. This feels solid and correct, with bright acidity. Flavors of red-apple skins and citrus fruits finish direct and clean."
France,94.0,50.0,Sauternes,ChÃ¢teau Rieussec,"Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025."
Australia,86.0,16.0,South Australia,Robert Oatley,"Made with a bit of skin contact, this pale copper-hued wine boasts scents of dusty earth and cantaloupe. Melon and apple-skin flavors mingle easily on the palate, ending with some light tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink now??011."
US,87.0,40.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Koehler,"A rich, elegant and accessible blend of Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre with well-ripened cherry, berry, currant, spice and cedar flavors. Showing its best now, so drink up."
US,92.0,32.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brander,"Made from all free-run juice with no oak, this wine by 40-year veteran Frederic Brander shows candied lemon and lime peels on the approachable, inviting nose, along with fresh-cut apples and a growing passionfruit perfume. The passionfruit tang also shows on the palate alongside ripe limes and a lingering grassy note, held together by grippy acidity and pithy texture."
US,87.0,32.0,Paso Robles,Venteux,"This Bordeaux-RhÃ´ne blend is quite soft and lush. It has chocolaty flavors of mashed ripe blackberries, currants, plum jelly and black pepper, wrapped into exceedingly finely ground tannins. Drink now."
US,87.0,6.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Kiona,"A ripe, almost thick, peach-laden wine with big, rich fruit and lots of punch."
US,86.0,23.0,Anderson Valley,Husch,"This is a tremendously light Pinot with a bouquet of yellow cherry and cranberry. It's slightly more savory than fruity, expressing the region's cool vintage. The texture of the wine is soft and pleasant with a subtle hint of fuzzy tannins."
US,90.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Martin Ray,"Apple blossom intrigues on the nose of this light-bodied, low-oaked white. It's both steely and revealing, showing succulent mango, peach and pear. The acidity is lively and balanced."
Spain,83.0,9.0,Calatayud,Bodegas Ateca,"Tarry, stalky aromas fail to make much of a statement. This is high in acid and rugged in the mouth, with a mixture of herbal red-fruit flavors and distinct stalkiness. A grating finish is racy and hot."
Italy,96.0,200.0,Barbaresco,Gaja,"Perfumed berry, rose, fragrant blue flower, tilled earth, baking spice and a hint of new leather are just some of the aromas you'll find on this dazzling red. The polished, structured palate is loaded with finesse, delivering a wonderful depth of flavors including raspberry, dark cherry, licorice, mint and white pepper. Vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins provide impeccable balance. It's still young and will develop even more complexity over the next 10??5 years. Drink 2020??035."
France,88.0,24.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"Hints of superripe, yellow pear and candied pear make for an enticing nose. The palate is more diffuse but light and fresh. Drink soon while aromas are at their peak."
France,85.0,9.0,Bergerac RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau BÃ©lingard,This pale rosÃ© blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is fruity with crisp strawberry fruits and acidity. It has a soft perfumed aftertaste that makes it immediately attractive. Drink now.
France,92.0,40.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau Laffitte Carcasset,"There is no mistaking the firm tannins of Saint-EstÃ¨phe in this wine. At the same time, these tannins are balanced with the generous ripe flavor of black fruit and almost-sweet acidity. The property was  created by Joseph Laffitte in 1759, right in the center of the Saint-EstÃ¨phe plateau."
US,89.0,26.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Seven Bridges,"This is the best of the new releases from Seven Bridges, a Portland-based winery with a penchant for Washington State fruit. Smooth, balanced and mouth-filling, this offers a truffle highlight that sits over the bright berry and cherry flavors."
Italy,89.0,75.0,Barolo,Pecchenino,"Dark berry, toasted hazelnut and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The tightly wound palate is still rather closed and on the lean side in terms of fruit richness, but slowly reveals sour cherry, licorice and a note of ground pepper. A tannic backbone provides structure."
Italy,91.0,55.0,Chianti Classico,Luiano,"This structured red offers aromas of mature plum, wild berry, violet, exotic spice and a whiff of sunbaked earth. The chewy palate offers mature black cherry, mocha, licorice and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2022."
US,80.0,18.0,Monterey County,Mission Trail,"Soft and melted, with sugary sweet berry jam flavors side by side with green mint. Unbalanced, but drinkable."
US,93.0,65.0,Stags Leap District,Baldacci,"Massive. Made from 100% Cabernet, and lavish in new French oak, it's an impressive wine, but not one you want to open now. Everything is on steroids, with a heart of blackberries and currants just waiting to emerge. Cellar through 2011 and try again."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Chianti,Tenuta San Jacopo,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of wet leaves, underbrush, leather and prune. The palate offers dried red and black cherry, grilled sage and a confectionary note alongside lithe tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit."
US,89.0,18.0,Alexander Valley,ChÃ¢teau Souverain,"From a longtime value producer, an immensely rich wine with significantly ripe, big fruit. Has layers of flavors ranging from blackberries and plums to chocolate, and is very dry. But the tannins are great, plush and thick and easy. Might benefit from a year or so in the bottle."
France,85.0,13.0,MediterranÃ©e,Domaine de la SangliÃ¨re,"A blend from a wider area than just CÃ´tes de Provence, the wine is lightly spicy, full of red fruits and citrus acidity. There is a typical touch of pepper that adds extra interest to what is a refreshing wine."
US,88.0,45.0,Knights Valley,Pont de Chevalier,"This takes ripe fruit and oak influence to the limits, with powerful flavors of buttered toast, pineapple, orange jam and vanilla-cream. This defines the flashy style of California Chardonnay, with a honeyed finish."
US,83.0,20.0,Sonoma Valley,Nicholson Ranch,"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary."
Italy,90.0,42.0,Sicilia,Planeta,"Made entirely of Fiano, this full-bodied white is loaded with white peach, lemon drop, sage, rosemary and mineral sensations. It's round and juicy and will continue to develop complexity over the next few years. Drink through 2017."
US,91.0,55.0,Red Mountain,Cadence,"The complement to the Camerata from Cadence, this estate-grown blend is 52% Cab Franc and 48% Merlot. There's a juicy core that is delightful, with ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit. Both of the Cara Mia wines see 50% new oak for a full 18 months, and at this early age this shows as aliquorous, almost bourbony aftertaste. The aromatics display dark notes of smoke and coffee, along with some mocha and cracker."
US,90.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Le Chateau,"Youthful and tangy, this new Le Chateau release of pure Petit Verdot reflects a positive change in the winemaking. The spiced-plum, blueberry and cherry flavors are pure and mouthcoating, and the barrel aging (22 months in 30% new French oak) wraps the fruit in vanilla, coffee, and dusty graphite, leading onto the long and satisfying finish."
Italy,86.0,23.0,Gavi,La Scolca,"Here's a Cortese-based white wine that rests on the lees for extra texture and richness. The wine is redolent of peach, apricot, honey and exotic fruit. It feels fresh and linear on the close."
Argentina,92.0,90.0,Mendoza,Zuccardi,"Broad, woody, buttery aromas blend with blackberry, cassis and grapy notes on a full-force bouquet. This Uco Valley Malbec is lush, fruity and chunky in feel, with ripe, spicy, earthy flavors of blackberry and fresh herbs. A long, woody, toasty finish confirms high quality, length and power; drink through 2022."
US,86.0,16.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Bray,"With a slight sweetness to the raspberry, cherry, pink grapefruit, clove and pepper flavors, this blush is balanced by crisp, citrusy acidity. If you like to drink wine with sushi or Chinese food, this is a good bet."
US,89.0,32.0,Oak Knoll District,Clif Family,"Nicely textured and balanced, this white from a cooler subsection of the larger Napa Valley is more austere than not, a taste of lemon and licorice combining in a medium-bodied package of refreshment. The mouthfeel works consistently from start to finish, the end note smooth and swift."
France,86.0,21.0,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur,"Opulently spicy, this wine is rich, smooth and packed with lychee and mango flavors. Medium sweet in style, it is round, ripe and altogether enticing. Drink now."
Italy,92.0,120.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fattoi,"It conveys classic aromas of bright red berries, baking spices, leather and forest underbrush. The dense palate delivers juicy black cherry accented with notes of mint, fresh sage, thyme, licorice, black pepper and chocolate. It's well balanced, with solid tannins that carry through to the finish. Drink 2016??028."
France,86.0,40.0,Champagne,G.H. Martel,"Rounded, sweetened wine, with soft melon and pear flavors. It is well balanced, with some toast and acidity. It is attractive in a light, apÃ©ritif style."
US,90.0,35.0,Anderson Valley,Domaine Anderson,This extroverted reserve-style wine combines generous buttery and nutty nuances with crisp and bracing apple and Anjou-pear flavors to find a very good balance. It feels full bodied and luxurious but stays lively due to good grape acidity.
Spain,87.0,105.0,Rioja,DinastÃ­a Vivanco,"On first sniff you may want to head for the hills; Maturana is a funky smelling grape with strong herbaceous notes. And while that character never subsides, this smells better with time. Flavors of mint, bell pepper and herbal berry fruits finish round, long and saucy. Only 160 cases of this unusual wine were made."
France,87.0,13.0,Pays d'Oc,La Forge Estate,"Rich red cherry, plum and raspberry tones lead the nose of this fruit-forward wine, with hints of cocoa and cola spice dancing in the background. Those notes follow through to the satiny palate, framed by soft tannins that lead into a solid, medium-length finish."
US,92.0,60.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Andrew Will,"This wine is a new addition to the lineup. It opens with aromas of herbs, dark chocolate, barrel spices and dark fruit followed by a fresh lively palate loaded with dark-fruit flavors, fresh acidity and fine grained tannins, with the finish lingering."
France,93.0,35.0,Sancerre,Daniel Chotard,"A selection of old vines and 12 months of barrel aging have produced a ripe, full and spicy wine. Red-plum and black-cherry fruits are concentrated and dense with flavors of dark chocolate from the wood aging. Drink this powerful wine from 2019."
US,87.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Spottswoode,"The bouquet is a bit flat at first, offering nothing more than white stone fruits and pear. Green melon is amplified by a dose of white pepper on the palate, while the finish is layered and solid; it's the best part of the wine by far."
Spain,82.0,11.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Mureda,"Leathery aromas of raisin and horse hide are shaky. This is thick, grabby and a touch cloying, with baked, medicinal flavors of black fruits and blueberry. A minty, herbal finish feels sticky."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Soave Classico Superiore,Monte Tondo,"Made partly with late-harvested grapes and aged in large casks, this ripe wine leads with aromas of fragrant white flowers, lychee, pear and a delicate note of vanilla. The round palate offers juicy tropical fruit, golden apple and lemon pastry with a flinty, mineral finish."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Salento,Leone de Castris,"Messapia is a solid and pretty expression of Verdeca, offering a supercrisp citrus note, followed by pear and white flower touches. Pair it with sushi or smoked salmon."
US,89.0,42.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Alexandria Nicole,"Moderately aromatic and appealing, this offers notes of soil, cherry, coffee, vanilla and flowers. The palate shows abundant vanilla flavors and surprisingly well-integrated tannins for the variety. Still, the oak seems a little heavy handed."
US,86.0,16.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Garofalo,Scents and flavors of toasted grain introduce this pretty wine that boasts accents of citrus blossom. Hints of peach skin carry some bite in the back of the mouth. Serve chilled and drink soon.
US,85.0,16.0,Virginia,Breaux,"Aged in French oak for 9??2 months, this has a base of 84% Merlot, with smaller portions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It has a soft and nimble core, with a grippy tannic shell and a vein of compost that weaves through the palate. Blackberry and clove notes tag the finish."
Italy,86.0,50.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Pieve,"This opens with funky aromas that suggest farmyard, stewed fruit and worn leather. The dense palate is already evolved, showing raisin, fig, game and walnut that lead to a short, bitter finish."
US,93.0,25.0,Lodi,Mettler Family Vineyards,"This giant of a wine has aromas of charred oak, wood smoke and black pepper, with a palate of dense, deep and smoky tones that feel thick, tannic and chewy. It's a tour de force of spicy oak, fruit concentration and mouthcoating texture that's impressive to drink now but will be best after 2024."
US,87.0,45.0,Alexander Valley,Aje,"Rich and fruity, this Cabernet Sauvignon is filled with ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors. It's a little angular and tannic,  so it might benefit from a few years in a cellar."
US,86.0,28.0,Finger Lakes,Keuka Spring,"Whiffs of toasted wood and cardamom lend a warm, spicy tone to concentrated black-fruit notes on this boldly tannic, structured Cab. Brisk acidity adds balance to fruit and body, highlighting delicate herb notes on the finish."
Spain,91.0,22.0,Bierzo,Luna Beberide,"With pure black-fruit aromas, modest minerality and violet scents, the bouquet is right on target. In the mouth, this is saturated and wide, with smooth tannins. Earthy flavors of blackberry, licorice and baking spices finish solid and toasty. This fits the bill and then some; drink through 2018."
US,92.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Epiphany,"Red cherry, kola nut, root beer, brown spice and a touch of smoke pull the nose deeply into this bottling by Blair Fox and Eli Parker. Baked red and black plum, a touch of mulberry and bloody, earthy flavors mark the palate, which is quite complex and bound together with a strong tannic structure."
US,92.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Hoopes,"This full-bodied, velvet-textured wine has an exotic aroma like a pine forest and tastes like a bowl full of blueberries. Ripe, almost jammy flavors coat the tongue, and vibrate with black currant on the finish. Fine-grained tannins give the texture lots of grip, and support the ripe fruit flavors so they stay dry and appetizing sip after sip."
Italy,82.0,18.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Prinsi,"At first, thin and woody, and not much in the way of fruit. Going back, it showed a little more, but still seemed angular and tannic, although a lot more fruit was visible. A wine that improved with air but only up to a point."
US,86.0,7.0,California,flipflop,"Herbal and appley aromas lead to soft apple and melon flavors in this lively wine. With another sip, a creamy texture and richness come out that add an extra dimension of interest to this inexpensive wine that's hardly a flop."
US,90.0,72.0,Yakima Valley,Owen Roe,"Made from DuBrul Vineyard fruit, this has lush strawberry and raspberry flavors that dig deep into the core, supported by a base of minerality. The tightly-focused finish includes echoes of toasty barrel-derived flavors."
US,92.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Syncline,"This variety is still a rarity in the state, with vineyard-designated offerings even more so. Aromas of cherry, mortared herb and mineral are followed by focused tightly wound black-fruit flavors that persist on the finish. It appears to show a bit more oak influence than the winery is typically known for but still delivers the goods."
France,91.0,45.0,Sancerre,Joseph Mellot,"Celebrating 500 years as grape growers, the Mellot family offers this top Sancerre. It is rounded and spicy with a touch of wood to add to its rich character. Apricots and pineapple are a delicious addition to the citrus acidity that cuts right through the wine. Age for 3?? years."
France,86.0,14.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"Just lightly peppery, this is a rounded, smooth wine. It has a creamy texture with baked apple and spiced pear flavor. The acidity is just right, with juiciness on the finish. Drink now."
Italy,93.0,120.0,Barolo,Ascheri,"This wine's forest floor, new leather, wild berry, clove and balsamic aromas lead the way, along with a heady whiff of violet. Its smooth, structured palate evokes dried black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper, while tightly knit, polished tannins provide framework. Drink 2020??030."
France,94.0,69.0,Chablis,La Chablisienne,"From the grandest of the Grand Cru vineyards, this wine is powerful and structured. Its intense white and yellow fruit gains extra richness from subtle wood aging. It's juicy, ripe and full in the mouth. Drink from 2021."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Collio,Collavini,"This straightforward white has a shy nose, while the lean, simple palate suggests green apple and lemon. Firm acidity gives it a crisp, refreshing finish."
US,89.0,72.0,Yakima Valley,Owen Roe,"Somewhat lighter in color, this wine offers subtle aromas of raspberries, flowers and herb. The flavors are lithe and delicate, with coffee accents that persist on the lingering finish. It's a very pretty expression of this variety."
Italy,91.0,78.0,Toscana,Agricola Querciabella,"This Tuscan 65-35 Chardonnay-Pinot Blanc blend is golden delicious with a delicate toasty-smoky embroidery on the fringe of mature peach, vanilla, banana and white stone. It exhibits beautiful richness and depth in the mouth, with a complex collection of yellow fruit flavors, and bright acidity on the close."
US,94.0,59.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Compared with the generally more delicate offerings from this producer, Bucher is always a standout. It's a raunchy, earthy barnyard expression of rustic cheese rind and dark cherry that symbolizes its origins in outstanding ways. Lively acidity keeps it fresh in the glass, while cardamon, rosemary and Asian spice provide the intrigue."
France,85.0,13.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Le Charmel,"Soft and light just off dry, this is an attractive and fruity wine. Strawberry flavors give a crispness to the background of the wine, finishing with a light, dancing aftertaste."
France,94.0,40.0,SavenniÃ¨res,LoÃ¯c Mahe,"Fermentation in wood has given this wine a rich spicy character that contrasts with the honey and lemon fruitiness and the mineral texture. Aromatic and perfumed with summer blossoms, it is ready to drink."
Italy,88.0,13.0,Trentino,Mezzacorona,"There's a really nice, creamy feel to this wine as it moves smoothly across the palate. As it does, the wine imparts lasting flavors of apricot, honey and Golden Delicious apple. There's a touch of almond spice too and you can't beat this low price."
US,92.0,42.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Rideau,"A very strong take on this increasingly reliable RhÃ´ne grape, this wine from New Orleans-raised vintner Iris Rideau shows dried blackberry, leather, chopped herbs and violets on the lovely nose. It's ripe yet tense on the palate, with dried flowers, fruits and licorice, showing ready-to-quaff elegance."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Lugana,Tenuta Roveglia,"Made from vines that are over 55 years old, this refined wine has concentrated flavors of white peach, citrus, yellow apple, exotic fruit and white spices alongside energizing mineral accents. The creamy palate is brightened by firm acidity. It closes on an almond note."
US,92.0,115.0,Oakville,Etude,"Black pepper and juicy blueberry expand on the palate in this juicy, plush and likable 100% varietal wine, accented in full-bodied ripeness and wafts of vanilla smoke."
US,87.0,55.0,Alexander Valley,Alexander Valley Vineyards,"Tastes more acidic and brittle than past Cyruses. The flavors veer toward sour cherry and blackberry candies, with hints of blueberries, plums and fresh herbs. Not showing well now, but could be an ager. Try after 2017."
US,87.0,22.0,San Luis Obispo County,Cutruzzola,"This polished, un-oaked Riesling shows the variety's petrol note riding high over citrus and honeysuckle flavors. It's off dry and brisk in acidity. With alcohol of 12.5% by volume, it's a lovely, delicate wine to drink now."
US,90.0,32.0,Russian River Valley,Francis Coppola,"From a fine vineyard site, this wine impresses in voluptuous texture and its lovely layers of lemon and apple. Floral on the nose in apple blossom and jasmine, it offers a slight twist of more spiced citrus, like an orange dotted in clove. It spent nine months in French oak, 40% of it new, which adds complexity and notes of toasted oak."
US,87.0,22.0,Oak Knoll District,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards,"Aged in a majority of neutral French oak, the wine has opening aromas that impart generous toasty characteristics before mellowing into nutty, vanilla swirls and a lingering taste of green apple."
France,92.0,46.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"All the rich and aromatic flavors of ripe peaches unite in this fruity wine. The fruit sweetness is balanced by zesty freshness. Together, they create a lip-smackingly sweet and intense flavor experience. This is full-on and medium-sweet with a clean finish."
Italy,90.0,50.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Tedeschi,"Veins of sweet cinnamon and chocolate run through the body of this thick, concentrated wine. Exceedingly soft and supple, it has penetrating endnotes of cherry preserves, blackberry pie and Middle Eastern spice."
Argentina,88.0,25.0,Mendoza,Familia Marguery,"Dark and brooding on the nose, with mint, menthol, beefy fruit and coconut for sweetness. Feels choppy and more acidic than expected, with heavy flavors of coconut, toast and blackberry. Toasty, herbal and slightly scratchy on the finish."
US,88.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Rancho Sisquoc,"Baked red cherry, caramel, black rocks and the slightest hint of dill and mint greet the nose on this blend of 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc, 12% Petit Verdot and 10% Malbec. Black olive leads the palate, followed by blueberry, and the whole package manages to be both juicy and herbaceous."
US,90.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Gehricke,"There's a lightness of being to this wine that makes it ethereal. Light in texture and body, layers of earthy strawberry and red cherry remain crisp and fresh on the palate, with a faint aroma of rose petal marking the bouquet."
US,92.0,27.0,Napa Valley,V. Sattui,"From a vineyard in Yountville, this wine has a voluptuous entry of baked peach and vanilla, with a back beat of tart key lime. Layered and lengthy, it offers flavor and body in abundance, ending fleshy and full."
US,86.0,13.0,California,Entwine,"With lots of spices and maple syrup notes, this smells and tastes rich, nearly sweet, smooth in texture and medium in body. It should be good with barbecue, because the perceived sweetness can soften spicy, peppery food."
Italy,94.0,85.0,Barolo,Luigi Baudana,"Dark berry, pressed flower, iron, leather and spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, eucalyptus, anise and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's already almost approachable but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018??028."
US,84.0,35.0,El Dorado,Perry Creek,"Thick in sandpapery tannins, this Petite Sirah shows very ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry jam, currants, chocolate, raisins and pepper. It's rustic now, and likely to remain so over a long lifespan."
France,88.0,20.0,Alsace,Domaine RieflÃ©-Landmann,"A subdued nose of crushed oak leaf whispers with the slightest hint of red berry. The palate is oak-spiced and gentle: think tart red plum with cinnamon. This is fresh and light bodied for a red, but has ample charm."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Col d'Orcia,"Forest floor, rosemary, ripe berry, new leather and a whiff of earth are just some of the aromas in this structured red. The full-bodied, chewy palate flexes muscle and restraint, offering ripe black cherry, licorice, clove and dried aromatic herb while firm, ripe tannins provide the framework. While it won't need many years to become accessible, it also has some staying power. Drink 2019??026."
Italy,92.0,100.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Arnaldo Caprai,"Plum, dark berry and baking-spice aromas slowly emerge on this full-bodied red. The taut spicy palate offers sour cherry, dried blackberry, ground clove and licorice set against a backbone of assertive but fine-grained tannins. It's still young and primary. Drink after 2025."
US,88.0,65.0,Santa Maria Valley,Migration,"Big, rich and flashy, this is a wine of fruit-driven power. The notes of cherries, blackberries and currants are strong and jammy, and it's oaky, too. The finish is tannic and dry, so you may want to cellar it for a couple of years."
US,87.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Meritage wines must be Bordeaux blends; otherwise, they can be all over the map. This is an all-purpose, affordable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Black cherry and olive, smoke and some noticeable alcohol (14.4% is credited) define a sturdy red in wide distribution."
US,94.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Levendi,"Despite being nearly six years old, the tannins in this wine are still huge and hard. But the beautiful acidity and the incredibly intense fruity concentration suggests this has more time left to evolve in the bottle. It is the essence of black currant, crÃ¨me de cassis and mineral, focused into a single sip. The wine should start softening around 2018, and continue to evolve well into the 2020s."
US,86.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Cameron Hughes,"Here's a nice Cabernet with some extra features of elegance. It's not for the cellar, but shows polished blackberry, currant and mocha flavors, wrapped into pretty strong, dry tannins. Give it an hour in the decanter and drink now."
US,86.0,23.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lafond,"With ripe, forward cherry, raspberry, cola and toasty oak flavors, this is a Syrah to drink now. The tannins are soft and velvety, and there's just enough acidity for balance."
US,88.0,22.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"Marked by strong, bright citrus and vanilla aromas, and a waft of freshly kneaded bread dough and toast, this charming wine has limeade flavors with a toasty finish. It?s dry and has class and refinement."
Australia,91.0,17.0,Clare Valley,Wakefield,"This winery was originally developed as a Cabernet specialist, and the regular 2012 bottling is another fine success. Briery, herbal shadings frame blackberry fruit, while the finish features a mouthwatering combination of mocha, dark fruit and lingering tannins. Drink this medium-bodied Cabernet now through 2025."
France,90.0,15.0,Saint-Mont,Producteurs Plaimont,"Celebrating both the wide beret worn by Gascon men and the local Tannat grape, this firm wine is rich and concentrated. It has dusty tannins that support the dark berry fruits and balancing acidity. The bright, fruity character suggests it will keep until 2018."
US,82.0,18.0,Virginia,Veramar,"This is a one-dimensional wine, and it offers confected raspberry and club soda notes that rule the nose and palate. It's light bodied and sweet tasting."
Argentina,86.0,13.0,Tupungato,Andeluna,"Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint."
US,92.0,27.0,Dundee Hills,The Eyrie Vineyards,"Spicy pear and apple fruit is at the core, with suggestions of green pineapple, mint and lemon verbena. The subtle herbs and citrus components are layered throughout, and the structure favors long term cellaring."
France,86.0,10.0,Ile de BeautÃ©,Union de Vignerons de l'Ãle de BeautÃ©,"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing."
France,86.0,14.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Dourthe,"Tight and herbaceous, this nervy, crisp wine is full of lemon and lime juice cut with an orange zest. Floral and full of acidity, it leaves a mineral, steely aftertaste."
France,88.0,40.0,Givry,Domaines Devillard,"Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors. The wood comes through firmly producing a solid, very dry character. The more juicy black currant fruits are still to show well. So wait to drink until 2015."
France,87.0,28.0,Coteaux du Giennois,Florian Roblin,"This perfumed wine has a rustic edge that should blow away as the wine matures. For the fruit, it is red-berry time: bright, soft and lifted by gentle tannins and lively acidity. The wine will improve for a few more months, so drink from late 2017."
US,86.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brander,"Lean and tough, but not without a certain charm, this Cab's blackberry and currant flavors are wrapped in hard, edgy tannins. The sweet core of fruit will wake up when paired with rich beef dishes."
France,90.0,72.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Roche de Bellene,"A structured wine, this is packed with tannins as well as dark fruit and flavors from the wood aging. It is solid, backed with a concentrated, dry aftertaste with great potential. Drink from 2018."
France,88.0,35.0,Champagne,Charlier & Fils,"Eight months of oak aging gives this wine its spicy, lightly toasty character. Ripe red apple and grapefruit flavors add to its richness. Finely balanced, it's ready to drink now."
Spain,84.0,17.0,Ribera del Duero,Alidis,"The wine has a murky burgundy color and earthy, roasted aromas that include Band-Aid and latex. This feels bold, tangy, tannic and hard. Flavors of plum, tomato and stalky herbs finish with a stewed note and heat."
US,93.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Hall,"A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld."
France,91.0,95.0,Hermitage,Paul Jaboulet AÃ®nÃ©,"This reticent wine takes a bit of airing to come around, but once it does it shows impressive depth of melon fruit accented by crushed stone. It's medium to full in body, with a slightly oily texture, while the finish has a drying, tactile quality to it that's a bit like chalk dust."
France,87.0,28.0,Vin de Liqueur,ChÃ¢teau d'Aydie,"This fortified wine made from Tannat certainly has the grape's tannins. However, these are surrounded by sweet plum flavors and contrasting acidity. It is a sweet wine while fresh and fruity, and can be drunk now."
Spain,89.0,21.0,Rioja,Bodegas Bilbainas,"Punchy, rubbery, full-force aromas of black fruits, graphite and bacon are loud and oaky. This feels stocky and full, with blackberry, cherry, fig and prune flavors. On the finish, vanilla and coconut take over a very good, ripe Rioja."
US,93.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"Farrell's Starr Ridge Dijon bottling is a fruity wine, bright and forward in red and black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and cola flavors, with smoky oak elaborations and a floral scent of violets. All that richness is balanced with crisp acids and even a dusting of fine tannins. Brilliant and pure, this Pinot should provide fine drinking through the age of six years or more, depending on how you like your older wines."
France,85.0,22.0,Bourgogne,Domaines Devillard,"Light and fruity, this has a fresh red-berry flavor. It has intense youthful acidity, lending a very crisp texture. With its soft tannins, it is ready to drink in a few months when the acidity has calmed down."
Spain,86.0,30.0,Valencia,Angosto,"Horsey aromas of pine and juniper come with a blanket of oak that gives off lactic, plastic scents. Pinched, clamping and rubbery on the palate, this tannic blend of Garnacha, Cabernet Franc and Syrah tastes herbal, briny and saucy, with briary berry, salt and reprise of juniper on the finish."
France,87.0,16.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Ducasse,"On the ripe side of herbaceous, this is a full and rounded wine. It has citrus flavors along with richer tropical fruits, a mineral edge and delicious, juicy acidity. The wine can be drunk now, but will be better after 2015."
US,88.0,22.0,Central Coast,Harmony Cellars,"This ripe Chardonnay is a successful example of its style, with honeysuckle, white peach and marshmallow aromas on the nose. The palate offers apple custard and lemon curd flavors, held together with savory smoke and sea salt aspects."
Italy,92.0,35.0,Sicilia,Cusumano,"The Cusumano brothers have been on a winning streak lately with a string of excellent editions of SÃ gana?a pure expression of Nero d'Avola. Round and elegant, this has integrated oak tones, backed by notes of red cherry, spice and tobacco. This winery has various vineyard sites across the island."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Valpolicella,Gino Fasoli,"This bottling offers more density and heft than usually found in this category of Italian reds. The bouquet offers bright berry, cherry, leather and spice notes."
US,94.0,140.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"Leonetti's 2009 Reserve??2% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot?is a simpler blend than in past vintages, and it seems to mark a return to the style of wine that built the winery's reputation initially. Powerfully, lavishly oaky, with a ripe, chewy black-fruit flavor, it is bursting with notes of black cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and a hint of butter. Though not quite as graceful or detailed as the regular Cabernet, this is the more potently expressive of the two flagship Leonetti reds."
Italy,90.0,28.0,Chianti Classico,Mazzei,"Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity. You'll get aromas of bright cherry and some spice but what makes the wine stand apart is the clarity and purity of its aromas."
US,88.0,19.0,Dundee Hills,Winter's Hill,"This tilts the fruit emphasis away from peach and into pear, with a slight suggestion of vanilla cream. It's got medium weight and concentration, and it's supple, well integrated, and balanced for immediate consumption."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,August Briggs,"Deep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer. Any tartness to the blackberry fruit is offset by vanillin oak. Pleasurable, full-bodied and on the money. It's stylish good stuff with a correct amount of woody character."
France,91.0,13.0,Madiran,ChÃ¢teau Peyros,"There is a solid amount of wood here, but the fruit has weight enough for it. The tannins are dark, brooding in character, but they also support ripe and juicy fruits. With its dusty texture, this wine could certainly be aged for several years."
US,88.0,19.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Silver Totem,"The aromas seem a bit muddled. The palate brings reserved blue-fruit flavors, with peanut shell notes on the finish."
US,94.0,54.0,Russian River Valley,Merry Edwards,"Merry Edwards has had a long relationship with this Westside Road vineyard, which has given her some very great wines. This 2010 continues her offering of delicious Pinots of early appeal, but whose structural integrity guarantees ageability. The wine is lush in raspberries, cherries and currants, yet is elegant and crisp in acidity. You can drink it now, but it will gain in the bottle after 2018."
US,92.0,90.0,Rutherford,Grgich Hills,"Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak."
Italy,88.0,36.0,Sicilia,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"Aromas of candied citrus, toasted oak, acacia flower and vanilla lead the nose. The palate offers butterscotch, lemon zest, yellow apple and vanilla brightened by crisp acidity."
Argentina,85.0,12.0,Mendoza,Familia Mayol,"Small-production (300 cases total) SB from high-elevation vineyards with solid apple and citrus aromas. Basic but clean, with lemon, orange, grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Good for Argentina, which doesn't have much of a track record with Sauvignon Blanc. Drink now."
US,86.0,13.0,Napa County,Kirkland Signature,"Ripe and softly smooth, this simple, affordable wine is robust with toasty oak, coconut, cocoa and baked plum notes."
France,92.0,80.0,Champagne,Billecart-Salmon,"The balance of this wine is immediately striking. Everything is in its place: the crisp apples, tight acidity and the mineral texture are all just right. It's a delicious, perfumed and fragrant wine that is ready to drink with its light, poised aftertaste."
Spain,86.0,19.0,Montsant,GarbÃ³,"Field notes of clover and herbs lend spice and roughness to the bouquet. This is strong on the palate, with herbal-leaning plum and berry flavors. Hard, peppery spice notes ride high on an herbal tasting and juicy feeling finish."
US,85.0,25.0,Suisun Valley,Three Rights Left,"Rustic with softened tannins, this Charbono, a rare sight in California where fewer than 100 acres are planted, is inky and mellow, its acidity a good match for a range of goopy, Italian-inspired foods."
US,86.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Calcareous,"This is a tasty Chardonnay, showing lots of pear, orange, mango, vanilla-cream and butterscotch flavors. It tastes on the sweeter side."
France,83.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Labatut,The wine is tight and perhaps firm. Its extracted tannins and dry core are too much for the fruit.
France,91.0,25.0,JuranÃ§on Sec,Domaine CauhapÃ©,"The quest behind the name of this wine is to make JuranÃ§on wines better know. CauhapÃ© is well placed to do this, and this lightly wood-aged wine is a good point to start. It is rich, full in the mouth with a hint of toast that supports the quince and apricot fruit flavors. Drink from 2016."
US,92.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Conn Creek,"Made from 100% Cabernet grapes grown in this highly regarded vineyard that straddles Atlas Peak, this is dry, full bodied and softly rich in tannins. It has a fruity essence and a toasty sweetness that's driven by the oak, making it delicious."
Italy,89.0,86.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Boscarelli,"Boscarelli's hearty Vino Nobile opens with dark nuances of plum, blackberry, ground pepper, cigar box and carob pod. The texture is thick and slightly gritty with drying tannins on the fade."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Sicilia,Nicosia,"A simple red wine, with cherry, cassis and prune. There's a touch of burnt almond on the close that is typical of this popular Sicilian grape variety."
US,84.0,36.0,Dry Creek Valley,Wilson,"The 16% by volume alcohol on this Zin is high even by Wilson's standards. It gives the wine a burn that it does not wear well. The body and flavors aren't rich enough to carry the heat, the way that a proper Port can. Richly-sauced barbecue is your best bet for food pairing."
Spain,87.0,30.0,Rioja,Eduardo Garrido GarcÃ­a,"Hot, stalky aromas of red chili flake and weedy raspberry lead to a lean, tomatoey palate with flavors of tomato, dried berry, vanilla and especially dill weed. A saucy, woody finish confirms that this is now mostly oak and acid; drink through 2020."
France,91.0,23.0,CorbiÃ¨res,Castelmaure,"More lush and internationally styled than their La Pompadour, the Grande CuvÃ©e offers rich notes of creamy vanilla, jammy raspberry and blackberry, crushed violets and orange peel all graced with a mentholated lift. Big and velvety in the mouth, the long finish reveals seductive notes of black pepper and soft sweet spice."
France,90.0,60.0,Champagne,Soutiran,"If you want to taste ripe Pinot Noir in Champagne, this grand cru blend (with 40% Chardonnay, 60% Pinot Noir) from Soutiran is where to come. The wine has weight, delicious white fruits and kiwi, and a textured mouthfeel. It is concentrated, certainly in a food wine style."
US,89.0,60.0,Willamette Valley,Panther Creek,"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption."
US,90.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Jeff Gordon,"A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley, 10% Cabernet from Sonoma County's Monte Rosso Vineyard and 10% Petit Verdot from Napa, this wine reflects the cool vintage. It offers herb, cedar and peppercorn on the nose along with plenty of acidity and structure. The fruit tends red in cassis and cranberry, finishing juicy."
France,85.0,19.0,Petit Chablis,La Chablisienne,"As if to emphasize that Petit Chablis has an important place in the Chablis hierarchy, the Chablis cooperative produces its aptly named Pas si Petit?ânot so little.??It's a soft, immediately drinkable wine, full of ripe lime and pear flavor. It is light and ready to drink."
France,89.0,15.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine de Colonat,Granit is the sandy granite hillside soil of northern Beaujolais. The vineyard is a neighbor to the Fleurie appellation. This textured wine is rich with cherry and red-currant flavors that are rounded out and have just hint of tannins. The wine could soften even more so wait until early 2016.
Spain,88.0,12.0,CariÃ±ena,ViÃ±edos y Bodegas Pablo,"Sweet, ripe, rich and a little baked on the bold bouquet, with a good mouthfeel, layered blackberry and plum fruit, and then a long, robust and clean finish. As value-priced Garnacha from Spain goes, this is on the dot."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,Dourthe,"Solid tannins still dominate this potentially ripe and full-bodied wine. It has the richness and structure of the vintage, giving ripe red fruits from the Merlot as well as tight tannins that need to soften. Drink from 2016."
US,90.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Crux,"Feral strawberry grabs all the attention in this wildly fierce, high-acid wine that packs a punch in texture, tannin power and body. Small amounts of Syrah, MourvÃ¨dre and Petite Sirah figure into the blend, which is made in minuscule amounts."
US,86.0,20.0,North Fork of Long Island,Lieb,"Smoky, slightly nutty aromas dissipate with aeration to reveal fresher notes of apple, lemon and pear here. While closed and tight in profile, fresh acidity and juicy citrus flavors are easygoing and approachable."
US,90.0,19.0,Washington,Dunham,"The bouquet offers intriguing aromas of berry, black olive, vanilla and other barrel spices. The chocolate and cherry flavors are elegant, soft and creamy in feel, showing a pleasing sense of balance. A delicious and attractive red that's drinkable now."
US,90.0,26.0,Lodi,Acquiesce,"Dry, elegant and nicely reserved, this light-bodied wine is refreshing and intriguing. Subtlety works its magic in the bosc pear aromas and white peach flavors, and the crisp texture whets the appetite."
France,87.0,15.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,ChÃ¢teau d'Or et de Gueules,"This plump, medium-bodied rosÃ© offers hints of peach and melon fruit, then finishes long and citrusy. It's very pale salmon in color, with an attractive coppery tint."
US,87.0,15.0,North Coast,Novy,"Full-flavored and assertive, this has vivid herbal and citrus flavors that pop in the aromas and continue on the palate. It's full bodied, tangy, and mouth-filling, great for creamy pasta dishes and seafood."
US,85.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Torii Mor,"Slightly soapy in the nose, this enters softly, then turns sharp and slightly bitter. Hints of melon and butter emerge, but the mouthfeel is somewhat disjointed and the flavors not yet fully integrated."
US,84.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"The ripeness of the grapes ran away in this wine, so that despite high alcohol, it still retains what tastes like residual sugar. The result is an excessively sweet wine. It's almost like a minor Port."
US,89.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Swiftwater Cellars,"Aromas are quite light, with notes of woodspice and herb. The palate is more showy, with sweet, ripe purple-fruit flavors backed by oak spices, missing a bit in the middle."
Spain,81.0,9.0,Almansa,Bodegas Tintoralba,"Right from the start things are stretched thin. It smells raw and feels dilute, with flavors of sour plum and a bit of wood resin. Fiery and tart on the finish."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Barbaresco,Moccagatta,"This has a dark ruby appearance, opening with succulent aromas of black cherry, bitter chocolate and licorice. It boasts loads of intensity and a youthful, astringent quality to its tannins. Let it age 10 years or more."
France,93.0,57.0,Sancerre,Alphonse Mellot,"From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018."
France,85.0,13.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Suau,"Soft, open wine, with some attractive perfumed character as well as light acidity. It is somewhat unfocused, missing structure. Screwcap."
France,84.0,28.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine de la Denante,"This wine has soft fruit, a creamy texture and light acidity. It is balanced, fruity with apple and spice flavors. The aftertaste introduces a drier, woody character that is less attractive."
US,91.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Red Car,"This wine draws from a handful of tremendous vineyard sites, including the producer's estate, Platt and Clary Ranch, all cool-climate and windswept. It's a tight, light and minimally messed-with wine, bright in cherry, pomegranate and rose."
Italy,90.0,31.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Coldisole,"Part of the Lionello Marchesi collection of Italian estates, Coldisole consistently produces quality Brunello with a large enough case production to make the wines reasonably easy to locate in the USA. This expression offers a bright, ruby appearance followed by vibrant aromas of cherry and spice."
France,85.0,18.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau des Tourtes,"Despite the label indication that this wine is Sauvignon Blanc, it does in fact have 20% SÃ©millon. That addition fills out the wine while retaining the natural herbaceous character with its grassy texture and strongly citrus flavors. Drink now."
Argentina,86.0,11.0,San Juan,Tour 52,"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest."
Spain,85.0,4.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Felix Solis,"Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish."
France,85.0,9.0,Beaujolais,Henry Fessy,"Henry Fessy's can-can dancer is with us again on this bottle of red cherry fruity wine. There is a texture of acidity, the fruit attractively integrated. Soft tannins complete this fresh, fruity wine."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico,Vicari,"This attractive wine opens with intensely floral aromas of white spring flowers accented by whiffs of stone fruit. It has a linear palate, with juicy flavors of peach and lemon alongside crisp, refreshing acidity."
US,85.0,38.0,South Coast,South Coast,"Shows how ripe red wines get in the Temecula area, with juicy blackberry, cherry, cola, licorice, sweet cured tobacco and cinnamon spice flavors. The tannins are smooth and refined. Finishes a little on the sweet, candied side."
US,87.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,Lucas Vineyards,The Lucas 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah shows the potential the Syrah grape has in upstate New York. Dense raspberry and strawberry fruit vie with aromas of barbecued meat on the nose while a thick layer of vanilla cushions the fine tannins and smokey notes in the mouth. The juicy finish throws up an enticing licorice note. Nicely done. Drink now to 2011.
US,86.0,16.0,Umpqua Valley,Henry Estate,"On the plus side, this is a well-ripened, full-bodied wine, with a mix of pear and citrus. It's lightly spicy and drinking at its peak, broad and just a little flat on the palate."
France,90.0,16.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Domaine le Renard,"The blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah mixes notes of black cherries with hints of red raspberries to create a delicious tension. Dried spices and mocha add nuance, while the tannins are firm at first, fading to the texture of cocoa powder on the long finish. Drink now??022."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,Enrique Foster,"Despite showing a yellow color and gritty oiliness on the nose, this feels round and complete, with tropical flavors of mango, papaya and green melon. Everything about this is mild, inoffensive and tropical. Drink now before it starts to fade."
Canada,93.0,30.0,Okanagan Valley,CedarCreek,"Fragrant, with a floral lift in the nose, this is loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and citrus. A whiff of toast and just-sawn wood leads into a lengthy, beautifully balanced, tongue-coating finish."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Mendoza,Don Miguel GascÃ³n,"Floral red-fruit aromas become more jammy and sweet with airing. This feels fresh despite being chunky in weight, with citrusy acidity. Flavors of red plum, apple skins and blueberry finish with a green hint, raciness and red-fruit acidity."
US,82.0,42.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Talbott,"This is not a successful Sleepy Hollow Vineyard bottling. The cold vintage took its toll, resulting in a wine whose cherry and tart cranberry flavors are cut through with a streak of green veggies. Drink up."
US,87.0,40.0,Sonoma Valley,St. Francis,"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Rueda,MarquÃ©s de la Concordia,"Dusty apricot, peach and citrus aromas come in front of a snappy, basic palate with racy acidity. Citrus, banana and pineapple flavors finish fresh and modest. This is nice and perfectly appealing. It's ideal for patio sipping."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Tenuta degli Ultimi,"This opens with heady aromas of acacia, wild flowers, white tree fruit and a whiff of sage. Brisk acidity and firm, persistent bubbles offset creamy pear, crisp apple and citrus zest flavors. It closes on an almond note."
US,84.0,10.0,Lodi,un4seen,"Notes of sour apple and lemon accompany this wine's dialed-high acidity. Priced to sell, it'll suffice in certain settings as an apÃ©ritif or quaffer with snacks."
Italy,87.0,11.0,Trentino,Rotari,"A little peach, a little cantaloupe and plenty of rich character courtesy of the Pinot Nero. A nice cocktail-party wine with significant substance. It rolls on the tongue and leaves a clean and precise palate feel. Sweetness is not a problem here; it barely shows any toast or yeast. It?s cool and collected Italian bubbly."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano,"Structured and sophisticated, it offers creamy green apple, pear, citrus and white peach sensations. The juicy fruit palate is restrained by subtle notes of white pepper and mineral alongside fresh acidity that leaves a focused, lingering finish."
Italy,91.0,125.0,Barolo,Borgogno,"Aromas of dark berry, baking spice, Alpine herb, graphite, iris and a whiff of game take center stage. The warm, enveloping palate delivers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, white pepper and anisette alongside velvety tannins and nervous acidity. Drink 2016??026."
US,91.0,30.0,Sonoma County,Kendall-Jackson,"The vintage was a good one for all K-J's Cabernets, and this Grand Reserve offers lots of bang for your buck. It's full-bodied and dry, with rich blackberry jam, red currant, licorice and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy."
Italy,90.0,33.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Salicutti,"This is no simple red; deep black fruit and leather aromas suggest an intense, young untamed wine. It's rugged and muscular, with an opaque color, tight tannins that starch the cheeks, and a powerful, multilayered finish. Baby Brunello? Hardly. This is a full-grown wine all its own, and it still needs several more years to open up."
US,94.0,52.0,Red Mountain,Lauren Ashton Cellars,"This is mostly Syrah, with 10% each Grenache and MourvÃ¨dre. Fat and beefy, it starts with a scent of fresh carpaccio around dense black cherry fruit. Lush and generous, with notes of both fruit and barrel, it adds streaks of coffee and cacao that wind through a long and beautifully defined finish."
Italy,86.0,11.0,Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,Talamonti,"Trebbiano is part of that great family of Italian whites that refreshes and revitalizes the palate?especially on warm summer afternoons. Talamonti delivers a pristine expression with grassy notes, citrus and peach."
US,83.0,28.0,Mendocino,Rivino,"Honey-sweet and simple, with crisp, jammy flavors of berries, cherries and cocoa. It's a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Viognier."
US,88.0,25.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Vital,"The aromas are light, with notes of cranberry, blueberry and wood spice. The palate brings plush but tart cranberry flavors that linger on the finish."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Roero,Cascina Chicco,"Aromas that recall red berry, chopped herb, baked earth and a whiff of leather lead the way on this polished wine. The linear palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry wild mint and a touch of white pepper that carry through to the firm finish."
US,90.0,50.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,La Rusticana d'Orsa,"Hailing from a hillside estate of hand-tended grapes, this traditional Bordeaux blend begins with a menthol, roasted fennel and cinnamon-touched nose. On the palate, the herbals continue alongside ripening plum and gingerbread cake, followed by a lingering finish."
Italy,92.0,70.0,Taurasi,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Underbrush, black-skinned fruit, exotic spice, leather and balsamic aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. The austere structured palate offers dried black cherry, star anise, tobacco and clove framed in bracing, fine-grained tannins. Don't even attempt it for another few years. Drink 2021??031."
Italy,90.0,59.0,Greco di Tufo,Cantine di Marzo,"Vibrant and structured, it has aromas of flint, brimstone, lemon zest and grapefruit, all of which carry over to the palate alongside racy acidity. The bright, juicy palate is accented with energizing mineral that add depth."
France,92.0,50.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau Le Boscq,"Solid and firm, this initially tannic wine has ripe black fruits under the tough surface. It will take time to bring out the potential richness and complex flavors. Wait until 2018."
France,88.0,23.0,Gigondas,Les Trois Couronnes,"A fresh, appealing example of Gigondas, with mouth-watering cherry fruit that's blissfully uncomplicated yet satisfying for its verve and intensity. A hint of cocoa sneaks in on the finish. Drink it over the next few years."
Italy,93.0,75.0,Franciacorta,Ca' del Bosco,"Subtle but enticing scents of pear, citrus zest, pastry and a warm whiff of freshly baked bread lead the nose. The smooth, creamy palate delivers juicy yellow apple, tangerine zest, aromatic herb and a spicy ginger note while tiny, persistent bubbles lend elegance. A bitter almond note closes the finish."
US,90.0,42.0,Monterey County,ChÃ¢teau Julien,"Nice to see such a nice Merlot from ChÃ¢teau Julien, their best ever. It does what Merlot should, being dry and lush, with complex sour cherry, currant, herb, cocoa and spice flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. A lovely wine for drinking now."
France,90.0,13.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,Chateau Mourgues du Gres,"This enchanting rosÃ© starts off slightly flinty and citrusy on the nose, but follows up on the palate with waves of creamy concentration and ripe berry fruit balanced by a bright, refreshing finish."
Italy,91.0,99.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Monte del FrÃ ,"Aromas suggesting resin, mature plum, forest floor, exotic spice, leather and black currant emerge on this solidly structured red. The firm palate offers espresso, raisin, cherry marinated in spirits, fig, licorice and chewing tobacco alongside firm, close-grained tannins that clutch the finish."
US,87.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Ledson,"There's more than a little residual sugar in this soft, sensual Zin, but the wine handles its sweetness well. It's terrifically ripe in blackberry, mulberry, boysenberry and other rustic berry flavors, with lots of spices and vanilla. Drink now."
US,95.0,42.0,Wahluke Slope,Fielding Hills,"Though the blend includes small portions of other grapes??% Syrah, 3% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc?this really champions the essential character of great Washington Cabernet. Its core fruit is supple and compact cassis and black cherry, with a spicy top note that resonates well into the finish. Concentrated and beautifully proportioned, with black olive and just a hint of leaf in the finish."
Italy,94.0,53.0,Chianti Classico,Felsina,"Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, exotic spice, toast and a whiff of new oak. The firm palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed plum, clove and ground pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017??024."
US,93.0,56.0,Santa Barbara County,Pence Ranch,"Red cherries, sagebrush and darkly colored slate elements power the tight nose on this wine from an estate located just east of the Sta. Rita Hills, which owner Blair Pence is trying to expand. The palate shows cracked peppercorns, cranberry-raspberry juice, lots of fresh energy and a decent amount of tannic grip."
US,86.0,50.0,Yakima Valley,Kestrel,"After starting out quite reduced, this wine offers aromas of vanilla, barrel spices, flowers and earth. The flavors show a lot of restraint for the variety but the reduction is hard to get around."
France,87.0,21.0,Beaujolais Blanc,Domaine des Marrans,"While this Chardonnay is rich, it is also well balanced. It offers light spice, rounded yellow fruits and just a touch of minerality to give texture, plus toastiness to add interest. The end brings out the acidity."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Montsant,AcÃºstic,"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body."
US,89.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Brooks,"Juicy fruit flavors carry a pleasantly candied character, dappled with hints of cinnamon and pepper flakes. It's broad and appealing, with a touch of mint enlivening the finish."
Italy,84.0,18.0,Campania,Giuseppe Apicella,"A blend of Tintore and Per'e Palummo (a grape native to the Island of Ischia), there is a thorny, raw quality to this wine that is backed by Asian spice, incense, spice, tobacco and mature black fruit. The wine has a thin, almost metallic taste, with spicy fruit tones on the close."
France,88.0,29.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Louis Max,"A rounded, wood-aged wine, this is full of ripe red-berry and spice flavors, with a core of warm, smoky tannins. It is structured and should age over several years."
US,92.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gordon Estate,"Light golden brown in color, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of brown sugar, dried pineapple, papaya and lychee. A whopping 270.8g/L residual sugar, it's thick, honeyed and sugary sweet with cinnamon, honey and granulated brown sugar flavors that linger on the finish."
Italy,91.0,175.0,Toscana,Le Macchiole,"Made entirely with Syrah, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, French oak, leather and cedar. The full-bodied palate offers cured meat, dried blackberry, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins."
US,86.0,8.0,California,Twisted,"A zippy, lively version, this light-bodied wine smells and tastes like a combo of grapefruit, lemon and peach juices, having a crisp character on first sip, and a rich softness on the second."
France,96.0,575.0,Chambertin Clos de BÃ¨ze,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"Big and bold, this is real Chambertin, a dense mouthful of plum fruit and tannin. It is foursquare, solid but not overbearing, leaving room for a delicious mix of black fruits and power leavened with some acidity. Age this wine for 10 years."
US,88.0,57.0,Russian River Valley,Roadhouse Winery,"Oaky and dense, this wine is sourced from the Nunes Vineyard, a fine site in the heart of the appellation. Raspberry and blueberry jam sway between a juicy midpalate, integrated with the oak and yet toasty, before boasting a vanilla-cherry finish."
US,87.0,80.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Star Lane Vineyard,"Hard to believe this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend is nearly six years old. It's still bitingly tannic. There's a huge core of blackberry and cocoa fruit that's slowly showing aged notes, but those tough tannins will never go away before the fruit fades. Drink up."
France,87.0,20.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Blaignan,"Already an easy, ripe wine, this is fruity, rich and developing well. Its black currant and berry fruits give a sense of freshness, while smoky tannins suggest structure. It's not powerful, but will be very enjoyable. Drink from 2017."
US,93.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Patz & Hall,"A vineyard source since 2004, this Chenoweth is earthy and distinctly intense, rich and robust in blackberry and black cherry with strong elements of black pepper and cinnamon. The acidity is balanced and veering on mineral, with subtle oak on the finish and a rewarding touch of dark chocolate. The density of the tannins suggest further cellaring, through 2020."
US,83.0,26.0,Virginia,Miracle Valley,"This wine smells like an ice cream sundae, with scents of mint-chocolate chip and cookie dough, plus touches of strawberry and cherry sauce. Light to medium bodied, it has a malleable midpalate, but the tannins gain astringency on the finish. As the wine sits in the glass, the fruit seems to fall away, and the palate becomes more brittle feeling."
US,86.0,18.0,Oregon,King Estate,"Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016."
US,87.0,20.0,Red Hills Lake County,Owl Ridge,"This sturdy, well-made wine has lightly charred aromas, tasty cherry flavors and moderate tannins to give the texture some grip."
France,91.0,20.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,"This well-proportioned wine has ripe fruits along with generous texture and acidity. A touch of wood gives extra weight. It's ready to drink, but will be even better by the end of 2014."
France,88.0,15.0,Sainte-Foy Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Champ des Treilles,"From a biodynamic vineyard, this vivid wine reveals great character. The fruit is ripe, smooth, soft, illuminated by flashes of currants, green plums, a wonderful swathe of creaminess. It feels very complete, not intense, but open and ready to drink."
France,85.0,11.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Vircoulon,"This delicious, fruity wine is full of acidity and crisp fruit. Light, bright and dominated by green and citrus fruits, it is ready to drink now."
US,94.0,75.0,Sta. Rita Hills,La Voix,"This new project from Steve and Chrystal Clifton from Palmina and formerly Brewer-Clifton is exciting and tasty. Plump red cherry, fine-grained clove, allspice, nutmeg, sage, kola nut and a touch of chile spice show on the supple but focused nose. Tart cranberry, sour cherry and peppery sage pop on the energetic palate."
US,88.0,36.0,Dry Creek Valley,Phipps,"Coconut, chocolate and coffee make for sweet and savory companions in this mushy, grippy and satisfying wine. Big on power and concentration, it has an underlay of brown sugar."
US,92.0,28.0,Mendocino County,Saracina,"Big and rich, this full-bodied wine has an aroma like the crema on an espresso and abundant dark-fruit flavors. A wonderful, mouthcoating texture keeps the flavors lingering on the finish. The sense of layering and creaminess that extends after a sip is captivating."
US,93.0,175.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Serene,"This lovely, evocative wine celebrates the finesse that characterizes the finest Pinot Noirs. Delicate nuances of bramble, cinnamon, tar and nougat wrap around and weave through a core of black cherry fruit. Ample acidity ensures much life ahead, through at least 2025."
US,90.0,30.0,Sonoma Valley,Gundlach Bundschu,"For whatever the reason, this winery's Bordeaux reds, including Merlot, have shown tremendous improvement over the last few years. This Merlot is soft, sensual and lovely, with cherry pie, red currant, violet, mocha and new French oak flavors. Easy to drink now with robust grilled meats or stews."
US,90.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,K&M;,"Jason Bull makes this wine for the owners, fermenting it in neutral oak that nonetheless yields a rich wine with buttery, toasty, spicy highlights. The light tropical (banana and papaya) fruit is nicely cloaked in butterscotch, with plenty of acidity to buoy it. It's both refreshing and compact, with a drinking window of now through 2020."
US,89.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pacific Rim,"Penetrating aromas suggest lemon oil and citrus blossom, with a hint of terpene. This is the driest version of this wine to date, with residual sugar down around 0.5%. Pear skin, pear flesh and citrus carry it through a lengthy finish."
US,89.0,46.0,Chehalem Mountains,Anam Cara,"The estate reserve gets more new and once-filled oak, and is a selection from vines whose yield has been dropped to 1.5 tons/acre. It's forward and flavorful, with black cherry, coffee and anise components. The entry is smooth and continues so, on through a finish complete with sandalwood and butterscotch."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Terre Siciliane,Caruso & Minini,"This informal red opens with aromas that suggest dark-skinned fruit and Mediterranean brush. The dense, simple palate offers juicy black cherry and a hint of dark cooking spice. It closes on a note of bitter almond."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Alto Adige,Tiefenbrunner,"One of the more structured Pinot Grigios, this opens with aromas that recall white flower, orchard fruit, a whiff of oak and chopped herb. The bright palate offers Kaiser pear, yellow apple, vanilla, candied citrus zest and a ginger note alongside crisp acidity."
US,88.0,55.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Coquelicot,"This traditional blend of 36% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec offers the expected aromas of cedar, plums, tobacco, cracked pepper and slight mint. It's very easy on the palate, with boysenberries and a woody complexity, proving light and tasty."
Australia,86.0,20.0,Adelaide Hills,RockBare,"A solid, well-made Sauvignon Blanc from RockBare that combines aromas of melon rind and underripe nectarine with flavors of stone fruit and citrus, this is a nice wine, albeit not one that solves the mystery of what Austin Powers was missing in The Spy Who Shagged Me."
US,85.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Snoqualmie,"The Naked Riesling is organically farmed and produced. This new vintage already seems a bit tired and has an unusually deep (oxidized?) golden color. It's drinking well enough, like a somewhat aged apple cider, but does not have the sort of freshness that one would hope for in a just-released 2007 wine."
France,89.0,25.0,Saint-Georges-Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Saint-AndrÃ© Corbin,"From an estate that claims to date back to Roman times and has been revived by the current owners, this attractive wine features dusty tannins and ripe, juicy blackberry-flavored Merlot. A touch of perfume and plenty of acidity at the end keep it fresh. Drink from 2017."
US,87.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,VML,"A pretty Sauvignon Blanc, polished and crisp, with a delicate, cleansing mouthfeel, and a dry finish. It has strong flavors of grapefruits, Asian pears and white tobacco, with stimulating spices."
Spain,93.0,110.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Abadia Retuerta,"Dense leather, cola and wild berry aromas comprise the bouquet on this massive, layered, suprememly rich Tempranillo. Core blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors are incredibly ripe, while chocolate and prune flavors carry the finish. This is a thick, dense wine squarely made in the modern style. Drink through 2020."
Spain,92.0,155.0,Jerez,Bodegas Hidalgo,"Only 100 cases of this vintage-designated oloroso were made, and now it smells mature, nutty and oily. A full, elegant palate shows the right weight and acidic cut, while salty flavors of peanut and caramel finish long, nutty and a touch hot due to 22% abv."
Australia,90.0,70.0,Wrattonbully,TapaNappa,"This French-Australian collaboration has turned out a soft, easy-to-drink Merlot with notable complexity. Cassis and black cherry fruit is backed by shadings of cedar and vanilla and eased along by a creamy texture and supple tannins. Without any track record, it's probably prudent to drink this over the next few years."
US,87.0,28.0,North Coast,Stargazer Barn,"Very focused and vibrant, this wine has plenty of good acidity that lends a crisp mouthfeel, along with fresh and buoyant flavors of red cherry and cranberry that are nicely concentrated. Moderate tannins add to the grippy texture, and will make this wine work well with rich foods."
Argentina,85.0,15.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Mild plum and berry aromas are smell a bit like aromatized soap. With cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors, this is a friendly wine without much Pinot character."
US,85.0,28.0,Yorkville Highlands,Meyer Family Cellars,"Solid blackberry, black currant, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors in this dry wine. The grapes come from a small appellation in Mendocino County. It's too soft, lacking structure, but has a certain opulence."
US,90.0,50.0,Oak Knoll District,Corley Reserve,"Ripe apricot, mango and peach flavors mark this flashy Chardonnay. It's dry and oaky, with brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. Don't drink it too cold."
Italy,92.0,29.0,Alto Adige Valle Isarco,Abbazia di Novacella,"This radiant wine opens with heady aromas of white flower, honey, beeswax and citrus zest. The elegant palate shows class and pedigree, offering nectarine, aromatic herb and white stone fruit alongside lively acidity. An energizing mineral note closes the lingering finish."
US,88.0,39.0,Red Mountain,Auclair,"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up equal parts of this blend. Aromas are up front, with notes of baking spice, dates, anise and slightly dried-out fruit. Dark-cherry flavors bring a sense of concentration and enjoyment."
US,87.0,18.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"This is a charming wine?gentle and silky and soft. The pink ""eye of the partridge"" color is especially pretty. The flavors are a fruity and ripe, suggesting strawberries. A great summer wine that will pair well with lots of slightly sweet foods."
US,88.0,20.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Buttonwood,"The expected cut-grass element shows on the nose of this wine from the longtime organic estate, but it also features riper, warmer aromas of nectarine, fragrant lemon skins and a slate minerality. There's lots of energetic pop on the sip, which shows more grass alongside lime juice, pith and skin."
US,86.0,18.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),C.G. di Arie,"A zippy Sierra Foothills SB with pleasing grapefruit and a coating of minerals, this wine has length and lift."
US,92.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage."
France,86.0,25.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"A strangely tart notion persists on the nose. The palate rings with the same strange but faintly red-currant-like aroma. The body is light, fresh and dry and has a clean finish. Drink soon."
US,86.0,24.0,Sierra Foothills,Brooklyn West,"Moderately sweet, this wine has attractive and ripe plum and strawberry aromas, then a soft, plush texture and light, fruity flavors. Made with Barbera, Grenache and Petite Sirah, it tastes sweet and easy to swallow but has plenty of body and alcohol to go with it."
France,92.0,52.0,Beaune,Domaine des Croix,"Made from fruit sourced from a small premier cru that's located next to the famous Clos des Mouches, this is juicy, round and ripe, with a great swathe of soft, fleshy tannins."
Australia,84.0,12.0,Adelaide Plains,Red Earth,"Offers a mishmash of aromas that include plenty of woody notes like vanilla and toast as well as cherry fruit. The result in the mouth comes across as slightly medicinal, with cherry and menthol flavors that turn tangy on the finish. Imported by Walca International."
US,86.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Judd's Hill,JalapeÃ±o and green-bean savory flavor is joined by a freshly cut grass feel in this lively light-bodied white. It is spritzy in acidity and has a taste of just-squeezed lemon.
US,85.0,12.0,Sonoma County,Q,"This is a Cabernet to serve at parties and satisfy people who are looking for something red, dry and full bodied. It's definitely rustic, but has some nice berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors."
Italy,84.0,26.0,Sicilia,Terre di Giurfo,Frappato is usually made as a dry red wine and Terre di Giurfo is probably the first to release a sweet expression of the grape. This ruby-colored dessert wine offers jammy aromas of strawberry and cassis and could pair with almond or pistachio cookies.
US,88.0,33.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Alma Rosa,"Bright in acidity, and powerful in flavor, this Chard oozes ripe pineapple, green apple, mineral, honeysuckle and spicy flavors. Totally dry, it's a little tight, and could develop some bottle complexity in a few years. Nice with Asian fare."
Argentina,83.0,18.0,Uco Valley,Trapiche,Basic black-plum aromas are as good as it gets. This is showing too much acid and not nearly enough stuffing to support it. Scratchy pie cherry and raspberry flavors finish raw and rugged.
US,92.0,32.0,Yakima Valley,Array,"Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling. It's a rich, oily, nutty, buttery style to be sure, but also dense with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit. The acidity buoys it up throughout a strong, long finish."
Italy,90.0,65.0,Chianti Classico,Lornano,"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020."
US,92.0,65.0,Carneros,Donum,"Lovely and lilting, like a cloud in a glass. Shows true Pinot essence in the silky texture and rich flavors of cherries, black raspberries, cola, mocha and pepper spice, firmed and toned with crisp Carneros acidity."
US,90.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Opaque,"A rich sense of earth emerges on this Riboli family wine, with blueberry fruit, leather and roasted beef complementing the loamy character. The palate walks a balanced line between ripe olallieberry fruit and graphite minerality."
US,85.0,14.0,Oregon,Foris,"A spritzy, frizzante style, this is sweet and simple, with a clean flavor of orange."
US,86.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Grgich Hills,"This Chardonnay remains dry and resistant in acids and tannins. The flavors are elusive, suggesting minerals and lemons, with plenty of brisk, citrusy acidity."
US,86.0,19.0,Monticello,Lovingston,"Golden in color, this Petit Manseng (with 10% Seyval Blanc) underwent carbonic maceration, giving it punchy notes of lemon, grapefruit and pineapple rind on the nose and palate. Rich in feel, almost to the point of being flabby, there's just enough acid to maintain balance."
US,90.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,Lobo Hills,"This wine's aromas are quite restrained but include whiffs of red fruit and spice. The palate is light to medium bodied, showing both subtlety and balance. A lovely wine lacking only in aromatic expression."
France,86.0,8.0,CÃ´tes de Bourg,ChÃ¢teau Noblet,"This heavily wood-dominated wine features a dry and tannic texture. It seems lean for the vintage, giving the impression of severity. The fruit shows only in the acidity at the end."
US,85.0,15.0,Monterey County,Irony,"Very dry, crisp and elegantly structured, this Pinot Noir can be had at a pretty good price. It has modest flavors of cherries, tobacco and spices, but is a little unripe, with hints of green tomato and white pepper."
France,90.0,65.0,Bergerac Sec,ChÃ¢teau Tour des Gendres,"This single-parcel wine is rich and with layers of wood aging in the flavor, giving a spicy slightly toasty character. Behind that, there is a more herbal green-fruit character that is crisp with acidity and with a tangy, zesty aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
US,90.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Barons,"The aromas explore Cabernet's greener side, with overt notes of bell pepper along with vanilla and other barrel spices. The black-fruit flavors show richness, with grainy tannins backing them up. This wine is best for those who enjoy the variety's savory aspects."
US,92.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Mi SueÃ±o,"Here's a fine, young Cabernet, rich in pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, cassis and sweet toasted oak notes. Already throwing some sediment, it should glide effortlessly through the next eight years, gaining bottle interest."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Venezie,Masi,"There's a green, brambly quality to this rosÃ© that is enhanced by powdered licorice, dried mint, green tea and cassis. The wine is nice and refreshing but slightly disjointed in places. Made from a 70-30 blend of Refosco and Merlot."
US,86.0,52.0,Paso Robles,Dilecta,"This 100% varietal wine shows its warm-climate origins in the exceptionally ripe cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also quite high in alcohol, which gives it some prickly heat as well as a raisiny, Port-like aftertaste."
France,89.0,35.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Teyssier,"There is great fruit on this ripe, full-bodied wine. The fruit is already well integrated with the tannins, giving a juicy feel and a black currant fragrance. Rich, open and soft, finishing with an elegant structure."
US,90.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gamache,"Champoux and Ciel du Cheval vineyards each make up 40% of this wine, with the balance coming from Gamache. It's locked-up tightly at present with earth, tar, cherry, high-toned herb and barrel-spice aromas leading to focused black-fruit flavors that display elegance and persistence. Give it time to open up."
France,93.0,175.0,Champagne,Boizel,"Fermented and aged in wood before bottling, this is now a mature wine. It shows some signs of oak, although the toasty flavors have now merged with those of aging. The result is a rich wine, with almond, spice and acidity mingling well together. Drink now."
Italy,95.0,65.0,Barolo,Pio Cesare,"Pio Cesare and the 2007 vintage marry beautifully to produce a layered, opulent, textured, rich wine that is bursting with zesty red fruit, sassy spice, leather and toasted espresso bean. What really sets this wine apart is the dense smoothness of its texture. Save this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more."
US,85.0,15.0,Old Mission Peninsula,Bowers Harbor,"Green apple with a squeeze of fresh lemon makes for a basic and easy unoaked Chardonnay. While standard and simple, this is a perfectly enjoyable wine to pair with lighter fare."
France,88.0,18.0,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,With pink hints from the skins of the Pinot Gris this wine has honey and canned apricot syrup flavors. The spice and acidity complement each other at the end of this attractive wine.
US,97.0,625.0,Napa Valley,Yao Ming,"The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, crÃ¨me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years."
Italy,83.0,26.0,Chianti Classico,Castellare,"Shows unexpected age, with brown around the edges and mature prune and orange-peel aromas. The flavors are more alive, but are not vibrant. Rather dull on the finish, this isn't bad wine but tastes like something four or five years older."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Velona,"Aromas of leafy underbrush, espresso, grilled porcini mushroom and dark berry take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers dried cherry, coffee beans and savory herbs but the midpalate is a bit hollow."
France,91.0,50.0,Madiran,ChÃ¢teau de Gayon,"In this ripe, smooth wine, the fruit dominates the tannic structure. Black fruits, dense plums and blackberry flavors are rich and concentrated. The firmer underlay is dark, brooding and promises good aging. This is not a shy wine and it will also need aging, so drink from 2018."
Italy,88.0,39.0,Chianti Classico,La Castellina,"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this opens with earthy aromas of truffle, scorched earth, violet and a touch of dark spice. The palate offers dried black cherry and ground pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. It also shows the heat of the vintage, so drink soon."
US,90.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"At David Hill, the Winemakers CuvÃ©e is a cut above the reserve. It's a muscular blend of scents and flavors of lavender, cherry and chocolate wrapped into a firm, focused finish."
US,91.0,19.0,Mendocino County,Graziano,"An unusual level of flavor concentration and density of texture make this wine substantive in mouthfeel, intriguing in depth, and a good wine to age for a few years. It has touches of sage and sweet oak in the aroma, plus full-bore flavors of blackberry and black cherry on the palate. With great structure due to firm tannins and acidity, it will be best to drink after 2019."
US,92.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sleight of Hand,"A blend of fruit from Lewis Vineyard, Les Collines and Stoney Vine, this wine offers aromas of cherry, blackberry, earth, licorice, smoked meat, violets and herb. The flavors are dense are pure, bringing a pleasing mouthfeel and a long cherry-filled finish."
US,89.0,24.0,Lodi,Fields Family,"This has oodles of ripe boysenberry and huckleberry in the aroma, and the overt fruitiness continues in the flavors. A nice touch of oak sawdust in the aroma comes off more like a touch of sweetness in the flavors. There is a rich mouthfeel, soft tannins and full body. It's enjoyable and easy to drink."
US,91.0,65.0,Red Mountain,Force Majeure,"Exuberant aromas of espresso, smoke and dark fruit leap up from the glass. The palate is considerably more reserved with fruit and earth flavors that linger."
Australia,83.0,17.0,Coonawarra,Hollick,"Slightly over the top and disjointed, the sweet honey, butterscotch, toast and baked Golden Delicious aromas and flavors at war with powerful acids. The elements are all here, just not working together."
US,92.0,175.0,Rutherford,Staglin,"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins. But the price is challenging. If you choose to buy and cellar, the wine should develop at least for several years."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,ValdellÃ¶vo,"White flowers, green apple, pear, lime and mineral notes come together on this linear, lightly sparkling wine. Refermenting in the bottle on its yeasts gives it a slightly cloudy appearance and a fine sediment at the bottom. It has a dry, almost austere finish."
Spain,80.0,14.0,CariÃ±ena,Campo Marin,"Sweet red fruit aromas have a chemical artificiality to them. The palate is underdeveloped, thin and tastes medicinal. Drying and hollow on the finish."
Australia,90.0,62.0,Heathcote,Occam's Razor,"This is a herbaceous expression of Shiraz from the under appreciated Heathcote region of Victoria, and made by Emily Laughton, daughter of the well-regarded Jasper Hill family. Mint and green herbs mingle with potpourri, juicy fruit, and charred oak characters. Tannins are tightly wound at the moment, but the wine is well balanced and here for the long haul. Drink 2020??032."
US,86.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,King Estate,"This young wine has tart, rather thin fruit flavors of pomegranate and wild berry. There's ample acidity?maybe too ample for some tasters. Flavors seems to fall off and fade quickly."
France,89.0,120.0,Champagne,Vranken,"A rich rosÃ©, edging towards dryness. The wine is full of fresh crushed strawberries and red apple flavors, showing the ripeness of the year yet keeping a sense of elegance and tight structure."
Spain,88.0,22.0,Bierzo,Abad Dom Bueno,"This comes across a bit dilute on the nose, with aromas of green melon and underripe banana. The palate shows good weight, balance and a lightly oily texture. Minerally flavors of nectarine and peach finish solid, with lasting acidity providing support."
US,92.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Morell-Lawrence,"Coming from Lawrence Vineyards, this wine offers aromas of orange peel, smoke, olive, blueberry, blackberry and wood spice. The blue-fruit flavors are full bodied and perfumed, showing a pleasing sense of balance and a lingering finish."
Australia,87.0,45.0,Clarendon,Clarendon Hills,"The 2007 Hickinbotham features attractive scents of ground spices, leather and red cherries, but doesn't seem to have the richness and depth of CH's other Grenaches this year. Tart cherry-berry fruit fades into finely textured tannins on the finish. Drink now??015."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Bardolino,Corte Fornello,"Strawberry, white pepper and blue flower aromas segue over to the bright palate along with juicy wild cherry and a hint of clove. It's straightforward and savory, with smooth tannins. Drink soon."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Terre Siciliane,Barone Montalto,"Aromas of cedar, allspice and black-skinned fruit take shape in the glass. On the easygoing palate, notes of ground pepper and star anise add some depth to the juicy blackberry core, while chewy tannins give it texture. Drink through 2016."
France,93.0,75.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Latour Ã  Pomerol,"In 2000, this was still the property of Lily Lacoste, who also owned PÃ©trus. Latour Ã  Pomerol was sold  in 2001 to a Catholic charity. The management, then and now, is with the Moueix family who make the most of the fabulous vineyard. The 2000 is a hugely opulent, velvet textured wine, but it retains hints of the elegance that is the hallmark of this property."
France,86.0,16.0,Hautes CÃ´tes de Nuits,Nuiton-Beaunoy,"Light, fragrant, and structured, this shows a smoky flavor and refreshing red-berry fruit. It's lively and fruity, and the tannins are in the background."
France,91.0,40.0,Gaillac,Domaine Rotier,"Ame means the spirit, the soul, and Alain Rotier believes this wine expresses the true nature of his Gaillac estate. On that basis, it's a place of great perfumes, coming through in the wine from wood as well as chunky black fruits. It is a relatively soft wine, the concentration in the dense fruit rather than the tannins."
France,95.0,312.0,Charmes-Chambertin,Roche de Bellene,"As always with a grand cru from Gevrey-Chambertin, this wine shows immense power. It is dominated by black fruits as well as signs of the 60% wood aging. Behind, the red cherry fruits are developing along with the lively acidity. It needs to age and should not be drunk before 2019."
US,87.0,16.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"Glimmers of saline, nuts and smoke add dimension to the sweet apple and lemon flavors. Brisk with acidity, it has a bright, refreshing profile overall. Drink now."
US,90.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Ardor,"Very light in color, this wine brings appealing aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, orange peel, herb, earth and sauvage. The palate is ethereally light and delicate, showing pleasing nuances, with plenty of floral flavors on the finish."
US,87.0,40.0,Chehalem Mountains,Dion,"This is already showing the changes in aroma and color that usually accompany a much older wine. It's drinking quite well, with mature flavors of strawberry fruit pastry, lightly dusted with baking spices. The score reflects its limited aging potential, as the window for enjoyment seems already to be closing."
US,90.0,59.0,Napa Valley,Pine & Brown,"For this classic, restrained Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot, the grapes were grown in Rutherford, Yountville and St. Helena. The wine is juicy in soft red cherry and cassis. Seamless on the palate, it offers a nice progression from explosive fruit to measured acidity and low oak, the finish balanced between all three."
France,85.0,18.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Sours,"A ripe, red-fruited wine with a rich character, this offers vanilla as well as citrus and berry fruit flavors. It is just off dry, fresh and brightly fruity. It makes for a delicious, crisp summer rosÃ©."
France,86.0,14.0,CÃ´tes de Bourg,ChÃ¢teau Laroche Joubert,"Firm, closed wine that exhibits a strong tannin character. The wine is powerful and dense, its black plum fruits lying under the dry structure. There is a touch of alcohol burn?a shame in an otherwise well-made wine."
Italy,87.0,40.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Cantina Sociale della Valpantena,"This has aromas of raisin, fig and espresso. The palate shows blackberry, prune and evident oak flavors, with a hint of carob. This shows the heat of the vintage, with evolved tannins and rather low acidity, so drink soon."
US,94.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Walt,"Bob's is the producer's estate vineyard, acquired in 2014, a foggy site near the Petaluma Gap. Here, it allows for fleshy flavors of pear, brioche and honey, offering ripeness within a classic structure of minerality. Intense in tension and body, it has a dark color and a lingering tease of honeycomb."
US,90.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pondera,"Aromas of raspberry, coffee, herbs, smoke and baking spices are austere on the nose. The fruit and barrel flavors are bright and tart, showing a lot of polish, detail and length."
US,90.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Paraduxx,"Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two. Black pepper, clove and leathery cigar fuel a high-powered succulence of black and red fruit accented by a smoky drawl."
France,91.0,16.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Ollivier FrÃ¨res,"This is a yellow fruit and spice flavored wine. It is rich, just cut with acidity and with rounded fruit flavors and a generous texture. It is an impressive development from a young, crisp Muscadet and shows how well some wines from the region can age. Drink now."
Australia,95.0,85.0,Heathcote,Jasper Hill,"When the alcohol levels are reined in to appropriate levels, this can be one of Australia's top Shiraz. The 2012 is a stunning example of balance and finesse, combining youthful scents of cassis and toasty oak with floral elements. There's ample weight and texture yet silky elegance at the same time, while already complex notes of orange pekoe and black currant are sure to gain even more with five or 10 years of cellaring. Drink 2020??030."
France,89.0,19.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine Dubost,"Good balance between crisp lemon acidity and ripe yellow fruits gives this wine a rich, fresh character that is delicious and stylish. Working from vineyards In the family for more than 100 years, the current producer, Jean-Paul Dubost, says ?wine is never made by chance.??Drink now."
France,92.0,66.0,Champagne,Deutz,"This pale rosÃ© is showing its maturity at seven years of age, its fruitiness transforming into extra richness, with touches of toast. It's a very fine wine, ripe and ready to drink."
US,94.0,40.0,Santa Maria Valley,Byron,"A brilliant wine, massively sculpted and monumental, that shows how great this vineyard is. The wine shows densely concentrated flavors of blackberries and licorice, with the loveliest accent of sweet worn leather and rhubarb, flourished with the dusty spices that always characterize a fine Santa Maria Pinot Noir. Best now??013."
US,90.0,30.0,Carneros,Truchard,"Lots of new oak brings buttered toast flavors to this Chardonnay. Sur lees aging adds notes of sour cream. The underlying fruit veers toward intensely flavored green apples and limes. Tasted in January, the components haven't come together. Give it until the fall of 2013."
US,94.0,95.0,Sonoma Coast,Williams Selyem,"Brambly red cherry and strawberry are featured among shy layers of oak, providing the wine with an interesting duality of power and silkiness on the palate. A complex streak of minerality makes this intriguingly seductive and exotic, with layers of flavor unfolding with each sip."
France,91.0,33.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Bailly-Lapierre,"A classic blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this has a steely texture, fresh acidity and lively flavors of sliced apple and citrus with a tangy orange zest texture. It is bright and a bit taught now, so give it a little time to harmonize; try in 2015."
US,85.0,20.0,Red Mountain,Michael Florentino,"Sourced principally from the excellent Artz vineyard on Red Mountain, this blend of 78% Sauvignon Blanc and 22% SÃ©millon is ripe and lush, almost to the point of tasting sweet. No residual sugar was listed, but in terms of flavor, it's hard to ignore. If you like that richness, there is a creamy, milk-and-honey flavor, along with toasty notes."
US,84.0,24.0,Mendocino County,Saracina,"Refreshing and zesty, with peach, grass, juniper berry and grapefruit flavors that drink a little sweet, although crisp acidity cleanses and soothes the palate. This nice cocktail wine is fun and easy to drink."
US,88.0,20.0,Washington,Wind Rose,"Barbera makes up just over half of this wine, with the rest Primitivo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo and Dolcetto. Aromas of vanilla, wood spice and red cherry are followed by a tart lick of cherry and cranberry flavors."
US,90.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,Left Coast Cellars,"This 100% Dijon-clone bottling offers a bold mix of peach, banana and pineapple. It's fruit-driven from top to bottom, with supporting acids to keep it fresh and invigorating."
France,87.0,17.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Calavon,"Visually, this is a pale version of a Creamsicle. It has citrus yellow fruits and soft acidity. With its spice, it is well balanced, ending with a refreshing burst of bright red-currant flavors."
Italy,85.0,18.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,Nicolis,"This edition of Nicolis' Valpolicella blend shows simplicity, but cleanliness and balance as well. It's a straightforward expression with lingering tones of cherry and cola on the close."
France,88.0,32.0,Sauternes,Fleur de Charme,"This honeyed wine from a good Sauternes year is rich. Touches of botrytis give it a dry edge and stop it from being cloying. In the background, the acidity finishes with a lift. Drink from 2018."
France,89.0,19.0,Chiroubles,Georges Duboeuf,"With ripe fruits and balanced tannins, this wine is developing well. It has generous berry flavors, ripe black currants and refreshing acidity. The tannins are still prominent and need to soften. Drink from late 2016."
US,84.0,8.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Aromas of black currant, dark chocolate and herb are followed by lightly concentrated dark-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a sense of astringency."
France,95.0,279.0,EchÃ©zeaux,Domaine Faiveley,"Firmly structured, this dark wine has smoky tannins and intense acidity combined in a texture that is dusty, almost dry at the core. Over this the ripe red fruits are spread thickly, giving a powerful concentrated wine that will age well. Drink from 2022."
US,93.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,MacPhail,"This is a substantial, complete and well-balanced wine with a deep red color and brickish rim. Intensely fruity and spicy aromas incorporate elegant oak nuances, black cherries, nutmeg and cinnamon, leading to generous, ripe flavors and a smooth, velvety texture. It's quite complex and delicious."
US,85.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Viszlay Vineyards,"Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine shows an earthy underbelly of lemon met by more nuanced vanilla."
France,92.0,80.0,Vosne-RomanÃ©e,Manuel Olivier,"Old vines give this single-parcel wine its power and concentration. Long wood aging hasn't diminished the richness of the fruit, the juicy acidity and the succulent berry flavors. It's a wine that's full and structured, likely to age well. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Bynum,"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety."
France,89.0,15.0,Fleurie,Mommessin,"A very complete wine, firm but flattering on the palate. A mix of cherry skins, red plums and lovely juiciness all come together in an harmonious whole."
France,88.0,23.0,Bandol,Les Vignobles Gueissard,"While the wine is dry from the austere tannins, it also has a core of ripe berry fruits that are laced with acidity. It should develop some more and the tannins will soften, although they will always be very present. Drink from early 2018."
US,91.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ott & Murphy,"This blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, MourvÃ¨dre and Viognier offers intriguing aromas of blackberry and plum with woodspice accents. It's pleasingly fresh and pure with rich, focused fruit flavors that linger."
US,95.0,32.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Teroldego Rotaliano,Cavit,"Teroldego is a fantastic red grape located in select areas of northern Italy. This expression opens with aromas of hearty blackberry, savory spice, leather, prune and tobacco. It finishes bright, bold and spicy."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Vignamaggio,"A blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this opens with aromas that recall red currant, cedar and rose petal. The savory palate doles out wild cherry, white pepper, cinnamon and aniseed alongside polished tannins."
US,92.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Black Cordon,"Round and lush, this offers soft layers of vanilla, French toast and tarte Tatin. Expansive on the palate, it maintains acidity and a freshness that keeps it inviting in the glass, concocting appealing aromas of lemon chiffon."
France,88.0,23.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Tour d'Horable,"This beautifully perfumed wine offers spicy Cabernet Franc notes and ripe red berry flavors. The tannins are still firm while not masking the spice, smokiness and blackberry fruit. For medium-term aging, from 2020."
Italy,93.0,77.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Masi,"Wild berry, leather, tobacco, tilled earth, aromatic herb and floral aromas meld together on this impressive red. The full-bodied structured palate delivers black cherry marinated in spirits, dried plum, chocolate and licorice alongside a backbone of firm velvety tannins. Drink 2018??026."
Spain,84.0,9.0,Alicante,Bocopa,"Slightly grassy raspberry and plum aromas suggest oyster shell. This is drawing and a bit abrasive, with lightly herbal and generic red-fruit flavors. It's dry in feel and lightly bitter in flavor on the finish."
US,86.0,50.0,Virginia,Barboursville Vineyards,"Intriguing aromas of lingonberry, dried herb, strawberry-fruit leather and sarsaparilla are layered and dark. On the palate, the wine feels refined, with a malleable core that's framed by dry, textured tannins."
Italy,91.0,66.0,Barolo,Marcarini,"The La Serra cru lies right above Cerequio and offers a glorious panoramic view of the town of Barolo. Poderi Marcarini has a long association with this vineyard and has carefully harnessed the natural aromatic intensity of the fruit grown here. Blackberry, cassis and raspberry are enhanced by spice and vanilla. It's a tight, firm wine. Drink after 2018."
US,87.0,22.0,Dundee Hills,Winter's Hill,"Made by the saignÃ©e process, where the juice is bled from the principal ferment to concentrate the Pinot Noir, this rosÃ© is blocky and simple. Light flavors of strawberry and cherry are finished dry and fade quickly. Drink this well chilled before the next vintage appears."
US,90.0,32.0,Southern Oregon,DanCin,"This wine utilizes 40% neutral oak, 40% stainless steel and 20% new French barrels, and is fermented with native yeast. It's a deep, vibrant gold color, sporting sexy aromas of pineapple, pear and peach. The palate is fully ripe, round and forward, with luscious fruit flavors throughout."
US,85.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mercer,"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer."
US,86.0,19.0,Paso Robles,Cirque du Vin,"Dried cherries, dried blueberries, fudge and licorice combine into a silky, sexy nose on this blend of 60% Syrah, 28% Petite Sirah, 5% Zinfandel, 3% Merlot, 2% Malbec and 2% Tannat. The palate is sleek though thin, with light boysenberry, dark slate and hints of vanilla."
France,93.0,32.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"The steep Monts DamnÃ©s Vineyard is one of the top sites in Sancerre. It has produced a wine that is both concentrated and aromatically fruity. It is stylish and full of acidity, with white fruits and tight structure. Ready for aging over several years."
France,86.0,23.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Ruhlmann,"In this soft, ripe wine, red fruits are balanced by acidity, while the gentle texture marries well with the light mousse. It's immediately attractive with its fresh aftertaste."
US,89.0,26.0,Livermore Valley,Longevity,"the bright gold color of this flavorful and full-bodied wine catches attention. On the palate it delivers white chocolate, butter and lemon flavors that are rich yet lightly tangy, giving the wine good balance."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,"Supple and inviting, this mellow take on Cabernet Franc has soft cherry-pie flavors, a dash of pepper, and a smooth, chocolaty finish, with a pleasant, toasty, caramel aftertaste."
France,90.0,55.0,Beaune,Jaffelin,"Rich, round and complex, this is full of ripe red-berry flavors. The acidity drives the solid tannins and firm structure. The wine has the approachability of Beaune, but it can also be aged for 4?? years."
US,90.0,16.0,California,Noceto,"Like taking in a fresh bouquet of flowers just in bloom, this deliciously crafted Moscato Frivolo, slightly fizzy and superlatively refreshing, is a lovely surprise at just 7% alcohol and $16. Start your night off with a glass or let it guide you through a meal, serve cold and take in its candied orange and jasmine amidst the bubbles."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Uco Valley,Finca El Origen,"This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time."
Italy,99.0,235.0,Bolgheri Sassicaia,Tenuta San Guido,"One of Italy's most iconic bottlings, the 2012 Sassicaia is drop-dead gorgeous. A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc, it boasts sensations of blue flowers, cedar, juicy red currants, ripe raspberries, white pepper and a balsamic note. Structured, radiant and loaded with finesse, it delivers everything you'd expect from a world-class wine and more. Drink 2018??032."
US,86.0,24.0,Sonoma Coast,Schug,"Sharp in acidity and bone dry, this is a good, everyday Pinot Noir. It shows a properly silky texture, and flavors of cola, cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now."
US,91.0,50.0,Yakima Valley,Ardor,"Initially quite light aromatically, this wine opens with notes of cherry candy and raspberry that reveal themselves over time. The cherry and cranberry flavors are medium bodied, showing good length. It's a pretty, very understated wine."
US,92.0,52.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"At two-plus years this Pinot Noir still is an infant. It's a swirl of new toasty oak, ripe cherries and currants, acidity and fresh, chunky tannins. It's a pity that much of it will be opened too young. Should be more harmonious toward the end of 2009, and evolve for many years after."
France,87.0,32.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine FranÃ§ois Schmitt,"A very shy nose leads onto a fresh palate where frothy bubbles reveal a hint of tart red-currant fruit and fresh citrus. The body is very light and dry, but has a zesty, mouthwatering finish."
France,86.0,26.0,Mercurey,Vignerons de Buxy,"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink."
US,87.0,18.0,Monterey County,Carmel Road,"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast."
US,87.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Russian Hill,"Textbook RRV Pinot Noir, a red wine for Cab and Merlot lovers who want to graduate to this great grape. Dry and full-bodied, it actually has some pronounced tannins, with currant and bitter cherry skin flavors and darker, complex notes of pine sap, balsamic and black pepper."
US,87.0,30.0,Sonoma County,Deerfield,"Dry and herbal, with tobacco, thyme and cedar flavors, and an island of wild blackberries floating in the middle. The considerable tannins make the wine astringent. Probably at its best for the next few years."
France,90.0,15.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"The rosy floral overtones of Muscat are very evident on the fragrant nose. The palate, on the other hand, gives us the texture of Pinot Gris and the freshness of Riesling while floral nuances hover and swirl. This is a lovely blend of all that Alsace does well. Friendly and fresh with a dry finish."
Italy,93.0,42.0,Barbaresco,Rizzi,"Chopped herb, fragrant blue flower, woodland berry and menthol aromas take center stage in this vibrant red. On the palate, clove and star anise notes underpin red cherry, cranberry and tobacco flavors. A hint of orange zest marks the finish while refined tannins and bright acidity provide the framework."
Italy,91.0,65.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Brunelli Martoccia,"This dark garnet colored Brunello opens with straightforward and uncomplicated aromas of wild berry, spice and leather. This wine also shows a high level of confidence that is seen in its firm tannins, crisp acidity and rich aftertaste of clove and black fruit."
France,93.0,40.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Ripe luscious pear fruit almost has a touch of maple syrup on the nose. The palate, which still has ample carbon dioxide from the fermentation for a little fizz, is light and fresh, lemony and bouncy, alive with a kind of earthy goodness. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the dry refreshing palate and makes for a lip-smacking finish."
US,87.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Auclair,"Aromas of barrel spice, dried green herb, dried fruit and game lead to quite sweet black-cherry flavors, with gamy notes on the finish. It seems a bit dried out."
France,88.0,14.0,Bordeaux,Vignobles Raymond,"Bordeaux has always had Malbec in its vineyards although it is rare. This unusual wine shows how, in a fruity year, the grape can work well. The tannins are soft, giving a juicy black-fruited wine that is forward and delicious to drink now for its succulent fruit."
US,91.0,32.0,Sierra Foothills,Tanner,"A wonderful bouquet, like that of a well-aged wine, helps this spicy, fruity bottling stand out. It has gorgeous floral, tamarind and cola aromas, generous fruity flavors and a smooth, lightly tannic texture. An unusual and delicious twist on the variety."
US,91.0,16.0,Napa-Amador,Villa Mt. Eden,"This two-region Zin is from Atlas Peak and Amador County. It shows a really great Zin quality in the leathery spiciness that accompanies the berry flavors, and in the smooth, polished tannins. Amador seems to bring wildness, while Napa brings elegance. The result is a great Zinfandel at a great price."
Italy,85.0,8.0,Sicilia,Feudo Arancio,"This luminous, hay-colored Grillo imparts measured notes of banana and exotic fruit that add extra richness and dimension to what is a simple and easy-drinking white wine overall. You could pair this wine with a long list of seafood, vegetable and pasta recipes?and you can't beat this low price."
US,91.0,40.0,Red Mountain,Soos Creek,"Hailing from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (33%) and Cabernet Franc. Jammy aromas of red and black fruit and licorice lead to plush but well-balanced flavors that linger."
US,88.0,16.0,California,Zepaltas,"Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah combine for a tasty package that's budget-minded to boot. Opening with an intense earthiness and layers of tart cherry, it also offers brambly, gamy meatiness and a finish of black pepper. The majority of the grapes are Grenache, but the wine is as marked by the anise and earthiness of the MourvÃ¨dre as anything else."
US,86.0,35.0,Paso Robles,Imagery,"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal."
US,90.0,50.0,North Fork of Long Island,Paumanok,"This is elegantly perfumed with notes of waxy white blossom, tangerine, honey and lemon zest set against a thin veil of lanolin. Paumanok's late-harvest Riesling is intensely concentrated and complex on both the nose and palate. Striking lemon-lime acidity balances the rich, honeyed sweetness and extends onto the long, floral finish."
US,96.0,135.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit?âespecially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge."
US,88.0,16.0,Lake County,Bonterra,"Good price for a zesty, sweet dessert wine. It's a nice way to finish dinner over something with white and yellow fruit, vanilla and custard ingredients. Shows rich, honeyed orange, apricot and honey flavors, with tingly acidity."
US,86.0,16.0,Leelanau Peninsula,Verterra,"There's a blanket of dusty-pollen over notions of underripe peach and green apple on the nose. The initial shock of citrus on the palate turns to juicy peach tones that ultimately turn sour. Bridging on the sweeter side of the dry category, this would be an easy quaff as an apÃ©ritif."
France,91.0,35.0,Alsace,Bott FrÃ¨res,"While this wine does have sweetness, its great character comes from its structure and spiciness. It is rich, full in the mouth, ripe and concentrated. Even at four years old, it is youthful and closed still, and needs some time in the cellar. Drink from 2015."
Spain,89.0,48.0,Yecla,Bodega Trenza,"Raisiny, reduced aromas of baked fruits suggest overripeness. On a weighty palate this is saturated like the nose, but not overdone. Stewed black-fruit flavors are chocolaty, while this is extracted enough to leave a coating of black-fruit residue on your cheeks, tongue and teeth."
Italy,91.0,38.0,Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,Col Vetoraz Spumanti,"This luminous sparkler has a sweet, fruit-forward nose of cool white peach, sliced banana and cherry blossoms. There's a very slight note of green grass and more distinguishable mineral tones that add depth and personality. In the mouth it has a creamy, soft texture and vibrant fruit flavors."
Italy,88.0,164.0,Toscana,Argiano,"This expression of Sangiovese is dominated by wood-driven sensations. It opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso and underbrush that carry through to the palate alongside a dense black-fruit flavor that stays just behind the oak. It finishes on an astringent, tannic note."
US,92.0,25.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Roblar,"This is a great example of what most would consider a straight-ahead and delicious California Chardonnay. The nose offers aromas of seared pineapple cake, vanilla soda and Meyer lemon, and the palate blends all of the typical elements: lemon juice acidity down the middle, minerality driven by slate and white rocks, apple and a bit of brown spice on the edges."
Italy,85.0,12.0,Collio,CormÃ²ns,"This simple Pinot Grigio offers some amber-golden highlights and aromas of peach, citrus and ash. The wine is clean and zippy in the mouth and works well with appetizers or as a cocktail selection."
US,96.0,110.0,Napa Valley,Kendall-Jackson,"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least."
US,91.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Buttonwood,"A bright touch of candied strawberry shows prominently on the nose of this bottling, with judicious hints of roasted red pepper, herb and peppercorn hiding behind that vivacious veil. The palate is light in body but has plenty of structure to hold up its cranberry and strawberry flavors and peppery spice. Great with a slight chill."
US,91.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Jean Edwards,"A big, firm 100% Cab, rich in blackberry jam and black currant flavors, enriched with lots of sweet, smoky oak. It's made in the modern cult style of soft approachability. It might age, but seems best now for sheer luxury."
US,91.0,40.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Evening Land,"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent."
US,88.0,65.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Tantara,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from a vineyard often known for subtlety packs in a ton of power and darkness, starting with hefty blackberry, tree bark and sarsaparilla on the nose. Tart black-plum-skin flavors kick off the big palate, which grabs attention but is a little clumsy at this stage of life. Patience may bring cohesion."
US,92.0,42.0,Ballard Canyon,Stolpman,"Smooth and sultry purple fruit and flower notes get more specific on the black pepper and blackberry elements in this bottling from the family's original blocks, planted in 1992 and 1993. The palate is both dynamic and straightforward, with nuanced blueberry-blackberry fruits decorated by peppery spice that dances across solid structure into the long finish."
Italy,88.0,50.0,Barolo,Terre da Vino,"This opens with aromas of toast, spicy plum, espresso, leather and mocha. The one-dimensional palate offers dried black cherry, coffee bean and vanilla alongside drying tannins. Drink through 2019."
France,85.0,7.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Calvet,"Lime, fig and taffy flavors mark this successful light white. There is even a bit of subtlety in the chalk and spice notes on the back end, and a slight honey note from the 35% SÃ©millon in the blend makes this a very clean and attractive wine at the price."
Spain,82.0,15.0,Bierzo,Encanto,"This leads with harsh, stunted aromas of earthy berry fruits and rubber. The palate is equally stunted and rough in feel, while tarry, gritty berry flavors finish drawing."
Argentina,84.0,8.0,Mendoza,Casa de Campo,"The bouquet on this is so neutral there's almost nothing to describe. This is zesty and tangy in the mouth, with pithy orange, lemon and green apple flavors. A crisp finish with citrus zest leaves a clean final impression."
US,92.0,27.0,California,Quady,"This fortified wine is made in a Port style by a California producer who has mastered the craft of fermenting Portuguese grape varieties over several decades. It is sweet and fortified, but also elegant, well balanced and not cloying. Nicely concentrated plum and chocolate flavors lead to a vivid, lingering finish."
US,92.0,27.0,Napa Valley,Cameron Hughes,"This is a seriously good Cabernet, and the price makes it a relative bargain. Dry and tannic, it has complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, blueberries and plenty of new smoky oak. A tangy minerality lifts it above the ordinary. It will hold in the bottle until at least 2020."
Italy,91.0,200.0,Etna,Frank Cornelissen,"With the hand-painted word ?Magma??across the front of the bottle, there's no mistaking this wine as a child of Sicily's menacing Mt. Etna. The wine (this is the 6th edition made) showcases bright fruit flavors with raisiny overtones of plum and prune. It ends on a dusty mineral note."
US,90.0,38.0,Yakima Valley,Robert Ramsay,"A solid, earthy, dusty, lightly leathery Cabernet Sauvignon. Though perhaps not technically perfect, it captures the palate imagination with texture and detail, and a light touch which keeps the alcohol around 14% and the tannins proportionate. No massive new oak here either, though the (virtually impossible to read) back label notes that it was made in 100% French oak, half of it new."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Fog Head,"Drink this Merlot with burgers at a party. It's dry and tannic, with some satisfying black currant, licorice and green tea flavors."
Italy,87.0,32.0,Roero,Giovanni Almondo,"The aromas are tight and nervous with notes of wild berry, ginger and licorice. It is firmly astringent, so give it a few more years to help soften the tannins."
US,90.0,19.0,Sonoma County,Matanzas Creek,"A fine, bone-dry and minerally Sauvignon Blanc to enjoy with shellfish, grilled chicken or on its own as an appetizer. A touch of oak adds richness to the vibrant, acidic citrus fruit, lemongrass and green apple flavors."
France,90.0,23.0,Morgon,Domaine de Leyre-Loup,"Powerful, rich and chunky wine. It has the ripest jammy plum and crushed strawberry fruit, along with a serious tannic structure. Just approaching drinkability, its texture is now refreshed with delicious fruit."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Toscana,Tenuta San Giorgio,"This is an attractive 50-50 blend of Cab and Syrah with thick, lush notes of sweet vanilla, black pepper and ripe cherry. It takes a modern, New World approach and stands on its own in terms of complexity and persistence; it's clean and fresh in the mouth with polished tannins."
France,90.0,22.0,Alsace,Emile Beyer,"Lifted chamomile joins riper pear and apple fruit on the nose of this wine. On the concentrated palate these are joined by lemon and grapefruit zest in an unapologetically bracing style. This wine is clean, dry, fresh and totally lip-smacking with the full force of citrus behind it."
US,93.0,33.0,Sierra Foothills,Chacewater,"Simply delicious, this Zin is well mannered and not too full bodied. Aromas of this dry and elegant wine are like cinnamon and cardamom, and flavors are a little smoky and full of cherries. The mouthfeel is good and gripping due to fine tannins and supportive acidity."
France,90.0,22.0,Alsace,Willm,"With its ripe and perfumed character, the wine is not quite dry. It's already maturing, with its fruity acidity muted by almonds, ripe pear skins and a tight, mineral texture. This intense wine will be ready by 2015."
Italy,86.0,12.0,Taburno,Ocone,Playful aromas of sweet fruit and watermelon candy open the nose of this bright Piedirosso wine. It's smooth and easygoing in the mouth and would pair with grilled sausage or lamb chops.
US,88.0,36.0,Alexander Valley,Sbragia,"Intensely built, this is a big-boned and richly layered wine, dense and ripe in blackberry jam. The fruit is joined by smoky oak and further flavors of chocolate-covered coconut."
US,86.0,9.0,California,Redtree,"This value-minded selection blends plenty of bright citrus and apple flavors with good acidity and a hint of sweetness for a complete and pleasing package. It is medium bodied, light on its feet and refreshing. Enjoy now."
US,91.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"This bottling from esteemed producer Williams Selyem is a rich, concentrated wine, brimming with savory flavors of wild cherries and raspberries, red currants, milk chocolate, cloves and black pepper. The extraordinary tannins are smooth and as fine as velvet."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Franciacorta,Castello Bonomi,"A blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Nero, this offers aromas of white stone fruit and toasted bread crust. The palate delivers mature Golden Delicious apple, hazelnut and a hint of candied tangerine. A refined perlage provides the backdrop."
US,84.0,40.0,Sonoma Valley,Petroni,"Too sweet and soft, like a confection in a glass. Tastes like a raspberry and cherry tart, spiced with cinnamon and dusted with cocoa, and turns hot and Porty-like on the finish."
Italy,84.0,20.0,Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio,Digi Or,"The nose here is very sweet and ripe and recalls mature pear, cantaloupe and grapefruit. A blend of Coda di Volpe and 20% Falanghina harvested from the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, the wine offers a smooth but lean consistency and power in the mouth with long-lasting freshness on the close."
US,92.0,65.0,Red Mountain,Upchurch,"Aromas of coffee, graphite, herb, barrel spice and black fruit lead to a power-packed palate full of dark fruit and earth flavors supported by chewy tannins. It's a classic Red Mountain style, not shy but delivering the goods with a long life ahead of it."
Spain,91.0,31.0,Ribera del Duero,Resalte,"Smoky, dark aromas of blackberry, vanilla, licorice and toast introduce a palate with verve, power and balance. Flavors of ripe blackberry and boysenberry are toasty and dark, then fig and mocha flavors take over on the finish. Drink through 2018."
Spain,88.0,45.0,Rioja,Palacios Remondo,"Earthy, dried-fruit aromas are dessicated, while oaky scents of vanilla and licorice offer complexity. This Garnacha-led blend feels jammy in structure; flavors of plum and raspberry come with herbal notes, while the finish is tangy due to pointed acidity, with strawberry flavors in support."
US,88.0,12.0,California,Leese-Fitch,"Richly oaked, this full-bodied wine wraps sweet baking-spice flavors around mouthfilling ripe, plump fruit. It has a smooth texture and persistent fruit and cinnamon flavors that linger on the finish."
US,86.0,25.0,Virginia,Fox Meadow,"Zesty lemon accents toast and grilled peach aromas, leading to a lithe and zippy, citrus-driven palate. It's a great sipper to accompany barbecued chicken on warm summer nights."
US,88.0,20.0,Lake Michigan Shore,St. Julian,"Candied peach and apricot aromas meld with dusty pollen and saffron on the nose. Showing a bit more ripeness on the palate, pineapple and mango tones appear, with wildflower honey and ginger spice offering nuance. Vibrant acidity drives the palate and follows through to a lingering floral finish."
US,92.0,90.0,Napa Valley,Viader,"It is entirely conceivable that this blend of the two Cabernets could improve dramatically with time in the bottle. Currently, it's a very dry, firmly tannic wine, with black currant, mocha, cherry and new oak flavors that have a distinctive edge of sweet herbs, figs and tobacco. Improves considerably with airing in the glass, so decant if you drink it anytime soon."
US,91.0,31.0,Mendocino Ridge,Edmeades,"Concentrated, bright and focused fruit flavors feel shaped by a moderate oak influence in this full-bodied and nicely structured wine. A good amount of tannin wraps the raspberry and blackberry flavors in a firm texture."
Argentina,92.0,110.0,Uco Valley,Bodega Catena Zapata,"A studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak. Much of this wine is fermented in plastic bins (not tanks), and the affiliated intensity grabs your attention. The blackberry flavors are potent and backed by heavy chocolate and toast. Lots of mouthfeel and power, with tannic grab. This wine can age several more years."
France,94.0,115.0,Beaune,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"The Vigne de l'Enfant JÃ©sus is a 10-acre parcel in the heart of the GrÃ¨ves vineyard that once belonged to Carmelite nuns. This vintage, while marked by acidity and soft fruit, does have a firm edge of dark tannins, filled out with plum and red cherry flavors."
France,89.0,20.0,Alsace,Wolfberger,"Although the nose of this wine is subdued, it sends out appealing hints of red apple and yellow pear. The palate is fresh and has real mouthfeel. This is appetizing and full of defined apple and pear notes. The lip-smacking finish makes you long for more."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Barbera d'Alba,Marcarini,"Underbrush, dark berry and tilled soil aromas come together along with a whiff of iris. On the brisk palate, dried sage, anise and orange peel accent the tart cherry core. Bracing acidity provides the backbone."
US,88.0,19.0,Dry Creek Valley,Folie Ã  Deux,"Fruity and dense in brambly blackberry, with a waft of smoky oak, this wine offers a lean, balanced entry before taking on complexity and concentration on the finish, softly layered as it goes."
France,93.0,85.0,Volnay,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"The richness of the fruit from Caillerets is so evident in this scrumptious wine. With its big, bold black fruits, it has sweetness, a soft, generous texture and evocative perfumes. It is so delicious and ready to drink now, that even the acidity that shows through has a hard time reminding us that this wine should age as well."
US,87.0,39.0,Russian River Valley,Zepaltas,"Sharp and candied, with Lifesaver sweet-and-sour cherries and cola softened with smoky wood notes. The tannins are sandpapery and firm. Drink now with rich beef and lamb."
US,84.0,35.0,El Dorado,Perry Creek,"Hot and chocolaty, with briary flavors of blackberry jam, plum currants, mocha and pepper. Turns Porty and raisiny on the finish. The alcohol is 16.5%."
France,87.0,25.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Clerget,"A bit anonymous, but for a big-production nÃ©goce blend from a difficult vintage, you could do a lot worse. Plums and black cherries predominate, but tinges of cinnamon and earth peek through. Tannins are soft; drink now."
US,85.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Grgich Hills,"Scented with green gooseberry aromas, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't for everyone. It's enriched by citrus and peach fruit, and by creamy lees and a touch of oak."
US,90.0,26.0,Columbia Gorge (OR),Phelps Creek,"For those who like a tangy lip-smacking style of Sauvignon Blanc, this is spot-on. Green melon, lemon, lime, grapefruit and green apple are all in play. It dances close to sourness, yet remains lively and refreshing, with terrific persistence. It's a classic palate-cleansing food wine."
Spain,83.0,13.0,Cava,Mas Fi,"This brut nature is citric and bubbly on the palate after opening with aromas of weeds and spring onion. Flavors of lemon, herbs, onion and mustard coalesce in front of a bitter finish."
US,85.0,15.0,North Coast,Tie-Dye,Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.
US,87.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Castoro Cellars,"This wine kicks off with awesome aromatics of jasmine flowers, white beach, green tea and Rainier cherry. The palate is clean and crisp with ripe honeydew melon, Gala apple and Anjou pear flavors that are pleasant but simple."
US,85.0,22.0,Texas High Plains,Becker,"Mild tones of pollen, lemon, vanilla cream and sawdust carry the aromas and flavors. The palate is round and juicy, with appropriate balance of weight and acidity, yet the finish comes short. Perfectly enjoyable as an apÃ©ritif."
France,89.0,39.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Vincent,"This delicious, ripe and juicy wine is full of rich yellow fruits and refreshing balancing acidity. It has a crisp, mineral side to it, with a tangy lemon zest flavor. It's an attractive wine that's just ready to drink now."
US,90.0,45.0,Dry Creek Valley,Merriam,"This is nice and soft, with ripe red-cherry and spice flavors. There's an herbal, earthy dustiness that's appealing. The fruit has a delicious sweetness that makes it ideal for pairing with charred meats."
US,90.0,47.0,Russian River Valley,V. Sattui,"Reduced and extracted, this old-vine wine is smooth and velvety, powerfully made to reflect rich, ripe red berry and a layering of brown sugar. The finish is lean and reminiscent of black licorice."
US,88.0,35.0,Arroyo Seco,Carmel Road,"The most promising Pinots from this central Monterey County appellation, and this is definitely one of them, continue to show its promise. This is one of the few that goes beyond simple fruit and acidity into complexity. It's not an ager, but the raspberries and cherries, accented with acidity and oak, make it a fine partner now for steak, lamb, tuna or an elaborate mushroom risotto."
US,90.0,81.0,California,Testarossa,"Testarossa's annual best-barrel offering starts with broad aromas of violets, blackberry tea and anise on the edges. It's a lighter Pinot density-wise, very soft and expressive with purple fruits, black olive and a fennel-powered acidify on the finish."
US,90.0,60.0,California,Signorello,"This massively oaky wine smells like an explosion in a spice factory, with ginger, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aromas, accented by vanilla, brown sugar, butterscotch and honey. Somewhere in there is some ripe tropical fruit. Enormous and full-bodied, it's a dense, unctuous wine."
Argentina,90.0,22.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Mendel,"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well."
France,86.0,10.0,Vin de France,Gabriel Meffre,"This ripe, generous wine made from 70% Viognier is full of apricot and apple flavors. Its bright acidity and touch of spice make it refreshing and ready to drink."
Italy,88.0,104.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,"Oak, espresso and toast aromas jump out of the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers plum cake, roasted coffee bean, oak extract, licorice, a confectionary note and licorice but not much fruit richness. Raspy wood tannins provide the framework."
US,94.0,50.0,Green Valley,De Loach,"From a hillside spot pummeled by coastal influences, this lovely, light wine opens with a confectionary nose of meringue. Lemony acidity provides a lift of bright, focused tension balanced in concentrated stone fruit and spice with a strong oak backbone."
US,87.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"This is very appealing when first popped, with plenty of forward  butter and caramel scents livening up the fresh fruit. Ready to drink right now, it retains enough acid to stand up to food, though the finish is a little bitter from all the new oak."
France,87.0,22.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine RieflÃ©-Landmann,"Friendly notes of red and yellow apple dominate nose and palate. On the mouth a little bitterness creeps in, but overall the palate remains balanced, clean and fresh."
Argentina,87.0,34.0,Uco Valley,Jed Wines,"Full, meaty berry aromas come with a savory character that suggests herbs, tar and rubber. Foxy, funky and herbal on the palate, then minty and slightly green late, this is a ripped, big, gangly wine made by Australians in Argentina."
France,88.0,10.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Merlet,"Wood aromas and flavors are happily balanced by the ripe berry fruits. So the firm structure is lifted by juicy acidity and fruit to give a wine that will be spicy, fruity and succulent. Drink from 2018."
France,91.0,65.0,Champagne,Jean-NoÃ«l Haton,"A pure, clean mineral-driven Champagne. It's very crisp, with a chalky texture, flavors of green apples and tight acidity. It's one of those Champagnes that needs time in the glass, because as it opens the flavors become more complex, bringing out yellow fruits as well as the underlying citrus."
Italy,89.0,55.0,Barbaresco,Demarie,"Aromas of dried rose, menthol, espresso and mature berry lift out of the glass. The linear, tightly wound palate offers dried red cherry, cranberry and star anise alongside firm fine-grained tannins."
Italy,91.0,94.0,Taurasi,Salvatore Molettieri,"Here's a modern and beautiful wine with warming tones of vanilla, spice, chocolate and blackberry. The wine is thick and dense with dark extraction and very solid tannins. Drink after 2010. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
US,95.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,McCrea,"Among McCrea's RhÃ´ne-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone?lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish."
Spain,87.0,13.0,Rioja,RamÃ³n Bilbao,"Earthy plum and stalky berry aromas are bolstered by bold oak aromas. This feels good and healthy, with spicy oaky flavors that are dry lactic and push the wine's fruit to the background. A woody spicy, minty finish ends this. Drink through 2017."
US,93.0,30.0,San Bernabe,Diora,"Winemaker James Ewart's powerful bottling shows blueberry, vanilla, dark spice and scarlet-red roses on the nose, followed by an intriguing complexity on the palate. Flavors of blackberry jam and black pepper run through the sip, as does a touch of roasted beef, framed by bursting acidity."
France,91.0,109.0,Pommard,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard. The red and dark plum-fruit flavors are developing slowly and the wine needs time to balance. Drink from 2019."
France,85.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Briot,"Fresh and floral, this is a soft and ripe wine. With lemon and lime flavors tempered by apricots and pears, it offers a delicious fruit salad of flavors. The aftertaste is rich and juicy."
US,90.0,32.0,Anderson Valley,Brutocao,"Almost like liquid cherry pie?but not sweet?this medium-bodied wine smells like the red fruit and baking spices, and tastes fresh and juicy with both red and sour cherries. It has good heft on the palate due to firm but light tannins and supportive acidity for balance."
France,92.0,30.0,Chablis,Domaine CheneviÃ¨res,"This is one of the coolest premier crus, meaning that the wine can often age well. In the warm 2015 vintage, the wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2018."
US,90.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Off-dry, with 24 g/L residual sugar, this fragrant and refreshing wine blends in small amounts of Muscat and GewÃ¼rztraminer. Tangerine and peach flavors are concentrated in the core, while the finish brings in lovely flavors of English breakfast tea."
US,92.0,40.0,Santa Barbara County,Margerum,"Exotic scents and flavors highlight this bottling by Doug Margerum that packs crushed kola nut, red roses, cinnamon stick, vanilla and a dewy lavender into the nose. The palate bursts with cologne-like qualities, combining raspberry, mulberry, pomegranate and heirloom plums with violets, lilacs and more purple and dark-red flowers."
US,84.0,20.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Luli,"A heavy, soft wine that tastes somewhat like a candy bar, with raspberry, caramel, brown sugar and roasted almond flavors. From the Pisoni family."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Jumilla,Bodegas Silvano Garcia,"A blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah that's ripe and raisiny but still fresh enough to earn its stripes. The nose is powerful and intense, with a sweet, baked character, while the palate tastes naturally rich but restrained, with blackberry and jammy finishing notes."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,Quercia al Poggio,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this offers scorched earth, chopped herb and black-skinned fruit aromas. The dense palate delivers ripe black plum, mocha and a hint of clove, with firm but rather evolved tannins. Drink 2019."
US,84.0,26.0,Carmel Valley,Joullian,"Nicely dry, clean and crisp, with zesty acidity framing lemon, lime and peach flavors. Could be a bit more concentrated, but it's a friendly, versatile white wine."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Navarra,PrÃ­ncipe de Viana,"Narrow aromas of red currant, raspberry and red plum carry a minty green accent. In the mouth, this blend of Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is tight, with scratchy tannins and no shortage of acidity. Flavors of red berry and plum offer dry spice and herbal shadings."
US,87.0,60.0,Sonoma Coast,Hirsch,"This is a very good, reserved and light-bodied wine with mostly tangy citrus and a bit of riper apple flavor, but it's not at all oaky. It will make an excellent wine before or during a meal, and should be versatile in pairings."
US,82.0,14.0,Paso Robles,Ancient Peaks,"This wine seems unripe, and while it's nicely dry and crisp, it has an aggressive aroma and flavor of tart lime."
US,87.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Erath,"Light and clean, this is a gentle take on Pinot Noir, comparable to a modest Bourgogne from a big shipper such as Bouchard. The alcohol rests comfortably at 13.5%, and the wine is done in a fruit-forward, drink-now style that fits the price point."
US,84.0,25.0,North Coast,The Winery SF,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay smells sweet like marshmallows but tastes dry. It shows mild peach and lean apple flavors, a slight earthy touch and crisp-enough balance."
Italy,86.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,I Sodi,"Burned tire rubber, oak, espresso and roasted coffee bean lead the nose on this extracted wine. The dense, monolithic palate offers sweet vanilla, toasted oak, chocolate, stewed prunes marinated in spirits, and overripe, sugary plum. It's already evolved and lacks energy."
Spain,89.0,15.0,Cava,Loxarel,"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast. It perks up on the finish, with dryness, zest and complexity. Very nice for $15."
US,82.0,15.0,Lodi,Christine Andrew,"Simple and dull, with soft flavors of Lifesaver candy raspberries and vanilla."
US,92.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Okapi,"Big, rich and rewarding, this wine opens with a bouquet of honeysuckle and apple blossom. It offers high acidity and robust oak in equal, complementary measure, as melon, apple and caramel flavors weigh in the smoothly textured palate."
US,92.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sightglass,"Aromas of dried herb, dark plum coffee and barrel spice lead to exquisitely balanced dark-cherry flavors. Velvety tannins provide the frame."
US,86.0,18.0,Umpqua Valley,Abacela,"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron/earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle."
US,94.0,95.0,Howell Mountain,Mirror,"Dense, intense, concentrated and young, this wine is one for the cellar. It has tight aromas of cranberry, dried cherry and cardamom, while flavors offer ripe fruit character and a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It should gain more complexity and smoothness after 2022."
US,93.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Limerick Lane,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine."
Italy,90.0,24.0,Trento,Cembra,"This lovely sparkling wine from northern Italy opens with a refined perlage of small, persistent bubbles. The fragrance offers hints of yellow apples and a whiff of bread crust. There is nice length and it finishes on an almond note."
US,91.0,70.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Leonetti Cellar,"The aromas of earth, herb, cranberry, cherry and barrel tones are light and subdued. The flavors are tart and brambly, with the tannins needing some time to stretch their legs."
Australia,92.0,28.0,McLaren Vale,Alpha Crucis,"While the trend among many Australian Cabernets is towards moderate, silky tannin structures, this austere, firm wine embraces its dry, dusty nature. Cedar and toast frame big cassis fruit, ending with chewy tannins. Drink 2018??028."
Italy,87.0,27.0,Toscana,Podere San Cristoforo,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this hearty red opens with aromas of ripe berry and toasted oak. The dense solid palate delivers black cherry, French oak and white pepper alongside chewy tannins but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish."
US,94.0,145.0,Napa Valley,Signorello,"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul."
US,87.0,50.0,Lake Michigan Shore,Mackinaw Trail,"Using shriveled, dried Cabernet Franc grapes, this appassimento-style wine is a new endeavor in the Michigan wine scene, yet it might merit further experimentation for such a cool climate growing region. Initial notes of balsamic blow off to reveal notes of brandied cherries and dried hay. Medium in weight, with fine, sandy tannins, the palate is condensed and ripe in fresh cherry tones that linger on the finish. As a result of the drying process, the alcohol hits over 15%, yet beyond the roundness on the palate, it's quite imperceptible."
US,87.0,13.0,Paso Robles,Francis Berwyn,"Here's a good, gutsy Cab that won't push Napa out of the spotlight, but offers sound drinking at a fair price. Dry and ready to drink now, it has the classic varietal flavors of black currants, black cherries and cedar."
US,88.0,40.0,Rockpile,Carol Shelton,"The Rockpile appellation's extreme growing conditions make this wine hugely concentrated and powerfully rich. Offers explosive blackberry jam, currant and dark chocolate flavors, wrapped into big tannins. High alcohol gives it a warm mouthfeel."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Buried Cane,"Syrah (37%), Grenache (24%) and MourvÃ¨dre (19%) take the lead on this blend, with the balance Cinsault, Counoise, Cabernet and Viognier. Perfumed aromas of flowers, blue fruit and herbs lead to sweet, plentiful blue and black-fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish lingers."
US,84.0,16.0,Applegate Valley,Wooldridge Creek,"Hints of spicy cranberry and white pepper suggest Syrah, but lack all of the grape's power. There is a fair amount of unripe leafiness as well."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Chianti Classico,Melini,"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this starts with aromas of underbrush, iris, red berries, mint and toasted notes. The wine then discloses a core of black cherry accented with menthol, white pepper, cinnamon-spice and hints of espresso. This is already approachable so enjoy soon."
France,89.0,22.0,Saint-Amour,Henry Fessy,"This is a fruity wine, full of black cherries and plums. From the most northerly of the Beaujolais crus, it has style as well as weight and structure, although the fruitiness that dominates. It is ready to drink now."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau la France,"This is a finely structured wine with the right amount of fruit. With black-currant flavors and plenty of the acidity that is typical of the year, the wine is perfumed, refreshing and likely to develop quickly. Drink starting from 2017."
US,92.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Melville,"There's a very candied red-cherry quality to the nose of this wine from a vineyard that the winery will cease using with this vintage, along with sexy aromas of violet, lilac, clove, cola, peppercorn and rose. A sage-driven character emerges once sipped, giving spice to bright red, slightly sour cranberry fruit."
US,92.0,39.0,Russian River Valley,Fog Crest,"Dark golden-yellow, this opens with inviting notes of toasted caramel. It remains bright in citrus on the palate, getting riper and steamier as it goes, developing deeper, richer flavors of preserved lemon and baked pear. From the winery's estate, this is a small-production wine well worth seeking."
US,83.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Pedroncelli,"There's a lifeless, generic quality to this wine that steals the variety's more common sense of joy and earthy red fruit, but it suffices as general red wine."
France,91.0,50.0,Cornas,Cave de Tain,"As in many 2009s from the Northern RhÃ´ne, the Syrah fruit is superripe. Add in aging in 100% new oak barrels and the result is a big, richly tannic wine redolent of vanilla, cedar and blackberries. Drink now??025."
Italy,89.0,35.0,Chianti Classico,Castellare di Castellina,"Il Poggiale Riserva opens with bold tones of blackberry pie, plum, currant, leather, rum cake and dried rosemary. There's a ripe, almost jammy, quality to the fruit, and the palate feels dense and richly textured."
US,88.0,12.0,California,Mirassou,"This is a great find in this category. Gentle, floral notes of honey and apple mark nose and palate. The light body gives a charming, almost delicate character to this well-balanced and refreshing sweet wine."
France,88.0,20.0,Beaujolais Blanc,Domaine des Terres DorÃ©es,"Smooth, creamy and round, this offers mango, peach and fresher grapefruit flavors, well integrated into its full-bodied texture. With its delicious rich feel, it has weight as well as final acidity."
Italy,87.0,27.0,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,Domenico Fraccaroli,"A great red meat wine because of its distinctive density, extraction and power, this is redolent of red fruit, prune and plum. It finishes with an array of zesty spice nuances that range from ginger to crushed clove."
US,93.0,39.0,Sonoma Valley,Doren,"A tiny-production, 100% varietal wine from a tiny Â½-acre site in heart of Kenwood, next to Chateau St. Jean, this is a wow wine, melding flavors of baked plum, moist earth, mocha and blackberry. It has a lively richness that's both lush and expansive, with a soft, firm tannin structure and lengthy finish."
US,88.0,35.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),J & J,"This 100% varietal wine offers notes of coffee, vanilla and plum. It's medium bodied with espresso flavors and firm, slightly gritty tannins."
Italy,85.0,10.0,Soave,Cantina di Soave,"Simple but well made, it discloses pretty aromas of yellow flowers. The bright palate delivers zesty citrus, pear and melon alongside crisp acidity. Pair with seafood salad or sip as an apÃ©ritif."
US,84.0,15.0,California,Murphy-Goode,"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish."
Italy,90.0,36.0,Sicilia,Benanti,"Released many years after the harvest, this slowly aged expression of Nerello Cappuccio demonstrates balance and character, with pure, delicate notes of cassis, dried berry, sage and rosemary. It finishes with dusty, polished tannins."
Argentina,92.0,120.0,Uco Valley,Salentein,"Stout aromas of ripe blackberry and cassis come with mocha and dry spice notes on the nose of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A firm mouthfeel with grinding tannins is a good set up to oaky, ripe berry flavors accented by wood grain, cocoa and cinnamon notes. Plenty of oak graces a long, ripe, solid finish. Drink through 2018."
US,90.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Clos du Val,"Winemaker Kristy Melton continues to show a sense of restraint in her wines. This Merlot provides a classic example, concentrated in dusty red fruit and smooth, supple tannins, a sideways glance of cinnamon and clove flirting thoughout. Structure and elegance reign here over power and oak."
Argentina,87.0,20.0,Agrelo,Finca Decero,"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008."
France,90.0,20.0,Fronton,ChÃ¢teau Coutinel,"This is a young, firmly tannic wine with its solid, dry structure still dominating the ripe fruit. It's concentrated and dense with a dusty texture giving both weight and the ability to age. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a wine that will go several years."
US,91.0,30.0,Dry Creek Valley,Wine Guerrilla,"This seriously good Zin shows off its ancient vineyard's terroir as well as Dry Creek's amenability for Zinfandel. Rich and complex, the wine is very spicy, flooding the mouth with creamy flavors of grilled red cherries, red currants, Fig Newton cookies, mocha and even a hint of sweet, char-broiled beefsteak. Now through 2012."
US,88.0,65.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Tantara,"Pomegranate, sour cherry, cranberry and slight anise emerge with patience on the shy nose. The flavors are also light, with cranberry sauce, brown spices, a touch of pepper and an herbal finish."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Vermentino di Sardegna,Tenute Soletta,"Fresh and clean, this Vermentino offers ripe aromas of apricot and peach, with background tones of citrus and pear. It's extra smooth and silky on the close."
France,88.0,22.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Domaine de Magalanne,"Magalanne's top wine is a wood-matured blend of 40% Syrah, 30% MourvÃ¨dre and 30% Carignan. It's nicely balanced and spry on the palate, easily moving from raspberry, cherry and citrus to leather, spice and herb before ending on some stony, dusty notes. Drink it over the next year or two."
Spain,86.0,21.0,Ribera del Duero,Emina,"Ripe berry aromas approach raisiny, but settle on jammy plum and leather. This is tannic and wide, with ruggedness to the mouthfeel. Flavors of earthy berry, baked fruits and cocoa end with grab, heat and burn. This is good but rough, like a gravel road."
US,86.0,28.0,Paso Robles,D'Anbino,"Blended from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, this wine is soft and fruity. With ripe blackberry and cherry pie, mocha and licorice flavors, it's easy to drink now."
France,87.0,18.0,Fronton,ChÃ¢teau Flotis,"The wild perfumes of the NÃ©grette dominate this wine. Giving aromas of roses and beetroot and black fruit flavors, it is firm with young tannins. The wine is still developing and should age at least until 2018."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Ribera del Duero,Milcampos,"Warmth and mocha greet you, but dig as you might it's hard to settle on any particular fruit aromas or flavors. There is, however, plenty of cola, rooty flavors and baked characteristics. Finishes almost hot, with sticky tannins and a sprig of green. Drink now through 2009."
US,94.0,100.0,Mount Veeder,Communication Block,"Serious cellar Cabernet here. It's eruptive with jammy, blackberries, cherries and black currants, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. The new oak adds spicy, pungent notes of buttered toast and caramel. Yet it's also very tannic. So balanced and finessed, this Cab should have no trouble negotiating the next 10-plus years. Maybe longer. Much longer."
France,87.0,28.0,Petit Chablis,Domaine Vincent Dauvissat,"For a Petit Chablis, this is serious and complex, with delicious ripe green and yellow fruits; there is a touch of caramel with toast just at the edge."
US,92.0,68.0,Sonoma Coast,Red Car,"From a tiny, organically farmed vineyard outside of Occidental, this wine is dense in earth, with a brambly nose of wild cherry and cranberry. Salty and herbal, it retains plenty of acidity on the light-bodied palate, offering a mix of cinnamon and tangerine on the finish."
Spain,83.0,28.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Altos de Torona,"Waxy, oxidized aromas suggest Sherry and late-harvest wines. A peachy, fully mature palate offers apricot and papaya flavors in front of a salty, dry finish with fino Sherry notes."
Italy,85.0,45.0,Montello e Colli Asolani,Case Paolin,"This blend from northern Italy opens with aromas of currants, black berries and bell pepper. It offers restrained black fruit flavors layered with oak and espresso sensations. But overall, it is rather flat with an abrupt, astringent finish."
US,88.0,21.0,Santa Barbara County,Margerum,"Very light and slightly sweet in style, this low-alcohol bottling offers stone fruit, lemon juice and peels, and the slightest hint of petrol on the honeyed nose. Exceedingly bright and crisp on the palate, the peachy sweetness is cut by a nearly bubbly acidity. It would be great for pool parties."
Spain,92.0,30.0,Bierzo,Peique,"This is intense in both color and aromatics. Potent scents of black fruit, animal hide, graphite and bold oak are at the fore. It feels pure, lush and well built, with dark flavors of blackberry, chocolate, toast and spice. Coffee and pepper are the prime finishing flavors; drink now through 2015."
US,91.0,35.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Saviah,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (56%), Merlot (33%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of milk chocolate, cherry, herb and moist earth give way to soft supple palate-coating fruit and barrel flavors. It shows a lot of elegance and refinement."
US,93.0,26.0,El Dorado,Skinner,"This extremely flavorful wine smells like fig, almond and custard, and tastes like butterscotch, lemon meringue and toasted almond. It is quite full bodied, almost thick in texture and about to burst at the seams with richness."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Toscana,Mocali,"Here's a delicate white that offers aromas of acacia flower, white peach and citrus zest that carry over to the palate. Moderate acidity brightens the juicy fruit flavors."
Spain,84.0,11.0,Rioja,Bodegas TobÃ­a,"Sweaty and pickled at first, although airing reveals some hidden dark fruit aromas. The palate is grapy and accented by black plum, yet it finishes salty and cheeky, with grabby tannins. Has it good points but lacks direction and elegance."
US,88.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"This bold, full-bodied white is a nifty showcase of Pinot Gris's unique duality. On the nose, it seems quite spry and cutting, wafting of crushed minerals, crisp green-apple skins and blossoms. The palate, however, is weighty and mouth filling, a testament to 30 days of maturation on its lees. It maintains its fresh, fruity flair and pleasantly sunny citrus acidity."
US,84.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Calcareous,"Ridiculously high in alcohol, clocking in at nearly 16%, and it shows in a porty taste that frames the blackberry jam and chocolate flavors. Drink now."
US,92.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Market Vineyards,"This Bordeaux-style blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and one fifth each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Winemaker Charlie Hoppes goes for a big-boned, oaky, deeply fruited style. The structure (tannins, acids, barrel flavors) is in place to support the dark, cassis fruit flavors. Highlights of violets, licorice and clean earth add welcome details."
Italy,87.0,26.0,Sicilia,Baglio di Pianetto,"Ramione is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Nero d'Avola that delivers a unique and very attractive mineral quality. Under that drying layer of white stone and talc powder, you'll find bursting red cherry and rich blueberry. The various elements of this velvety wine work very well together."
US,89.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"A very well-made Merlot, with sweet fruit and attractive scents of vanilla and cracker. Though still showing a lot of youthful acidity, it wraps the fruit in a big blast of new oak and finishes with a hint of heat."
France,90.0,24.0,Brouilly,ChÃ¢teau de la TerriÃ¨re,"Bottled unfiltered, this is a richly ripe wine, layered with a more smoky, even mineral, texture from the volcanic soil of the vineyard. It is dense, the tannins giving hints of wood as well as a black plum skin character."
US,92.0,20.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"The grape's stereotypical green nose gets a whole new interpretation, with aromas of sunburned hay, bags of desiccated grass and wild oregano. The herbaceous characters carry the palate, but it's smooth with thyme and chile verde flavors, and a lingering bit of citrus tartness and tannic grip."
France,86.0,12.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine du Rey,"Ripe and rounded, this is a smooth wine given richness from the Gros Manseng in the blend. Citrus vies with pear and apricot, cut with intense acidity. It is fresh and textured with a steely character at the end. Wait to drink until the end of 2015."
US,93.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Rasa,"Sourced from the Seven Hills vineyard, this deep and dark Syrah offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors. The palate is dense and complex, with beautifully integrated charcoal, gravel, earth and espresso components."
US,89.0,19.0,Lake County,Shannon Ridge,"Fresh and crisp, this light-bodied wine has fragrant pine, floral and citrus aromas, vivid lemon-lime flavors and a nice, tight balance that wakes up the taste buds."
US,87.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Heron Hill,"Curious tones of red berry and grapefruit mark this intensely fruit-forward, semi-sweet Riesling. It's concentrated on the palate, but balanced with hints of smoky minerality and delicate dried herb notes."
US,87.0,24.0,Clarksburg,Urban Legend,"There are said to be fewer than 100 acres of Teroldego in California, so this one is worth trying. Midweight and fruity, it has lavender, anise and leather lightly folded into the mix. A good wine to start the evening and enjoy by the glass."
US,93.0,75.0,Carneros,Schramsberg,"This sparkler was made from a majority of Chardonnay with a seasoning of Pinot Noir, the grapes grown at Hyde Vineyard, among other sites within the appellation. A doughy, tart wine, it brightly expresses green apple, orange, grapefruit and a more developed creaminess of biscotti, delighting in a persistence of lemon zest."
US,87.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,"A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is indeed a sturdy red table wine. The tannins are dense and chewy, the fruit submerged beneath barrel flavors of toast, caramel and nougat. It spent 20 months in 50% new French oak."
France,90.0,18.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Tour Saint-Vincent,"A rich and smooth wine, this is packed with black fruits that are touched with smoky tannins from the wood aging. It's full, fruity and structured on the palate. It will age over at least 5?? years, but, with its rich texture, it will be drinkable soon."
US,87.0,15.0,Oregon,Acrobat,"This wine bursts with the scents and flavors of fresh strawberries. It's soft and fruity but finishes dry, with flavors gently turning from berry to cherry candy."
US,85.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Ancient Peaks,"A soft, gentle Zinfandel, a little sweet, like a raspberry and cherry mocha drink sprinkled with cocoa and cinnamon. Easy to drink with spicy meats, soft cheeses, everyday fare."
US,86.0,23.0,Rogue Valley,J. Scott Cellars,"This is a well-balanced Petite Sirah, with chewy but proportionate tannins, a broadly fruity, black cherry core and nuanced highlights of apricot. The finish does a quick fade."
US,86.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,"This Proprietor's Reserve Grenache is one of a handful of Maryhill's 2010 reds that improves upon the previous vintage. Sappy and relatively substantial, this has a core of Bing cherry, along with chewy tannins and an earthy finish."
US,87.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Inspire Moore,"This has concentrated apple, mango and lime skin notes that are shaded with tones of smoke, crushed chalk and white pepper. Round and rich on the palate, with a mouthfilling viscosity, it's balanced with a flash of lemony acidity and a tingling tea-leaf astringency."
France,86.0,22.0,CÃ´te Chalonnaise,Domaine Michel Goubard,"This bright, lemony wine is lightly mineral as well as fruity. A crisp apple character gains even more tightness from a shot of lime juice. The wine is ready to drink, light and refreshing with a buttery aftertaste."
US,86.0,46.0,Edna Valley,Tolosa,"A solid Syrah, dry and full-bodied, but not quite up to the last three vintages. Although there are savory blackberry and currant flavors, there's also a tough mintiness, and the mouthfeel is a bit scoury. Drink soon."
France,93.0,70.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Brown,"This sophisticated wood-aged wine comes from a fine year for whites in Pessac-LÃ©ognan. Subtle wood supports the rich tropical and yellow fruits as well as the crisper acidity. The texture, with its minerality, is still developing, with good potential. Drink from 2017."
US,88.0,55.0,Virginia,Barboursville Vineyards,"Savory mint, prune and soy sauce blend nicely with notes of violet and rose. More fruit comes through on the palate, showing a bright cranberry note that livens everything up."
France,91.0,57.0,Cornas,Maison Nicolas Perrin,"The 2011s from Cornas show high levels of ripeness, and this nÃ©gociant wine is no exception. It's almost pruny, with other notes of meat, clove and cinnamon, yet remains crisp and firm, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish. Drink now??025."
US,90.0,80.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"A splash of Malbec is included in this otherwise varietal wine, a grippy, structured and full-bodied mountain expression of big tannins and potent black fruit. Leather and tobacco make their way into the experience, finishing soft and on the way to being resolved."
US,89.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ryan Patrick,"This coral-pink-colored wine brings light aromas of cherry and spice. It drinks a hair off dry, with a rounded, fleshy feel and a mouthwatering finish."
US,92.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Boundary Breaks,"Boundary Breaks has proven to be the break-out producer of the Finger Lakes this year with an excellent line up of wines, and this off-dry wine is amongst its best. Elegantly perfumed with notes of fresh green florals and herbs, it builds in power and expression on the palate with pristine white peach flavors pierced with lime acidity and a reverberating mineral finish."
Italy,92.0,65.0,Barolo,Sordo,"This opens with aromas of pressed rose petal, underbrush, truffle, white pepper and leather. The already approachable palate delivers juicy black cherry, cooking spice and licorice. Drink through 2022."
US,81.0,22.0,Napa Valley,Trinitas,"Tastes tired and flabby, with sweet oak and alcohol flavors and not much else going on."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bonnet,"Always a great value, this warm and fruity wine is immediately accessible and drinkable. It has fine red berry fruits, a good core of tannins and just the right fruit acidity. Drink now."
US,88.0,10.0,Finger Lakes,Fulkerson,"This delicately spritzy bottling of Diamond, a Concord grape hybrid, offers all the juicy, grapy deliciousness of Concord with twists of tropical and citrus fruit flavors. Moderately sweet and light in alcohol, it's straightforward, fun and guzzle worthy."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Roero,Deltetto,"Aromas of white spring flower, exotic fruit and an herbal note waft out of the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers white peach, pear, vanilla and toasted oak alongside modest acidity. A citrusy note closes the finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),North by Northwest,"Aromas of dried herbs, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and cherry are varietal and lead to abundant woodspice accents. The palate offers lively acidity that frames the lithe yet sweet fruit flavors."
US,92.0,39.0,Monterey,Stephen & Walker,"There's a depth of Burgundian flavor, a forest floor and mulch note in this rich, earthy Pinot Noir. It explodes with red and black cherry, licorice, tangerine zest and cola flavors, with a superb tannin structure. Beautiful now, and should develop for up to eight years."
US,86.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Carlton Cellars,"A mix of blueberry, blackberry and cherry fruit can't completely mask the earthy, stemmy streak that runs through this wine. Reductive and tight, it will require substantial airing to open up."
US,88.0,23.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"Perfumed, floral and intriguing, this is still tight with mountain tannins. In a few years, its thick black-cherry and pepper tones will emerge, becoming rounded out with notes of violet and oaky leather."
US,90.0,35.0,Calistoga,August Briggs,"Faint aromatics hide an effusiveness on the palate of thick, dense blackberry jam and brown sugar, the ripe power of the wine kept in check by a balance of acidity. Fuller bodied in style, it remains dry and vibrant on the finish."
US,90.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mercer,"Aromas of melon and pear run into a smooth, full-bodied core of lovely fruit that's highlighted with a hint of fresh cream. Broad and mouthfilling, with excellent concentration, this is a fine example of Washington State Pinot Gris."
US,85.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Cerro Prieto,"High alcohol gives the wine heat, especially in the finish. It's also overripe, with the blackberries veering into port-like raisins and prunes. But it is thoroughly dry, with good acidity and tannins. Tasted twice, with consistent results."
US,83.0,40.0,Rogue Valley,Deer Creek,A dilute wine with a touch of pale cherry fruit. It turns woody on the finish.
Australia,89.0,19.0,Western Australia,West Cape Howe,"Surprisingly firmly built, with crisp acids and firm tannins framing plummy, blackberry fruit and vanilla, cinnamon and clove notes. Good now with rare meats, or cellar through 2010 to round off today's rough edges."
US,88.0,28.0,California,Lorenzi Estate,"From this Temecula producer, a barrel selection of plum and black cherry Zinfandel with good depth and structure that's still got some tannins to work out but is ready to drink now."
US,88.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Bellwether,"A shock of sour cherry and pink grapefruit flavors penetrates through this revitalizing dry rosÃ©. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Gamay and Pinot Noir, it carries out a fine balancing act between fruit forwardness and elegance."
Australia,86.0,10.0,Victoria,Frisk,"This is truly prickly, with a slight spritz of CO2 acting to perk up the lime, green apple and pineapple aromas and flavors. It's at the same time plump and off dry, deftly balancing sweetness and zest. Drink now. Old Bridge Cellars."
US,93.0,40.0,Wahluke Slope,Fielding Hills,"The Fielding Hills Syrah remains one of my favorites in a state loaded with great Syrahs, fruit-powered with spicy purple fruits, annotated with scents of game, anise, smoke and moist earth. The black and purple fruits dominate, as expressive and ripe as any Syrah in the state. It's still young, a bit oaky, and relatively high in alcohol. Give it some bottle age and all the complexity will come into focus."
US,90.0,52.0,Livermore Valley,Nottingham Cellars,"Young winemaker Collin Cranor's best Cabernet to date, intense and rounded by savory black cherry, still wound tight but already showing off its oak, sage and tobacco goodness. The wine is well-structured and rich in vanilla and blackberry, a testament to the winemaker's close workings with grower Julio Covarrubias."
US,93.0,66.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling has a nose that suggests boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. The dense aromas are livened up by iron, black loam, Indian spice and black-tea notes. The same range of dark fruits power the palate, especially black plums, and the rich and tangy flavors are nuanced with black sage, bergamot and eucalyptus notes."
France,91.0,50.0,Chablis,Domaine Vrignaud,"From old vines planted in 1955, this dense, impressive wine offers both perfume apple and pear fruits and a creamy texture. Behind this generous front, the wine is tight, steely and needs to age. Give it until 2018."
US,90.0,50.0,Livermore Valley,Steven Kent,"Voluptuous and inviting, this Malbec has softened tannins amid bright blue and black fruit and wild cinnamon flavors. Structured and concentrated this is a memorable wine that will age another 5??0 years and go deliciously with a range of foods."
France,85.0,15.0,Alsace,Robert Klingenfus,"Bitter cherry flavors mark a wine that is light in texture, with attractive acidity and a soft, fruity red berry finish. Not for aging."
Italy,94.0,145.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Pian delle Vigne,"Plum cake, underbrush, dark berry, menthol and a touch of mocha unfold in the glass. The taut, full-bodied palate offers chewy black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and sage framed in youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins. A tobacco note closes the finish. Drink 2022??032."
US,93.0,30.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Au Bon Climat,"Shows very bright acidity and a firm minerality, which gives it a tangy, mouthwatering vitality. Rich, too, in lemondrop candy, pineapple jam and spice flavors. The oak has been tastefully applied, with just- right notes of buttered toast. A flattering, balanced, elegant Chardonnay for drinking soon."
US,90.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Via Giusti,"This wine takes a light approach to ripeness and oak, letting the freshness of the fruit speak with abandon. Bristling in acidity, it offers a layering of complementary dark cherry, huckleberry, pomegranate and cola, before a thick concentration of power peaks on the finish."
US,84.0,24.0,Bennett Valley,Frostwatch,"Combining 80% SÃ©millon with 20% Sauvignon Blanc, this is an intense, oaky and almost caramelized wine. Off dry, with the producer reporting less than 1% residual sugar, it retains a sweetness of baked melon and peach, finishing ripe and round."
US,91.0,18.0,Mendocino,Claudia Springs,"Wines like this make a strong argument for the future of Pinot Noir grown in this region. The blend includes 10 percent Pinot Meunier, which pumps up the color. It?s a spicy, plummy wonder that?s soft and ready to drink. It tastes of spiced apples and cinnamon, with a hint of violets in the smooth finish."
France,87.0,14.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Louis Jadot,"Ripe wine, pushing its toast, pear and apricot flavors. Smooth, with an English walnut taste, and green herb acidity. Ready to drink now."
US,88.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,Don't come looking for your light and fruity Grenache?the 15.2% alcohol lets you feel the fire pumping through the veins of this deeply ripe and potent wine. In a blind tasting you might easily think it was a Zin rather than a Washington Grenache.
US,90.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),North by Northwest,"Technically proficient and showing a certain amount of style, this is a focused Cabernet with tart, tangy cassis and berry flavors. The barrel regimen adds bits of toast and mocha to the finish."
Australia,84.0,26.0,Yarra Valley,Yering Station,"Entry-level Pinot Noir isn't an easy ask anywhere in the world. This one is marked by chocolate and espresso overtones and features a dark, earthy core that's medium-bodied and appropriately silky in texture."
France,84.0,16.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine les Fouques,"Firmly tannic wine with blackberry fruits and a woody, stalky character. The hard-edged and spicy fruit is on the green side."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Montsant,AcÃºstic,"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body."
Spain,87.0,28.0,Cava,Mestres,"Soft, ripe, earthy aromas of sweet stone fruits and melon turn a bit soapy as this breathes out. Foamy and overactive, this rosÃ© is chunky on the palate, with flavors of nectarine and brown sugar that finish round and easy."
US,89.0,22.0,North Coast,Daniel Cohn,"With aromas like wood smoke, cardamom and black pepper, this is a beefy, spicy wine. It is full bodied, quite oaky in flavor, and almost tastes like pepper steak in liquid form. Ripe and satisfying dark-fruit flavors kick in and linger on the finish."
US,90.0,23.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Novelty Hill,"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish."
US,93.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Hestan,"Firm and bright, this is a full-bodied, generously layered red rich in red currant, tobacco, clove and black pepper. Lengthy and complexly woven, it has a gravelly edge of minerality to its texture and taste."
France,87.0,12.0,Coteaux Varois,Les MaÃ®tres Vignerons de Saint-Louis,"Full-bodied wine, with red fruits, an attractive bite of spice and a background of the crispest acidity. The wine has richness, making it food friendly. Screwcap."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Montecucco,Piandibugnano,"L'Erpico is a dense and meaty expression of Sangiovese from Montecucco (coastal Tuscany) that opens with ripe cherry, blackberry and meaty tones of bacon and moist earth. There's an interesting juxtaposition in the mouth of sweet versus sour fruit flavors."
US,94.0,52.0,Adelaida District,Brecon Estate,"Very cohesive aromas of blueberry and black currant meet with deep violet, lilac and brioche aromas on this bottling of the relatively rare grape from Southwest France. A well-woven tapestry of blueberry mousse, cola spice, root beer, dried ginger and clove dust make for layers and layers of thick and impressive flavor."
France,94.0,110.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Philippe Colin,This opulent wine is full of ripe fruit and has a generous texture. Apricot and pear flavors give richness that is cut by acidity that gives the wine tremendous lift. The toast adds the lightest touch at the end. Drink from 2019.
US,89.0,50.0,Chehalem Mountains,Lachini,"The 2012 vintage brings rich fruit flavors to this estate bottling, with a core of cherries and streaks of kale and espresso. The tannins are ripe and sufficient, though the herbal elements may soften a bit with further bottle age."
US,85.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Topanga,"With 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this wine is muted yet robust, speaking with a loud voice of tannin and power. Simple and soft, it's ready to enjoy now."
US,86.0,65.0,Rutherford,Wm. Harrison,"A 100% varietal wine, this is dusty and dense, concentrated in a pillowy tannin structure that grips the palate with force. Toasted oak plays strongman to quieter aspects of currant and berry."
Italy,92.0,300.0,Barolo,Ceretto,"Aromas of exotic spice, iris, oak, coffee bean and wild berry come together on this structured, glossy red along with a note of grilled herb. The chewy palate boasts raspberry confiture, red cherry, espresso, dark chocolate, orange peel and tobacco while tightly knit, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's youthfully assertive and needs to fully develop. Drink 2020??030."
US,94.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Parallel,"Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, crÃ¨me de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak. It shows the tough, hard tannins you often find in low production mountain Cabernets. Made by the well-known consulting winemaker, Philippe Melka, it has the structure of a wine that needs age. Give it at least eight years, and it could be one that lasts decades."
US,92.0,65.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Testarossa,"Deep black cherry, sarsaparilla and vanilla show on the full and hearty nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard that was planted in the 1970s. It's tightly woven on the palate, with earthy spice and dark red fruits. The acidity holds crisp deep into the finish."
US,92.0,70.0,Russian River Valley,Ram's Gate,"From a steeply sloped site also planted to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this thick, leathery wine shows undeniable power and intensity although it is still tannic and young. Heady bouts of lavender, red cherry and black licorice compete for attention on the palate amid intriguing floral, rose-like aromatics."
Australia,82.0,14.0,South Eastern Australia,Terra Australis,"Chocolate and prune aromas and flavors come across as somewhat generic, then finish on a drying, astringent note."
US,82.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Tedeschi Family,Sweet candied apple overpowers this oddly textured and flavored wine.
US,85.0,25.0,Applegate Valley,Plaisance Ranch,"Merlot needs more concentration than this in order to really shine as a stand-alone varietal wine. This is thin, green, and simply generic. Pomegranate fruit peeks through, quickly overlaid with weedy tannins."
US,88.0,50.0,Sonoma Mountain,Ravenswood,"This Merlot-heavy blend adds an additional 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Malbec to its mix, all from a single vineyard high atop Sonoma Mountain. Dill, cucumber and cranberry combine intriguingly, before a core of juicy acidity adds buoyancy to the mix."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Cortaccia,"This radiant white opens with scents of stone fruit, blackcurrant, crushed herb and cut grass while the vibrant palate doles out honeydew melon, white peach, mineral and a hint of sage. Crisp acidity leaves a clean, tangy finish."
France,92.0,45.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Saint-Maur,"An attractive silver-pink colored wine, this is beautifully ripe and fruity. It has a great balance between acidity and raspberry fruit. There is a herbal edge that gives the wine a fine tangy character. Drink this wine from the end of 2017."
US,90.0,55.0,North Coast,Keating,"Dark colored, fragrant and firm-textured, this Bordeaux-style blend has a lot of substance and will appeal to lovers of full-bodied, tannic wines. The aromas resemble dark cherry, black currant and that tempting cigar box note. It feels full and weighty on the palate and well laced with supportive tannins."
US,95.0,75.0,Howell Mountain,Duckhorn,"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Chianti Superiore,Poggio al Casone,"This is a thin, sharp Chianti Superiore with thorny acidity and zesty aromas of white cherry and cassis. You'll want to match this wine with a creamy food such as risotto with grated Parmigiano cheese."
France,89.0,19.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,Fresh notes of green Conference pear are edged with citrus freshness. The palate shows the same restrained fruit and has a lovely bitter edge that lends texture and shape. Freshness pervades. The finish is just about still dry.
Argentina,88.0,17.0,Mendoza,Don Manuel VillafaÃ±e,"Spicy woody aromas include a note of mushroom. This feels hard and ultratannic, with acidity suggestive of red-wine vinegar. A wiry mix of salt and sour flavors is attached to savory plum fruit, while this pinches down on a drying abrasive finish."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Cava,Mas de Monistrol,"Basic, minerally aromas of apple and pear are good and suggest iodine. The mouthfeel is a bit foamy, but this is also fresh and vital for a 2007 Cava. Crisp flavors of lime, orange and green herbs end similarly, with linear balance."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Valentina Cubi,"Although this aged Amarone offers rich notes of dried prune, spice, resin and leather, you should not wait to drink it. Behind the fruit notes are somewhat tired notes of old spice and dried flowers. It has firm tannins and good length."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Barbaresco,Pasquale Pelissero,"Subdued aromas of red berry, sweet baking spice, rose and a balsamic note lift out of the glass. On the tight, tense palate, bracing tannins frame wild cherry, white pepper, clove, powdered sage and anisette."
Spain,87.0,14.0,Rueda,Viore,"A typical aromatic trio of apple, peach and minerals gives way to a balanced palate. Pithy melon is the key flavor on this ?patio-style??white. Melony flavors carry onto a finish that flattens out fairly quickly."
Argentina,90.0,108.0,RÃ­o Negro Valley,Bodega NoemÃ­a de Patagonia,"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh."
France,92.0,150.0,Champagne,Lanson,"Produced from Grand Cru vineyards on the CÃ´te des Blancs, this wine, now mature, is ripe and rich. While the initial fruit has diminished, it has not forgotten its tight, mineral texture and crisp acidity. The toast flavors, now dominant, are given a final lift by hints of honeyed almonds and steely acidity."
US,91.0,32.0,Edna Valley,Stephen Ross,"Rounded plum and berry aromas grow more complex thanks to hints of sarsparilla bark, rose buds, cinnamon stick and nutmeg on the nose of this cool-climate bottling. The palate is quite peppery, with dried red flowers, red plums, peppercorns, strawberries and a texturally earthy core of fine-grained tannins."
US,91.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Syzygy,"This 100% varietal wine comes from Conner Lee, Sagemoor and Klipsun vineyards. Already six years old, it's near full-bloom with aromas of dates, blackberry pie, dried herbs and spice. The black fruit flavors are full bodied and dense. Drink up."
US,91.0,19.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Beresan,"There should be plenty of buzz about The Buzz. Dense and dark, loaded with black fruits, coffee grounds and ground pepper, this high-alcohol, slightly volatile wine is not unlike some cult wines selling for four times the price."
US,92.0,65.0,Carneros,Donum,"Give this polished young Pinot Noir some time in the cellar to come around. It's a seriously good wine, dry, tannic and medium-bodied, with a dense core of cherry and plum flavors. If you have to drink it before 2015, give it several hours in a decanter."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Sicilia,Morgante,Here's a straightforward and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers delicious blackberry and black cherry flavors that are accented by a hint of Mediterranean herbs. The ripe palate is brightened by just enough fresh acidity.
Italy,93.0,83.0,Colli della Toscana Centrale,Cignale,"Cignale, or wild boar is one of Tuscany's best expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon. A small percentage of   Merlot is added for softness and flavor and the wine oozes darkness, blackberry and exotic spice at its core. Pair it with game meat or spicy pork sausage."
France,88.0,40.0,Lussac Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau des Landes,"From ChÃ¢teau des Landes' old vines, this is a concentrated, solid wine. Dark tannins have dark chocolate and licorice flavors, with a structure that dominates the fruit and needs to soften. New wood aging was perhaps excessive, but give the wine time. Drink from 2017."
France,90.0,51.0,Saint-Ãmilion,Clos Fourtet,"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape."
Spain,90.0,35.0,Valencia,Venta del Puerto,"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs. Drying and tannic on the finish, but balanced. Neither cooked nor overweight. Drink now through 2011."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Roero,Bersano,"Subtle aromas of acacia flower and a whiff of almond lead the way. The round, easygoing palate offers pear, citrus peel and a hint of hazelnut alongside soft acidity."
Australia,88.0,9.0,South Eastern Australia,Stonehaven,"Quite lively and solid, offering loads of black currant and bramble on the nose, and ripe dark fruit with smoky accents on the palate. The mouthfeel is supple, with a nice peppery tang, and it finishes well, with tart berry and licorice notes."
US,88.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Charles & Charles,"Aromas of yellow apple, Bosc pear and melon lead to a textured, flavorful palate and a finish that lingers. It's a spot-on example of the variety and a guaranteed crowd-pleaser."
US,90.0,90.0,Napa Valley,Signorello,"This powerful wine that also holds 5% Cabernet Franc shyly packs a punch. At first it comes off as elegant, soft and highly approachable. Faint notions of blackberry and black cherry are highlighted amidst a concentrated, tannic build."
Italy,86.0,17.0,Sicilia,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello,"Cristo di Campobello's value line, C'D'C', includes this fresh blend of Chardonnay, Grillo, Insolia and Catarratto. This easy-going white offers citrus tones of pink grapefruit and lemon zest backed by dried hay and honey."
US,90.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Va Piano,"Rich, evocative, lush with aromas of earth, coffee, chocolate, mocha?scents that suggest excellent evolution ahead. Right now the fruit is primary, tart, raspberry and cherry, and not yet smoothed into the greater whole. But all the potential and pieces are there."
US,87.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Duck Pond,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together."
US,92.0,24.0,Fair Play,Baiocchi Wines,"This wonderful and youthful wine shows how the RhÃ´ne varieties blend so well. It tastes as if the Grenache gives ripe fruit and the Syrah adds power and tannins. It's a big wine, with ample grippy texture, full body and good potential for aging through at least 2019."
US,90.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Frank Family,"This 100% varietal wine was aged in differing levels of oak, from 33% new French to once and twice-used (also French). It makes for a bold presence of thick soft black plum and licorice complemented by long-lasting texture and a length of leather."
US,92.0,40.0,Sonoma Coast,Bjornstad,"Lots of zesty acidity in this wonderfully complex, exotic Pinot Noir, which comes from the true Sonoma Coast, in the Fort Ross area. It's explosive in wild summer raspberries and cherries, briary nettles, vanilla bean and spices, with a perfect coating of sweetly caramelized oak. Very pure and refined, and best enjoyed young."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Ca' Viola,"A lush fruit nose, with plenty of blackberry jam, woodsmoke and anise. Quite chunky on the palate, but amaiable and easy going, although not a particularly long finish. A pleasant food friendly wine for a weekday night after a hard day at work."
US,87.0,20.0,Hudson River Region,Millbrook,"While earthy on the nose, the palate of this stainless-steel fermented Tocai offers pretty, primary flavors of apricot, tangerine and rose-petal jam. Luscious in body and texture, it's soft in acidity and finishes with a touch of warmth on the finish."
Italy,84.0,60.0,Barolo,Mauro Molino,"This is dominated by oak, toasted coffee beans and a hint of meat juices. The palate is short and finishes on a green note, with bitter wood tannins."
France,90.0,40.0,Givry,Domaines Devillard,"The line of premier cru vineyards runs to the west of the town of Givry, with Servoisine touching the town's last houses. The wine is ripe and juicy, hiding its tannins in the heart of generous rich red fruits. It is likely to be a wine that will develop quickly and should be ready from 2019."
Argentina,83.0,13.0,MaipÃº,Palo Alto,"Earthy and stalky on the nose, this wine struggles to come up with the goods. It's sappy and citric in feel, with burnt, stalky flavors of herbal raspberry. A tart tasting, oaky finish does little to help this along."
France,92.0,34.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"Fermented in oak, this is the second wine from the estate. It has much of the fine concentration, the richness and the dark chocolate and black-fruit flavors of the first wine, just with a softer hue. It is likely to develop relatively quickly and generously. Drink from 2019."
US,89.0,45.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Raptor Ridge,"Tart and tightly wound fruit flavors range from watermelon to strawberry, with a heavy infusion of citrus. It's sharply acidic, with some suggestions of toast from light barrel aging. A streak of cola runs through the finish."
US,84.0,20.0,Virginia,Chateau Morrisette,"This wine has a restrained nose, featuring wooly aromas of leather, wild berry and cherry. The light- to medium-bodied palate has supple, fine-grained tannins, with light flavors of savory spice and grilled herb. A note of macerated strawberry lingers on the finish."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Moscato d'Asti,CÃ  ed Balos,"This is a beautiful Moscato d'Asti with peach mousse, tangerine, white almond, honey, ginger and spring flower. Perfect for nut-based desserts, the sparkler is soft and sweet with a distant touch of tangy spice on the finish."
US,90.0,31.0,Monticello,King Family,"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec is concentrated on the nose, with a mÃ©lange of red and black berries, red plum, fern and sweet-spice-inflected cured meat. The well-integrated palate carries similar characters supported by ample weight, firm tannins and balanced acidity. A black pepper note rings on the finish of this well-balanced, inviting wine."
US,92.0,60.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"Laetitia's La Colline bottling is always a big, vital wine, unusually rich for Pinot Noir but nonetheless compelling. The 2009 vintage has been kind to it, resulting in fantastically concentrated flavors of cherry pie, pomegranate, persimmon, cola and mushroom, liberally enhanced by sweet new oak. It's a potent wine, one that Pinot purists might say is too extracted. But there's no denying its delicious beauty. Drink now??015."
US,86.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Vin du Lac,"The Grisant Pinot Gris is more full and fleshy than the winery's LEHM bottling, but still a bit one dimensional. Pleasant flavors of pear fruit, skin phenolics and light suggestions of cinnamon."
US,86.0,35.0,Sonoma Coast,Flowers,"Dry and weighty at first on the palate, this wine is ultimately tart and tangy, awash in grippy acidity sparked by flavors of cherry and lime."
US,87.0,20.0,Paso Robles,EOS,"Clean and crisp in acidity, with a rich overlay of smoky, caramelized oak, this Chardonnay has appealing pineapple, peach and lime fruit flavors. There's a honey sweet finish, although the wine itself is totally dry. Good price for all this opulence."
US,84.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Maddalena,"Softness of tannins makes this wine feel melted in the mouth, yet it has bright, zingy acidity, and the raspberry and cherry fruit is sweet and jammy. The result is simple."
US,85.0,11.0,California,Shenandoah,"A value-priced California Zin from the folks at Sobon in Amador County, this wine is jammy in blackberry flavor, meaty with traces of tobacco. While the finish is long it's also piqued with a taste of high alcohol."
US,90.0,16.0,Southern Oregon,Cliff Creek,"Made by consulting winemaker Herb Quady, this yummy blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and (a splash of) Malbec is a showcase for what are arguably Southern Oregon's three best red grapes. Plum and cherry flavors are limned with citrus-tinged acids, making a tasty quaffable red, ready to deliver mid-week pleasure."
Italy,91.0,25.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Le BÃ¨rne,"This 100% Sangiovese opens with pretty aromas of iris, violet, dark berry and a blend of cooking spices. On the palate, ground black pepper, anise and espresso accent a core of dried black cherry while tightly knit, assertive tannins provide backup. Drink 2017??022."
US,93.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Love & Squalor,"This packs tremendous flavor into a low-alcohol wine with moderate residual sugar. Peach pit and juice, green apple and citrusy acids start it off. The flavors keep going through a long, complex finish, adding subtle notes of herb and cut grass."
US,83.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Marilyn,"A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot and 3% each of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this wine tastes of charred wood and generic red juice, accented by a slight green character. Puckering tannins and a diluted finish complete the picture."
US,90.0,40.0,Red Mountain,Ryan Patrick,"The aromas offer notes of dark coffee, baking spice, vanilla, and barrel spices. The palate pulls no punches with full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors along with lightly grainy tannins. The wood plays prominently but it works."
Italy,89.0,40.0,Maremma Toscana,Paniole,"Part of the natural wine movement, this blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon comes from organically farmed fruit. There's a touch of heat on the palate, with aromas of cherry liqueur, jammy blackberry and exotic spice that drive the bold and masculine mouthfeel."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Prosecco di Conegliano,CarpenÃ¨ Malvolti,"Delicate and sweet, this pretty Prosecco offers delicate floral notes and shadings of banana and exotic fruit. It is light and foamy in the mouth with full, soft texture and sensual sweetness on the close."
Italy,94.0,85.0,Barolo,Azelia,"Enticing aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, leather and a hint of baking spice meld together. The juicy, delicious palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and ground pepper. Firm, velvety tannins support the succulent fruit."
US,91.0,36.0,Lake County,Six Sigma Ranch,"This full-bodied wine has a smooth texture that is mouthfilling and rich. It offers mild, savory mineral flavors that complement the creaminess and prolong the finish, while subtle oak flavors contribute to its sense of smoothness and viscosity."
US,86.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Lucas Vineyards,"Impeccably dry, this refreshing, brisk and light-bodied GewÃ¼rztraminer reveals delicate hints of pink grapefruit, lychee and musk. Nervy lemon-lime-like acidity lends a crisp, lean feel."
France,85.0,23.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,LabourÃ©-Roi,"Tropical fruit and melon aromas are filled out with a touch of toast and acidity. The result is a wine that is not quite balanced, with wood and fruit still at odds. The aftertaste, with a creamy texture, is more attractive. This is one of the first vintages since LabourÃ©-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,AlthÃ©a,"White spring flower and apple aromas lift out of the glass. On the palate, bracing acidity and brisk bubbles offset ripe pear and a hint of thyme."
France,90.0,68.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Domaine de Nalys,"Atypical for the appellation in that it's 80% Syrah, this is a dark-fruited, slightly pruny ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape. Chocolate and licorice notes add complexity to this full-bodied, firmly structured wine. With its long, chewy finish, consider deferring consumption until at least 2014."
France,93.0,50.0,Mercurey,Domaines Devillard,"This small Premier Cru vineyard is wholly owned by the Devillard family. It is a rich wine, boasting layers of beautiful jammy red fruits and just the lightest touch of wood. Tannins are there, forming a core that will stand the wine in good stead as it ages. Drink from 2023."
France,86.0,15.0,Ile de BeautÃ©,Domaine de Terra Vecchia,"A pale rose-colored wine, this is attractive, crisp and fresh. Lime and raspberry fruits are cut by tight, lively acidity. Drink now."
US,87.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Arbor Crest,"This wide open Syrah shows berry and heavy vanilla notes. As the flavors wind through the palate, the back end seems to tighten up, and it finishes with a somewhat green, lightly herbal flourish."
US,87.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Koves-Newlan,"Everything about this wine is designed to flatter the palate, from the cherry and black raspberry fruit, dusted with dry crushed spices, to the overlay of richly toasted oak, to the soft, yielding tannins. What's not to like? It ain't grand cru Burgundy, but it sure is nice drinking. ?S.H."
US,90.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Medlock Ames,"From an exceptional vintage, this white is deeply floral, with a burst of honeysuckle and honeycomb that is entirely inviting on the nose. From there, lemon, mango and peach are playful on the palate, creating a wine that's big in flavor but measured in oak, with a candied peach finish."
Italy,93.0,65.0,Toscana,Petra,"Aromas of blue flowers, black-skinned fruit and whiffs of mocha lead the nose on this structured Sangiovese. The full-bodied palate delivers mature plum, fleshy black cherry, clove and Mediterranean herb alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a note of mint chocolate."
US,87.0,40.0,Carneros,Saintsbury,"This shows the dried herb character that often characterizes Napa Chardonnay, giving the pineapple and orange flavors an earthiness. It's very dry and crisp in acidity, but it ultimately trades opulence for elegance. Drink now."
US,88.0,22.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Joyce,"Very light in color, this bottling is one of the first submitted in the vintage. It offers fresh lemon-lime soda, tangerine skin, lime zest and pear-blossom aromas. There's a touch of sweet to the palate, with poached apple, pear cider, tangerine juice and orange-skin flavors. The honeyed element grows quickly as the wine sits open."
US,81.0,12.0,California,Dancing Bull,"Something went south on this wine. It smells and tastes burnt, like it went through a fire, and the simple flavors are like the syrup in canned peaches."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Monferrato,Castello del Poggio,"Aromas of black berry and spice are accompanied by black cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors. Simple but well made, this wine should be enjoyed young to capture the fresh fruit flavors."
France,93.0,53.0,Alsace,Domaine Gresser,The nose is like a veil of Golden Delicious apple scent. The palate follows with soft apple freshness that is pervaded by a deeper lemony streak. But it is apple charm that stays on the surface. There are hints of wax and stone too. The dry intense palate is concentrated and clean. Apple and lemon notes linger and leave the palate utterly clean.
US,91.0,54.0,Columbia Gorge (OR),Phelps Creek,"Elegance and finesse are the touchstones here, with the scaffolding to age for decades. Tight and precise, it shows pomegranate and red-berry fruit, stiff and potent tannins, and plenty of supporting acidity. Drink 2020 to 2030 and beyond."
Australia,88.0,21.0,McLaren Vale,Revolution,"Comes out of the chute a bit tarry and rubbery, but seems to come around with some time in the glass, offering a lush, dense texture and flavors of coffee and black olive that finally show some berry shadings on the finish."
US,87.0,38.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Jorian Hill,"Nice and dry, with a good cut of acidity balancing out the ripe black cherry and cola flavors. Fully drinkable now for the soft tannins, it's a pleasant wine that wants pairing with a grilled, salted and peppered steak."
US,90.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Michael Bernard,"This delightful Sauvignon Blanc is unoaked, and did not undergo malolactic fermentation. The result is pure Russian River fruit, rich and spicy in pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, green apple and fig flavors, brightened with tangy acidity. Delicious and lively, a perfect wine for cocktails and Asian fare."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Soave,Latium di Morini,"Appealing aromas of mature orchard fruit and chopped herb lead the way. The ripe round palate doles out creamy pear, white peach, candied ginger and a hint of bitter almond while just enough fresh acidity gives it a lift."
France,87.0,40.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau Laffitte Carcasset,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017."
US,91.0,16.0,California,Slow Press,"Generous and flavorful, this is one of the best California AVA wines available. It's concentrated and tannic, with medium-full body, a hint of sweetness and layers of dark cherry and plum fruit. Baking spice nuances linger on the finish. Best after 2019."
US,87.0,13.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Mercer,"Made entirely from Grenache, this wine is a pretty pale-salmon color. It drinks off dry, with strawberry flavors and well-balanced acidity, showing some warmth on the finish."
US,88.0,23.0,Elkton Oregon,Monte Ferro,"Sourced from old-vine WÃ¤denswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density."
US,85.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,Bowman Cellars,"Aged entirely in neutral French oak, this wine takes a light, simplistic approach in its presentation of golden honey apple and pear flavor."
US,91.0,50.0,St. Helena,Robert Biale,"From an historic site replanted and restored to new heights, this wine has good grip and high-octane fruit that plays on the palate, veering from jammy to juicy and back again. Anise and black pepper linger on the lengthy finish, with a touch of smoky oak and toffee."
US,83.0,22.0,Anderson Valley,Migration,"The 2006 was really good, but the 2007 is a disappointment. Where that wine was complex, this is simple, tasting of watermelon, cotton candy and LifeSaver cherry flavors that finish watery and sugary."
US,89.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Ousterhout,"Peach-blush in color, this is a pretty, floral and aromatic wine, dry and delicious in peach and strawberry flavors. A hint of herbs marks the finish. Enjoy with a picnic, especially goat cheese and charcuterie."
Italy,90.0,16.0,Lambrusco di Sorbara,Cleto Chiarli,"Fragrant and elegant, this vibrant wine has aromas of crushed violet and spice. The creamy palate doles out juicy wild strawberry, raspberry and cake spice alongside zesty acidity."
Spain,91.0,30.0,Ribera del Duero,ViÃ±a Mayor,"Meaty, rubbery aromas of berry fruits come with hints of minty green and lemony oak. This feels wide and tannic on the palate, with ripe, oaky flavors of berry, cassis, vanilla and licorice. A creamy palate is healthy and completes the wine in fine fashion; drink through 2020."
Spain,84.0,17.0,RÃ­as Baixas,CompaÃ±ia de Vinos del AtlÃ¡ntico,"Briny, pickled aromas come with hints of citrus and flower blossom. This fast-aging AlbariÃ±o is melony in feel, but it lacks the variety's patented kick and acidity. As a result, peach and apricot flavors are fleshy and chunky."
US,84.0,50.0,Calistoga,Jax,"Alcohol gives this wine a hot aroma and taste, as well as sweetness from glycerine. The cherry fruits veer into overripe raisins. Whie the tannins are elegant, the heat limits its appeal, not to mention ageability."
US,89.0,13.0,Clarksburg,Muddy Boot,"As effusive in flavor as a bowl full of orchard fruits, this wine exudes fresh apple, melon and spearmint aromas backed by ripe yet crisp flavors that carry a vein of apple blossoms. It's not sweet, but it has a pleasant softness around the edges of the mouthfeel."
US,95.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Buty,"Beautifully floral, fragrant and evocative, with lush and complex aromas of honeycomb, cracker and citrus, carrying into the mouth with rich, bright, detailed flavors. Stone and mineral elements are woven throughout, and the barrel fermentation adds hints of toast."
US,85.0,12.0,Umpqua Valley,Girardet,"Crisp and clean, stainless steel-fermented, yet showing a lot of tropical fruit in the nose, and a touch (half a percent) of residual sugar. Banana, mango and citrus flavors are there, along with plenty of acidity. Interesting, but not particularly varietal."
France,89.0,36.0,Mercurey,Albert Bichot,"This soft, rounded wine has attractive ripe white-stone-fruit flavor. It also has a rich, spicy side, with light hints of wood that give it a mellow character. The wine is developing well and will be ready from 2017."
Australia,91.0,50.0,Coonawarra,Penley Estate,"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background."
Italy,91.0,48.0,Sagrantino di Montefalco,Lungarotti,Sagrantino is a powerful and densely tannic wine that is gaining popularity in Italy and abroad. Lungarotti works hard to tame this variety through careful oak aging and low yields in the vineyard. The beautiful results boast dark fruit and exotic spice highlights.
US,80.0,30.0,Central Coast,Fallbrook,"There's nothing special about this Syrah. It's not only soft and semisweet, it's thin in fruit, with watered down blackberry jelly flavors."
Argentina,85.0,11.0,Mendoza,Ãko,"Scratchy aromas of raspberry and licorice gumdrop precede a grabby, sticky palate with raw tannins. Plum and berry flavors are standard for Malbec, while the finish shows a mild baked character."
France,90.0,50.0,Saint-EstÃ¨phe,ChÃ¢teau Clauzet,"This dense and dark wine is full of ripe, richly juicy black fruits. Solid tannins and layers of wood are softening into the rest of the wine. It's going to develop slowly, releasing the fruit into the tannic structure. Wait until 2018."
Spain,90.0,25.0,Cigales,Museum,"One of the Cigales region's big new wineries, Museum seems to be getting on track. This wine, from a very hot year, is composed, rich and in good balance. It has a slight baked character that's offset by almond candy, black cherry and toast notes. Black plum is the lead flavor, with coffee and molasses providing a rich background. Drink now and over the next two years."
US,91.0,48.0,Paso Robles,Skyhawk Lane,"An interesting wine for its moderate alcohol and extreme dryness. Leaner and more structured than a plump Napa Cab, it shows juicy blackberry, currant, mineral and oak flavors that are streamlined and elegant. A bite of alcohol makes this pretty wine balanced and clean through the finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Telaya,"Half Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it brings sweet barrel notes of vanilla and coconut along with dried cherry and blueberry. The palate is light to medium bodied with an interplay of chocolate and cherry flavors that keeps things interesting even as the concentration dips."
France,86.0,12.0,Pays d'Oc,Villa des Anges,"Soft, dainty scents of pressed sweet pea, white raspberry and cherry dance in the bouquet, while pithy citrus and cherry-skin flavors unfold on the palate. The midpalate shows a touch of roundness, but brisk acidity and a slight bitterness lifts the close. Drink now."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Fabre Montmayou,"elon and peach aromas create a bouquet that's nondescript. This feels solid in the mouth, with acidic cut. Flavors of nectarine run sweet, while the finish takes on a cloying feel as it delivers thick melon and peach flavors. Drink now or wait for the 2013 vintage."
US,87.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Coniglio,"Soft and melted, like liquid chocolate infused with blackberry and cherry purÃ©e sprinkled with cinnamon and a dash of pepper. For all that, it's perfectly dry. Objectively very good, but would benefit from a firmer structure."
France,85.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Haut Bessac,"This is a hard edged wine, solid and firm, with dry tannins and only a hint of fruity acidity. It does have weight, so it could soften with age."
France,85.0,34.0,Saumur,ChÃ¢teau de Chaintres,"This wood aged Chenin Blanc has a strongly oxidative character. It has lost its fruit in favor of grilled almonds, toast and intense acidity. Drink this mature wine now."
France,87.0,13.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Laudun Chusclan,"This is a bargain-priced blend of Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, MourvÃ¨dre and Cinsault. The flavors are ripe and plummy, accented by hints of garrigue, while the tannins are modest and supple."
US,88.0,18.0,Yakima Valley,Eight Bells,"This has pretty fruit flavors of plums and spicy black cherries. At first the wine seems sharp and slightly warm, but it mellows with air."
France,84.0,10.0,Vin de France,Kiwi CuvÃ©e,"Light scents of lime, white melon rind, green gooseberry and fresh-cut grass dance on the nose of this dainty white, followed by flavors of underripe pear and tart currant on the light-weight palate. It's fresh and lively, finishing short but clean. Drink up."
France,90.0,27.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Pierre Vessigaud,"Good wood, spice, ripe plum juice and balanced acidity. This is a wine with potential, balanced and rich."
France,88.0,20.0,RÃ©gniÃ©,Domaine DuprÃ©,"This is a soft wine with a great depth of red fruits and fresh acidity. The tannins are light, just a hint of dry behind the fragrant, bright fruitiness. The wine, made from old vines, is ready to drink."
US,91.0,42.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tulpen,"A rare single-vineyard bottling from this tiny site, this wine offers aromas of black licorice, herbs, cassis, dates and black cherry. The palate brings tart, vibrant acidity along with chewy tannins."
Argentina,93.0,120.0,La Consulta,Zuccardi,"A lightly charred, foresty nose includes aromas of blackberry, cassis, hard spices, licorice and leather. This is lively but balanced in terms of feel, with richness and raciness playing off each other. Flavors of baked black fruits, peppery spice and licorice finish dark, long and bright, with juicy acidity that will keep this healthy for years to come. Drink through 2024."
US,84.0,13.0,Napa Valley,Courtney Benham,"A country-style red wine, made from indeterminate varieties. It's tough and stringy in the mouth, with earthy berry and tobacco flavors."
US,87.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Atwater,"Striking lemon-lime acidity penetrates through this zesty, dry-style Riesling. It's spry and lean, marked by crisp green apples and pears and finishes briskly, accented by layers of dusty minerals. Drink now??016."
France,91.0,45.0,Beaune,Domaine Jessiaume,"With vines forming part of the 22-acre Jessiaume estate, this vineyard?one of the better known of the Beaune premiers crus?has produced a fine, rich wine in this vintage. Although there is plenty of young wood, the fruit is so rich and generous, with such fine potential. Give this opulent wine until 2022."
Spain,89.0,14.0,Rueda,Valdelainos,"Lime, tarragon and fresh green aromas are a bit minerally and stony in front of a linear, pure palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, peach and nectarine are just right, moderately minerally and fade away with clarity and style. Drink right away."
Argentina,93.0,90.0,Mendoza,El Enemigo,"Round, earthy blackberry aromas are dressed up in dry spice and oak. A fleshy, pure palate has bounce to its step, while oaky, toasty flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and spice finish with just the right amount of cutting acidity and flavors of baking spices. Drink this Cabernet Franc-led blend through 2020."
US,89.0,40.0,Red Hills Lake County,Lake and Vine Cellars,"This densely flavored and full-bodied wine has a very deep, dark color and aromas that suggest oak barrels, nutmeg and cardamom. The palate shows tension between firm tannins and acidity, and carries ripe blackberries, with spicy accents. Drink now through 2020."
US,91.0,28.0,Paso Robles,Zenaida Cellars,"Powerful and elegant aromas of tobacco, dark herbs, cedar and a touch of green pepper keep the nose entertained for quite a while. There's a peppery, meaty character to the palate, with purple fruits arising over time. This one will be even better in a few years."
US,85.0,13.0,Monterey,Noble Vines,"Just a tad honeyed, but crisp acidity helps to provide balance. The apricot, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors are easy to like."
US,94.0,70.0,Anderson Valley,Roederer Estate,"This is as fine a rosÃ© sparkling wine as has ever been produced in California. Almost 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it has rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, vanilla, toast and creamy lees, in the style of Champagne, and is completely dry and very crisp in acidity. Fabulously drinkable now, it should develop well over the next 6?? years."
US,88.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Horan Estates,"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,Astoria,"The nose here is deeply redolent of fresh fruit with distinct tones of peach, apricot, citrus, Granny Smith apple and pear. Additional complexity is added by background tones of spring flowers, almond and baked biscuits."
US,91.0,72.0,Russian River Valley,Small Vines,"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry."
France,88.0,25.0,Sancerre,Domaine des Levrys,"A very herbaceous, aromatic wine. The acidity cuts through the grapefruit flavor, giving a touch of minerality at the end."
US,88.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Dry Creek Vineyard,"Light and crisp, it offers layers of lemon chiffon and spicy pear. The at-first luxurious mouthfeel evolves smoothly into crisper, citrus-wrapped acidity. This is a sippable, ideal summer wine."
France,92.0,43.0,Sancerre,Domaine Vincent Delaporte,"Very ripe and concentrated, this wine offers fruit-forward peach and pear flavors. There is also a hint of mango, and a sense of toastiness and smooth texture, although the acidity is never far away. Give the wine another year to mature."
Italy,84.0,15.0,Prosecco,Foss Marai,"This is a simple and clean Prosecco with medium intensity, little depth and bright fruit layers of peach and tangerine. It's a good choice for very informal drinking occasions."
France,90.0,80.0,Beaune,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Soft, sensuous, this is a wine that appeals straight away to the senses. The red fruits float over a soft texture of sweet tannins, leaving a juicy, succulent texture. While it is not a powerful wine, it offers all the delicious characters of Pinot Noir."
Italy,94.0,180.0,Barolo,Paolo Scavino,"Red rose, mature wild berry, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this gorgeous wine. The structured, elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice pipe tobacco and mocha balanced by firm, silky tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage."
US,88.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hestia Cellars,"This Meritage red blend is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc and 12% Malbec. The fruit flavors are pure and focused, and the wine opens beautifully with tangy boysenberry, plum and wild cherry. The acids carry it aloft, and the tannins, just slightly hinting at green tea, are polished and firm. Though it finishes with some herbal flavors, it is satisfying throughout."
US,89.0,26.0,Santa Barbara County,Addamo,"A big, rich, full-bodied wine that's kind of like Syrah, but with different flavors. There's a warm, baked pie filling taste of black and red cherries, currants, coconut macaroons, licorice, chocolate and violets, and the finish is very long and richly spicy. At its best now and for a couple more years."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Ironstone,"Shows good Chardonnay character in the rich texture and upfront flavors of pineapples, peaches and cream. This is a pretty decent price for the quality."
US,88.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Robert Mondavi,"This is a straightforward, lush and alluringly tart white that offers an oaky backbone of vanilla wrapped in fresh layers of fig, apple and green olive flavor."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Erice,Fazio,"Bright and simple, this has delicate aromas of white stone fruit. The easygoing palate offers white peach and fresh apricot alongside fresh acidity."
US,86.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Broken Earth,"This bottling from winemaker Chris Cameron shows smoky touches of vanilla and caramel on the nose, proving quite ripe and buttery. Dried lemon skin and smoked white meat flavors show on the palate, making this a solid weeknight sipper for anyone who likes a full-bodied Chardonnay."
France,95.0,100.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau Lynch-Bages,"Fragrant and perfumed, this wine is the epitome of great Cabernet Sauvignon. It is fruity, juicy yet with serious concentrated tannins. There is spice from the wood aging along with a dash of pepper, all the while just bringing out the beautiful black-currant flavors. Drink this wine from 2024"
Italy,87.0,18.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,La Vis,"Aromas of coconut, tilled soil and ripe plum lead the nose. The dense, round palate offers toasted oak, chocolate, ripe blackberry and oak-driven spice. Drink soon."
US,92.0,75.0,Napa Valley,ChÃ¢teau Potelle,"Extraordinarily concentrated in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. So strongly sweet in fruit and oak, it's almost undrinkable now, tasting like a melted dessert tart. Yet the minerality, tannins and overall structural integrity strongly suggest ageability. Cellar this young wine until at least 2014."
US,85.0,18.0,Santa Barbara County,Mosby,"Crisp and fruity, this has fig, citrus, apricot and honeysuckle flavors. It seems sweeter than in the past, with a sugary finish, but the acidity helps a great deal to balance that out."
US,88.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Arbor Crest,"This is Bacchus vineyard fruit, as per normal ??these vines are something like 35 years old. It's all stainless-steel fermented, aged on the lees and finished at 13% alcohol. Fruit flavors of peach and pineapple fill the mouth with round, lightly spicy flavors. It's ripe but not sweet, tart but not too citrusy. Good balance and texture through the finish."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Puglia,La Corte,Solyss is a pure expression of Negroamaro that offers mature berry and dark fruit aromas with an earthy layer of exotic spice at the back. Pair this wine with marinated pork barbecue.
US,94.0,50.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Montemar Wines,"Broad, welcoming aromas of strawberry and baked red currant are lifted by mint leaf, star anise and white pepper on the nose. Pure raspberry flavors kick-start the palate, followed by waves of anise, bay leaf and juniper, proving this to be a dynamic and minty sip."
France,92.0,62.0,Champagne,G. H. Mumm,"Now with its intensity and some bottle age, this wine?formerly known as CrÃ©mant de Cramant?is rich, with its apple flavor blending with an almond note and a soft, warm texture. The acidity shoots right through this ripe wine."
US,82.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Meeker,"Syrupy and with a distinct taste of raisins, this 100% varietal wine is overdone in terms of ripeness, with a lack of structure. The highlight is its tight hold on black pepper."
Spain,83.0,15.0,Cava,CodornÃ­u,"Oxidized aromas of spent yeast and stale fruit are not fresh. This feels foamy, wayward and unfocused. Citrus flavors are unconvincing, while this rosÃ© tastes soapy on the finish."
France,92.0,40.0,Cahors,Jean-Luc BaldÃ¨s,"Big, bold and rich wine, solidly tannic, firm and ripe. Vivid black plum flavors scroll across the palate giving a full, firm, right up front feel. The wine has great texture, weight and density. It also has an impressive future, so drink from 2017."
Italy,90.0,49.0,Taurasi,Cantina Dei Monaci,"Sweet oak-driven notes of vanilla, chocolate and spice shape a modern Taurasi with a soft and supple side. The wine is dense and chewy with thick, dark tannins and loads of mineral intensity to fuel a long-lasting finish."
US,87.0,70.0,North Fork of Long Island,Bedell,"Sweeter whiffs of milk chocolate, baking spice and graham cracker accenting black fruit on the nose are replaced by more herbaceous tones of herb and bramble on the palate of this red blend. It's a juicy intensely ripened wine with brisk acidity and bold penetrating tannins on the finish. Drink now through 2021."
US,92.0,32.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"What a fine Chardonnay. Made in a bone dry, minerally style, it may not have the immediately seductive quality of some Chards, but it does show a Chablis-like elegance that makes it a natural for food pairing, with its fine citrus and steel tang and mouthwatering acidity."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Le Bertille,"A little air unlocks aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, blue flower, toasted oak and mature berry. On the firm palate, notes of espresso and licorice add some depth to the core of dried black cherry while grippy, close-grained tannins provide support."
Italy,88.0,42.0,Toscana,MÃ¡tÃ©,"This Montalcino-based Merlot has a lot going on but is just a tad too raw and ripe to break into the 90-points range. On the nose, it offers a mÃ©lange of strawberry, blueberry, almond, balsam notes and mint. The tannins are silky and smooth."
US,92.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Kale,"From a site tucked within the eastern hills of the appellation, this is a 100% varietal expression, dark hay in color, sparkling in minerality and sporting a gravelly edge. Stainless steel and one neutral French oak barrel helped ferment and age. Flinty, it shines in lime, peach and pear."
US,92.0,60.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Babcock,"With low alcohol and a clean minerality, this Pinot represents the new direction that the variety is taking in California, helped by cooler vintages. It's dry, crisply acidic and complex, with the cherry-berry flavors assisted with notes of earthy herb and mushroom. A lovely wine now, and should gently develop over the next six years."
France,90.0,20.0,Bandol,Domaines Bunan,"Situated in the valley on the other side of the hill from Bandol and the sea, this estate has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. The high proportion of MourvÃ¨dre in the blend contributes a perfumed character and some structure. It is a complete, ripe and concentrated wine that will age, and will be better from late 2016."
US,88.0,70.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"This is rich with tannins and a little heavy on the palate with massive, concentrated flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and mocha. Delicious in that classic Napa way, if lacking a bit of finesse. Seems best now and over the next six years."
US,92.0,40.0,Sonoma-Napa,Chandon,"Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, with a splash of Pinot Meunier, this bubbly is, in a word, delicious. It's so easy to drink, you can't put the glass down. Shows classic Champagne structure, with refined bubbles and brisk acidity. But the raspberry, strawberry, lime and apple flavors are pure California."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Cortona,Tenimenti Luigi D'Alessandro,"You'll find blue flowers, blackberry, ground pepper and aromatic herb aromas on this smooth, poised red. The savory palate doles out blackberry, crushed plum, ground pepper and cocoa balanced by supple, fine-grained tannins."
US,88.0,26.0,North Fork of Long Island,Coffee Pot Cellars,"Bold hits of spice and toasted cedar envelop ripe black-cherry and plum flavors in this Merlot-based wine (augmented by proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot). The palate is intensely lush and fruity but anchored neatly by a bitter edge of tannins and cranberry acidity. Should drink well through 2023."
US,90.0,13.0,North Coast,Steelhead Vineyards,"Very fresh and vivacious, this light-bodied wine is refreshing. It smells like lemon, grapefruit and kiwi, tastes bright and tangy like lemonade, but is quite dry. The texture is crisp and vital, and keeps the flavors echoing on the finish."
Italy,90.0,24.0,Lugana Superiore,CÃ  Lojera,"Subtle but pretty aromas of pressed flower, mature pear and honey mingle in the glass. The round, full-bodied palate offers dried apricot, Golden Delicious apple, lemon drop and nuance of cake spice brightened by fresh acidity."
US,90.0,38.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pezzi King,"Dusty pencil shavings mark the nose of this fulsome, generously ripe wine, thick and soft in integrated layers of black licorice, sage and dark chocolate."
US,87.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Merriam,"Spicy in cinnamon and sultry tropical coconut, this wine offers a freshness of red fruit, true and varietal, with soft, lean layers of body and weight."
US,84.0,20.0,Napa Valley,C&T;,"A decent everyday Cab, a little rough around the edges, but dry, flavorful and firm in tannins. Nice and moderate in alcohol, it's ready to drink now."
Argentina,83.0,9.0,Tupungato,AcordeÃ³n,"The nose is neutral except for dusty aromas and a hint of applesauce. This feels bold, thick and a bit clumsy, with pithy citrus, nectarine and apricot flavors. These notes continue through the wine's finish. Drink now."
France,87.0,16.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Louis Chevallier,"Attractive and fruity, this warm wine is crisp and fresh at the same time. Yellow fruits and tangy orange zest are complemented by minerality and a refreshing aftertaste. It is ready to drink."
US,84.0,16.0,New York,Tousey,"Aromas of ripe nectarines entice on the nose of this clean, crisp, medium-bodied Chardonnay. While initially quite soft, there's a tartness towards the midpalate that reflects hints of underripe stone fruit and quince."
US,84.0,25.0,Napa Valley,B Side,"This is a good, sound Cabernet. The blackberry and cherry fruit is candy-jammy, with an oaky overlay."
US,82.0,39.0,Umpqua Valley,Henry Estate,"Borderline translucent in color, and equally light in the nose. The aromas are of cranberry and chlorine. The palate is all strawberry and some bitter oak, and while it picks up steam and fills out with time, the initial impression is hard to overcome."
US,92.0,38.0,Central Coast,Bonny Doon,"There's a bit more fruit?cherry, cranberry?and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% MourvÃ¨dre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce"
US,92.0,54.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Fairly tannic and very dry, with ripe, jammy flavors of cherries and raspberries that taste like they were baked into a pie sprinkled with cocoa and cinnamon, and then drizzled with anisette liqueur. Should develop additional bottle complexity over the next six years."
Spain,81.0,9.0,Spain,Arrumaco,Jabbing red-berry aromas are a bit dusty and yeasty. This wine feels rubbery and astringent. Raw flavors of tomato and herbs finish hard.
US,85.0,22.0,Napa County-Sonoma County-Lake County,Aquinas,"This red sources from across three appellations and four varieties, all aged in a mix of French and American oak for one year. That oak imparts a smoky element around thick, concentrated baked fruit and big, lasting tannin weight, showing plenty of leathery tobacco."
France,85.0,22.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau du Barrailh,"Herbaceous and aromatic, this is a crisp, green-fruit- and citrus-flavored wine. Grapefruit and green apple dominate the texture with its zesty character. Not for aging."
US,86.0,20.0,Virginia,Breaux,"A smoky narcissus note is upfront and almost obtrusive, with brooding notes of spiced black fruit and char lurking in the background. The tannins are drying?with the consistency of finely ground sand?and they constrict the flavors a bit. A food wine for sure, it needs to be paired with a slab of rare meat."
US,86.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Lucas Vineyards,"Freshly scented of apple and yellow peaches, this fairly dry Riesling gains softness from a sweet white grapefruit juice note. Brisk with a lemon pith astringency and notes of slate and chalk that linger through a clean, minerally finish."
US,89.0,38.0,Contra Costa County,Cinnabar,"This savory, spicy wine is relatively light but offers a tasty combination of non-fruit flavors such as black pepper, beef broth and wood smoke. It's medium bodied, lightly tannic and quite complex for its moderate concentration."
Argentina,87.0,50.0,Uco Valley,Antucura,"This vintage seems more medicinal and overtly ripe than the more balanced 2003. It has high alcohol (15.2%) and medium acidity, thus it's a touch gummy and syrupy. But if you like power at the core of your Cabernet-Merlot blends and you don't mind a little fire in the hole after drinking, then we recommend this chewy, ripe, very modern offering."
US,82.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Truett Hurst,"Simple and cloying in white sugar notes. Too bad, because there's good acidity and succulent citrus and tropical fruit flavors."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Alto Adige,Nals Margreid,"This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time. Measured aromas include melon, apricot, grapefruit and a touch of vanilla spice."
US,85.0,13.0,Willamette Valley,Abiqua Wind,"This has a sweet charm to it, with a rich lemon flavor. This would be fine as a light dessert wine with lemon cake."
US,89.0,24.0,Monticello,Trump,"Deliciously biscuity on the nose with hints of candied orange peel, this structured blanc de blanc balances a soft biscotti sweetness with delightfully high acidity and a creamy, gentle froth. Brisk, lemony finish."
US,87.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,RouteStock,"Moderately full and roundly fruity, with an undertone of mineral or concrete. This is a nicely managed blend, with the balance and grip to age for another five years."
US,91.0,36.0,Alexander Valley,Bella,"This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices."
US,84.0,18.0,Los Carneros,Laurier,"Like a fruit juice drink, with sugary pineapple, mango and orange flavors. The acidity is bright, but this Chardonnay is more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Friuli Isonzo,Ronco del Gelso,"Aromas of citrus blossom, white stone fruit and a whiff of wet flint float from the glass. Fresh and savory, the juicy palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, yellow apple, nectarine and lemon drop alongside bright acidity. Notes of almond and ginger add depth."
France,90.0,33.0,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,"The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game."
US,88.0,60.0,Red Mountain,Fidelitas,"Being 100% varietal, aromas of barrel spice are prominent at present, followed by black fruit. The fruit flavors are sweet but still lighter in style, with lightly grainy tannins backing them up. It's surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage and region."
Spain,92.0,35.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Might this be the best wine MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres has produced? The vintage is one of Spain's greatest, and gran reserva is supposed to be Rioja in its loftiest form. So indulge in this beauty's rock-solid structure, lovely violet and raspberry aromas, and long, stout finish. Best from 2012??018."
US,89.0,14.0,Oregon,A to Z,"Springtime in a bottle! This is fairly bursting with aromas of fruit and flower, and carries them into bright strawberry flavors with a gentle touch of sweetness."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Morellino di Scansano,Castello di MontepÃ²,"Made from 95% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine leads with aromas of violet and red berry. The juicy palate delivers layers of sour cherry, cinnamon and white pepper alongside firm but polished tannins. It has both structure and finesse and while it already has depth, it will develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2014??019."
US,84.0,30.0,Mendocino Ridge,Greenwood Ridge,"Greenwood suggests cellaring this wine for four years but in the meantime it's more baked bread than earthy, red fruit and pretty high in acidity."
US,87.0,24.0,Napa Valley,V. Sattui,"A fine Sauvignon Blanc, ripe, dry and pure in pineapple, lime green apple and oak flavors. Feels a little sweet and simple in the finish, but a fancy, crisp wine."
US,88.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Le Vigne,"Condensed blackberry aromas meet with fresh elderberry and frozen strawberry on the diversely fruit-forward nose of this bottling of the notoriously dark grape. The flavors are also black fruit-driven, but with touches of coffee and leather to deliver depth."
US,92.0,47.0,Bennett Valley,MacLaren,"From a pocket of Sonoma County becoming known for quality Syrah, this wine is dense in jammy strawberry and blackberry flavors, with powerful espresso and compost notes?a celebration that's equal parts fruit and earth. Its expansive tannins suggest it will benefit from cellaring; enjoy 2020??024."
US,83.0,52.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Sunstone,"This Bordeaux blend from Sunstone has been getting softer, sweeter and more melted over the years. This latest bottling is almost like a dessert wine, with pastry-like cherry, currant, cocoa, anise and vanilla flavors. It lacks structure and full dryness."
US,89.0,12.0,California,HandCraft,"HandCraft has been consistently good with this grape, and this complex wine is another excellent example. Intriguing aromas of wood smoke and rosemary lead to concentrated fruit flavors like pomegranate and cranberry. The mouthfeel is layered and nicely tannic, and flavors seem to go deep."
US,88.0,28.0,Sierra Foothills,Stark,"This wine was fermented half in stainless steel and half in neutral oak, and did not undergo malolactic fermentation. The result is a textured, rich explosion of honeysuckle, spice and lemon zest flavors that finishes with a minerally, flinty character."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Cava,Mont MarÃ§al,"The nectarine and mild vanilla aromas are subdued yet solid. On the palate, it's all about stone fruit flavors, such as peach and nectarine, with apple and cider notes on the balanced and healthy finish."
US,94.0,85.0,Calistoga,Davies,"Winfield is up-valley in Calistoga, on the lower slopes of Mount St. Helena, where volcanic soils rule. Rich and grippy, this beautiful wine is savory and elegantly bold, a mix of black pepper, leather saddle and blackberry compote, its concentration complemented by streaks of acidity and lurking freshness. It should do well in the cellar for the patient who can painfully wait."
US,87.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"Firm, well-modulated and medium-bodied, this estate-grown wine brings a mix of apple flesh and skin, along with a strong scent of biscuit. and hint of vanilla. Overall it's staunchly varietal, though not especially complex."
Spain,88.0,18.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Vionta,"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of AlbariÃ±o, and for the most part it nails it. Aromas of peach and nectarine are youthful and pure, while the flavors of apple, peach and lime are pleasant. Not over the top but instead it achieves balance and ease. Imported by Freixenet, USA."
France,86.0,39.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaines Ott,"The nose is fresh and pretty and there's definitely a luxurious texture to the flower-accented palate. However, it lacks intensity in the mouth and a slight funkiness on the finish detracts. Drink soon."
US,91.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Bell,"This young, vigorous Cabernet is full of ripe, upfront fruity flavors, yet it's dry and complex, and is grounded by a pleasing tug of herbaceousness. Most notable is the rich blackberry, raspberry and currant fruit, and the way the sweet, smoky oak complements it. Drink now for freshness."
US,87.0,20.0,Paso Robles,Twisted Paso,"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Syrah and 20% Zinfandel is a little simple at first on the nose, with loamy soil and tart elderberry aromas eventually apparent. It's quite dry on the sip, with dried oregano and marjoram, and then come flavors of black fruit, graphite and black pepper."
Australia,92.0,27.0,Barossa Valley,Glaetzer,"Roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Grenache, this is a full-bodied, lush example of Barossa Valley product. Hints of mint and cracked pepper add nuance to the ripe raspberry fruit, while spice and red-fruit nuances linger on the supple yet spine-tingling finish. Drink now??020 for its youthful exuberance."
US,90.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,King Estate,"Half estate, half Pfeiffer Vineyard fruit, this is crisp and racy, with bright intense flavors of white peach and gooseberry. It's bracing, clean and thoroughly refreshing?great for a hot summer day."
US,87.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Silver Horse,"Enormously rich and ripe with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, gingerbread and caramel, this Malbec-based blend has soft, complex tannins. Its best opened soon, to drink with beef dishes."
US,88.0,40.0,Sonoma Valley,St. Francis,"A huge Zinfandel, with ultraripe, powerful berry, cocoa, bacon and spice flavors. That tremendous power comes at the cost of exceptionally high alcohol, which gives the wine a chili pepper burn. Forewarned is forearmed."
France,89.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine de la SangliÃ¨re,"A buoyant wine, this has delicious acidity and a soft, immediately accessible texture. Red berries give a lively, perfumed fruitiness to this open wine that smells and tastes of sunshine."
US,89.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Bjornstad,"A fine blend, showing bright acidity and classic citrus and tropical fruit flavors, with a firm minerality. Oak brings a sweet edge of buttered toast and vanilla. Drink now."
US,92.0,50.0,Napa-Sonoma,Chandon,"With a deep, shiny color of copper and peach blush, you can tell this sparkling wine will be somewhat full-bodied and rich. And it is. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's a big, flamboyant bubbly, rich in raspberries, limes and yeast. Yet it retains the delicacy and elegance of a fine sparkling wine."
US,90.0,40.0,Sonoma County,Pride Mountain,"From Pride's estate 2,100 feet up in the Mayacamas, another in a string of impressive Viogniers. Follows the pattern of tempering the varietal's over the top character with barrel fermentation and lees aging. The result is a wine with the density of a big Chardonnay, but with Viognier's rich, yummy array of fruity flavors."
France,91.0,24.0,Muscadet,Gadais PÃ¨re et Fils,"Wood-fermented Muscadet is rare and this limited edition from 40-year-old vines is certainly unusual. The toast and spice have taken away the natural fruitiness of the Melon grape while adding a richer texture and a ripe, full-bodied ageworthy feel. Drink from 2017."
US,84.0,36.0,Carneros,Apsara,"Perhaps made in a light-bodied style, this wine comes off as herbal and a touch green, with a dullness on the palate. Aged in 30% new French oak, it takes on a taste of coffee bean that intrigues."
US,89.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"This attractive, medium-sweet Riesling keeps the alcohol low. Generous apple and apricot fruit flavors make it a fine warm-weather sipper. Start out any picnic with a chilled bottle of this bright and vividly fruity wine, and you're on the right track."
US,88.0,52.0,Sonoma Coast,Nicholson Ranch,"Cherry-vanilla and cola provide a voluptuous, full-bodied outline for this estate-grown wine, given 20 months in French oak, one-quarter of it new."
US,85.0,29.0,Dry Creek Valley,6 North,"A rugged, fierce wine, brusque in tannins, that needs big, rich meats and oils to balance it out. Short ribs and similar fare will play well against the blackberry and raisin flavors of this high-alcohol Zin."
Italy,84.0,18.0,Casorzo,Ricossa,"This sweet, frizzy wine opens with a dark ruby color and offers a veritable aromatic explosion. You get it all here: from blueberry and raspberry to sweet spice and cinnamon cream. From the Casorzo region of Piedmont, the wine is fresh and intensely fragrant. Pair it with cold cuts and salumi."
France,86.0,15.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"Soft and creamy, this has good intensity of flavor. Ripe pear and red apple flavors introduce a soft, rounded texture and a rich, ripe finish. Screwcap."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Navarra,Castillo de Monjardin,"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods."
Italy,94.0,90.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Stefano Accordini,"Stefano Accordini's vineyard-designate Amarone opens with big oak and Spanish cedar tones that will undoubtedly come into focus with more aging time in the cellar. The wine shows excellent concentration and long flavors of spice, black fruit and tobacco. Pair it with sharp pecorino cheese."
France,90.0,26.0,Gaillac,Domaine Rotier,"This poised late-harvest blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc tastes lightly honeyed, with an edge of dry botrytis. Perhaps more prominent are the dried apricot and spice notes, along with balanced acidity. Intense and in need of more aging, it will be best from late 2018."
Italy,94.0,117.0,Barolo,Michele Chiarlo,"Important and sophisticated, this has aged gracefully over the years. The style is bold and modern and you can feel the soft, oak-derived tannins and the complimentary fruit tannins that give this wine incredible structure and staying power. The bouquet is redolent of ripe fruit, leather, spice, black cherry and pressed violet."
US,88.0,29.0,Willamette Valley,Firesteed,"Firesteed gives even its modestly-priced mid-tier Pinot extra time in bottle, which smoothes out the leafy flavors and softens up the tannins. It holds onto secondary fruit flavors of cooked rhubarb and strawberry, adding in hints of resin, herb and lemon oil."
US,86.0,50.0,Monticello,Veritas,"Charred blackberries and deep caramel notes make up the nose of this wine named after the cellar master. Medium in feel, the palate shows a decent roundness, however racing acids cut the midpalate short. Additional black fruit carry the flavors, with black pepper marking the finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"More full-bodied than the past couple of vintages, the 2012 Estate bottling features fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry, a light sprinkling of peppery herb, and drying tannins, with a bit of clay in the aftertaste."
Italy,87.0,11.0,Collio,CormÃ²ns,"Fruity and exuberant, it's loaded with tropical fruit, yellow peach, apricot and honeydew melon sensations. The round, juicy palate is energized by fresh acidity."
France,88.0,16.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Vignobles Carreau Selection,"This 10-acre vineyard in the Carreau portfolio is surrounded by a stone wall (which is unusual for Bordeaux). The wine with its firm tannins is still very young. But with a structure and with balanced fruitiness it will develop well. There is plenty of fine, juicy acidity at the end. Drink from 2019."
US,86.0,14.0,Yakima Valley,Bergevin Lane,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green herbs along with plum and reductive notes. It's full bodied in feel with scratchy tannins."
US,91.0,45.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Coquelicot,"Cassis and elderberry scents pair perfectly with tobacco and loamy dust aromas in this serious blend of 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec. Tobacco accents the black fruit on the palate as well, with dill, anise and charcoal touches. It's firmly structured and bone dry."
US,87.0,28.0,Lodi,Domenico,"This has a brownish color at the rim and is marked by an earthy, leathery aroma. The wine has flavors like roasted tomatoes and black olives and feels soft and easy in texture. It's full bodied, but very mellow, mature and easy to drink. The blend is 85% Sangiovese, with Syrah, Primitivo and Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,92.0,59.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"This Pinot's immediate lusciousness belies its complexity. Your first impression is of ripe raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie. Then layers of minerals, mushrooms, cola and earthier fruits like persimmons and rhubarbs appear, all made brisk by amazing acidity and finishing bone dry. Lovely now and over the next six years, after an hour or two in the decanter."
US,93.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Boheme,"Enormously attractive, this has a rich, creamy texture and complex flavors. Notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper and persimmons flood the palate, riding a wave of spice, smoky oak and a beautiful touch of mushroomy earthiness. This is a first class Pinot Noir, with food-friendly elegance."
France,92.0,54.0,Hermitage,Delas FrÃ¨res,"A concentrated wine, although with some of the delicacy of the 1998 vintage, showing structure, tannins and ripeness. The finish is full of chocolate and sweet coffee flavors. The acidity gives a sense of elegance and lightness which suggests this will develop relatively fast."
US,88.0,24.0,Sonoma Coast,Apriori,"Made from 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Syrah, this ethereal wine is pillowy in candied aromas of lemon and lime. Pinkish-copper in color, it's light, bright and succulent, and then finishes dry and with brevity."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Mirassou,"A slightly tawny or pink color, characteristic of this variety's grape skins, helps this wine stand out. Aromas like ripe pears and apples lead to vivid, tangy apple and apricot flavors and rather light body."
France,89.0,26.0,Chablis,William FÃ¨vre,"For simple Chablis, this is impressive, rich, fruity, with wood as well as lively, fresh acidity. Nosings find toast and butter, with a hint of light honey."
US,93.0,125.0,Oakville,Oakville East,"The name is silly, but the wine is serious. The winemaker wisely blended in some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot to add structure to Cab Franc's seductive fruit. It's rich in cherries and raspberries, with great acidity and tannins. It's pretty oaky, but the fruit stands up to it. What a beauty with a great steak. Drink now??018."
France,88.0,70.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity."
US,87.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Apolloni,"This is a light easy-drinking style that fills the quaffable white wine bill quite nicely. It's lemony and tart, with a slice of orange peel for extra interest."
US,85.0,10.0,California,Newman's Own,"This delivers great Pinot-like character for its price tier. Give it credit for the dry silkiness, clean acidity and vibrant cherry, cola and oak flavors."
France,92.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau la Vivonne,"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017."
France,92.0,96.0,Morey-Saint-Denis,Domaine Dujac,"Big, tannic and fruity, giving an intense structure of black plums laced with sweet raspberries. It exudes richness and power, generous while also firm."
US,91.0,62.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Clos de la Tech,"From the estate vineyard of a winery founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley mogul TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, the grapes must be picked by a special tractor-on-wires because they are so steeply planted. Like the other 2009s, this Pinot Noir is characterized by strong tannins, meaning that it will last. Unlike the others, this one boats a more mushroom-driven nose between shiitake and porcini, with a touch of mocha. The palate reveals caramelized raspberry, graphite and silty flavors."
Spain,87.0,52.0,Priorat,Scala Dei,"Schisty minerality infiltrates blackberry, cassis and raisin aromas. In the mouth, this is fully saturated and jammy. Flavors of blueberry and raisin suggest borderline overripeness, while the finish is jammy and pinched."
US,89.0,30.0,Potter Valley,Paul Dolan,"Tempting aromas of cherries, raspberries, earth and light spices precede lively flavors of cherry, cinnamon and clove. These partner with medium body and a gentle texture that has just a touch of crispness and tannin."
US,87.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Robert Hall,"Fresh and zesty on the nose, this bottling offers lemongrass, lime peel and kiwi scents, with floral jasmine undertones. The palate delivers loads of zing?an almost effervescent energy and verve?with Bosc pear, apple and honeysuckle flavors."
US,83.0,26.0,Yakima Valley,Westport Winery,"Mostly Sangiovese, this wine appears to have seen some oxygen exposure that interferes with its blue fruit and herb aromas. It drinks quite sweet with a mixture of chocolate and cherry flavors."
US,86.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Pace,"Shows ripe blackberry, grilled meat, white pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into the smooth tannins that Santa Ynez Valley Syrahs usually have. The finish is properly varietally spicy, though there are limiting factors of green notes and excessive acidity."
Spain,91.0,15.0,Jerez,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,"A sensuous sweet Sherry, this has the full monty of fig, date, licorice, root beer and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's naturally thick and sweet but also balanced, so it doesn't come across like a spoonful of syrup. Great as a dessert wine with cake or blue cheese, but also as a topping for vanilla or coffee ice cream."
France,85.0,20.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Jean Faux,"Small production from five acres with biodynamic techniques, the wine is perfumed, full of candied flavors. It has acidity and a zesty texture with a juicy, green plum character. The aftertaste is ripe and full-bodied. StÃ©phane Derenoncourt consults for owner Pascal Collotte."
US,95.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pirouette,"A four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, this packs 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Refined and elegant, it is precisely structured, with a firm herbal attack and a perfect blend of berry and cassis flavors. It's dense, deep and compact, suggesting long aging ahead."
US,90.0,42.0,Santa Barbara County,Casa Dumetz,"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come."
France,85.0,11.0,CÃ´tes du Lot,ChÃ¢teau Saint-Sernin,"A full and rounded wine, touched by caramel as well as red plum and ripe strawberries. It is generous, with a soft, open aftertaste. There is a light texture from the acidity that creeps in at the end."
US,84.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Montinore,"This brings off-putting aromas of barnyard, compost and rubber, without the fruit to compensate. Thin dilute berry flavors are buried in the mix, and it feels flat in the mouth."
US,92.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Januik,"This wine comes from one of Washington's top vineyards, best known for Cabernet Sauvignon, however this Malbec seems to shine as well. Almost 100% varietal, it boasts vibrant plum, coffee, clove, vanilla and herb aromas. The palate is loaded with plump, creamy fruit and an oak note of lingering espresso."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Bolgheri,Podere Guado al Melo,"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this shows bright, balanced aromas of berry, spice and almond. Touches of forest floor, bramble and crisp fruit bring up the rear."
Spain,87.0,70.0,Rioja,Rioja Vega,"Piercing on the nose, with hickory smoke, char and exotic boysenberry aromas. Feels high in acid and low in density, with a tight and biting mouthfeel along with heavily oaked flavors of berry fruit, vanilla, butter and coconut. Very fresh and colorful, but lacking in stuffing and complexity."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Maremma Toscana,Podere San Cristoforo,"Bright and elegant, this opens with aromas of blue flower, woodland berry, baking spice and a whiff of toasted oak. The sleek, savory palate doles out sour cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and a hint of thyme alongside polished tannins."
Spain,86.0,12.0,Rioja,El Coto,"The first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued. The palate brings good weight and lightly leafy, tomatoey accents to red cherry and raspberry flavors. Light, dry and a little stemmy on the finish. Standard but hinting at elegant."
France,91.0,35.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Haut Bertinerie,"Hugely tannic, this formidable wine has great weight, richness and a dark and dense structure. Juicy berry fruits, sweet plum flavors and a dry, concentrated backdrop promise aging. Drink from 2018."
Argentina,84.0,11.0,Patagonia,Bodega NQN,"This smells bland but clean, with a hint of citrus. It feels spritzy but simple, with papaya, green melon and mild citrus flavors. Good in a very basic way, but drink now before it fades."
Spain,88.0,20.0,CariÃ±ena,Monasterio de las ViÃ±as,"Saucy and spicy up front, this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo and Carignan also smells a bit leafy and tar-like. A fresh, tomatoey palate suggests spaghetti sauce, while dry, spicy, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with mint and additional spice notes."
US,91.0,35.0,Alexander Valley,Hall,"This intriguing and delicious wine includes 15% Viognier, the two grapes spending nine months in French oak, only 30% of it new. The oak provides structure and strength in unobtrusive ways, allowing the freshness of pomelo and grapefruit to speak and remain tangy against a tease of vanilla. The finish is dry and lengthy."
US,85.0,25.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Paraiso Vineyards,"Made from a Portuguese variety, this Port-style wine has a residual sugar of 8%. The flavors veer toward blackberries and dark chocolate. It's also very tart. Yet it doesn't deliver enough richness, and it finishes hot. Your mouth longs for more fruit, richness, complexity. Drink now."
US,89.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Januik,"Though it's 92% Cabernet Sauvignon, this includes a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The pretty, floral nose is all about rose petals and milk chocolate. It tightens up in the mouth and battens down with blueberry, blue plum, milk chocolate and a somewhat astringent finish. A streak of smoke and tar runs through the tannins."
US,88.0,50.0,McMinnville,Youngberg Hill Vineyards,"A reserve selection from the winery's Jordan Block, this brings similar flavors with slightly more intensity. Black fruits, black pepper and some spice from barrel aging combine in a medium-bodied effort with moderate aging potential."
Spain,87.0,30.0,Rioja,FernÃ¡ndez de PiÃ©rola,"Opens with leathery aromas suggestive of animal hide along with a leafy element and nuttiness. Airing reveals a compact, medium-intensity palate with baked, roasted, fairly sweet berry flavors. Finishes sweet and mildly leafy."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Toscana,Ca' Marcanda,"Aromas of black berries, dark spices and tobacco take the lead in this blend of 55% Merlot, 35% Syrah and 10% Sangiovese. The dense palate delivers juicy but restrained black cherry accented with notes of black pepper, licorice and mocha alongside firm, dusty tannins. A warm note of alcohol on the close makes the wine seem even more structured than it is."
US,88.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Rodney Strong,"Red raspberry and cherry offer a depth of fruit flavor in this full-bodied, robust wine that's buoyed by moderate acidity. The cherry is seasoned in baking spice and black tea, as accents of toasted oak lean into rich vanilla."
US,94.0,52.0,Napa Valley,Robert Biale,"From the only producer to source Zin from this famous vineyard, this wine is abundant in a complexity of baked bread, blackberry jam and vanilla, with endless depth on the palate. Fresh and juicy, it balances its fruitiness with mountain-sized tannin strength and concentration."
US,86.0,25.0,Edna Valley,Bodegas M,"The combination of mouthwatering acidity, steely flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, white flowers and honey, and finesse make this slightly oaked AlbariÃ±o super drinkable. With a trace of honey, it will be perfect with Vietnamese fare, smoky ham dishes, or fried chicken with potato salad."
Spain,92.0,25.0,Rioja,Maetierra Dominum,"An attractive mix of spiced plum, fresh tomato, herb, tobacco and vanilla aromas are the intro to this excellent wine from a not-good vintage. The palate is creamy but vital, with roasted plum, integrated oak and savory flavors. A smooth but intense finish brings this home. Drink through 2019."
US,90.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Ottimino Vineyards,"A wildly flavored, tannic and exuberant Zinfandel that showcases the variety's exotic personality. Dry and full-bodied, it has brambly flavors of blackberries, black currants, licorice, mocha and smoky cedar, liberally sprinkled with dusty Asian spices. Drink now??013."
US,92.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Elevation Cellars,"This is an almost picture-perfect example of an excellent Washington Merlot, loaded with rich fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. The mouthfeel is satiny, the tannins round and ripe, with a smooth and supple finish."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Molise,Borgo di Colloredo,"Made with Montepulciano and Aglianico grapes, this is a very fragrant and intense rosÃ© with intact berry notes and a wonderfully full and vibrant personality. More berry flavors appear in the mouth and the wine offers a touch of sour almond on the close."
US,89.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"Peppery and trending toward stemmy flavors, this has a phenolic bite. The brambly berry fruit runs quickly into a slightly warm finish."
US,92.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Armida,"Just 10% of this wine was fermented in new French oak which adds a bit of weight and length. Grapefruit, peach and lime mingle on the palate, a briny afterthought providing an edge. Smooth and refreshing, it ends in a long dream of lemon."
France,84.0,17.0,Alsace,Cave de Cleebourg,"This wine is muted, attractively balanced while missing the spicier character of Gewurztraminer. Light and uncomplicated, it's ready to drink, best as an apÃ©ritif."
France,86.0,12.0,Bordeaux Clairet,ChÃ¢teau de Marsan,"Very much a food wine, this has a strong tannic element as well as red-plum flavors. It is rich, dry and full bodied showing a touch of pepper at the end."
US,87.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pendulum,"This blend of Petit Verdot (28%), Malbec (27%), Syrah (20%), Cabernet Sauvignon (16%) and Merlot (9%) leads with wild blueberry, crushed flower, herb, vanilla and spice aromas. Soft, elegant blueberry flavors follow, persisting on the finish. Light on the midpalate, it still brings appeal."
US,90.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Krutz,"A fruity bouquet of dark plum and blueberry is prominent in this 100% varietal wine, from a mountainous vineyard site known for tannic strength. The power is there but it's nicely managed, allowing the velvety texture and a balance of weight to shine through, topped off on the finish in dried herb."
US,94.0,62.0,Fort Ross-Seaview,Dutton-Goldfield,"A vineyard in view of neighbors Hirsch and Martinelli, this prime coastal site is put to spectacular use here. High-toned in crisp cranberry and raspberry, this wine offers wave upon wave of nuanced orange peel and dried herb, with bursts of black cherry along the way."
US,87.0,24.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"This is a Bordeaux blend; the winery's entry-level Cabernet. What that means, say the winemakers, is that it's made to be a little softer, more fruit forward?a wine for immediate pleasure. Most is estate (Walla Walla) fruit, despite the Columbia Valley designation. It's soft and fruity, with strawberry and juicy fruit/tropical flavors. Not exactly plump, but broad and generous, with a little spicy kick to the finish."
US,93.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (OR),Sineann,"These Pines Vineyard vines are nearing a century in age. In the new vintage, the wine seems almost brutally powerful, with rough, rugged oak flavors that will want further bottle age to mellow. Ripe blueberry and cherry tones are matched to strong streaks of caramel, cocoa and coconut. Drink 2018??5."
US,88.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Paraduxx,"This blend, which is mainly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, is robust. It's a trattoria or bistro wine, dry, tannic and spicy, with earthy flavors. Drink now with rich foods to tease out the berry fruit."
US,86.0,13.0,Monterey,Vinum,"Cooked plums, ripe strawberries, cola and a bit of clove make for an interesting nose on this bottling from a reliable and widely accessible producer. The palate shows slate, rust and pencil shavings as well as nutmeg and sour cranberries."
US,89.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Buehler,"A fine Cabernet, this is dry, full bodied and softly tannic, with real Napa elegance. Feels smooth in the mouth, offering concentrated blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak flavors. Drink over the next six years."
US,89.0,18.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),SuLei,"This rare Walla Walla Roussanne comes on crisply with a mix of melon, pineapple and lime. It's tart and fresh and lightly minty, with persistent and clean fruit flavors."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Toscana,Guicciardini Strozzi,This hot vintage Sangiovese plays an even game in terms of elegance and harmony. You need to give it some time before the cherry and vanilla nuances come to full force. The wine also builds on the palate thanks to its natural structure and persistence.
US,94.0,75.0,Rutherford,Honig,"This 100% Cabernet's dark, saturated color testifies to its extracted ripeness and richness. It's a gigantic wine, buried at the moment under smoky oak, but tremendous underneath in blackberry, cherry, currant, sweet herb, violet and cured meat flavors. A big success even in this vintage. Now, with decanting, and through 2019."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Salta,Tercos,"Vanilla and Animal Cracker aromas fold in mango and banana. The palate is soft and creamy, with not much acidity and pulpy flavors of ripe banana and pithy citrus. Soft and peachy on the finish."
France,84.0,12.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Sainte Barbe,"This structured wine has ripe black fruits followed by red berries. There is a good depth of flavor, the tannins giving the bright fruit weight and a mouthfilling character."
US,87.0,13.0,California,Avant,"The light herbal and citrus aromas of this medium-bodied wine lead to light grassy, herbal, grapefruity flavors. A good backing of acidity keeps it lively."
US,83.0,12.0,California,Carmenet,"As sweet as a dessert wine. Tastes like sugared pineapple, apricot and orange juice. Fine in cleansing acidity, but it's not really a dry table wine."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Zenato,"Here's a spicy selection, with aromas of black pepper and cherry accompanied by smoky tones. The palate delivers ripe black-cherry and white pepper flavors in a fresh and enjoyable style that's meant to be drunk young."
US,88.0,45.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Cima Collina,"Dark red cherry and raspberry blend with the slightest hints of thyme and slate on the nose of this bottling, which is made in a urban facility in the coastal city of Marina. There is a tangy cran-raspberry element to the sip, enhanced by licorice spice."
Italy,90.0,27.0,Veronese,Tommasi,"This is a very attractive and well-constructed blend of Corvina, Oseleta and Cabernet Franc with generous aromas of spice, cherry and blackberry. There's also a hint of forest floor and leather at the back and the wine imparts a bright, polished feel in the mouth."
France,89.0,43.0,Chorey-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Chorey-lÃ¨s-Beaune, on the plain just north of Beaune, can offer?as here?good value for Burgundy. This wine, still showing some young austerity, has the potential to develop into a bold, fruity selection that will always have a firmer structured edge."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Rosso Conero,Umani Ronchi,"Made from 100% Montepulciano, this delicious, friendly wine is loaded with mouthwatering black cherry layered with mint, nutmeg and black pepper. It's round, ripe and extremely approachable so enjoy soon. Pair with everything from hearty pasta dishes to barbecue fair."
US,89.0,35.0,Sta. Rita Hills,a-non-ah-mus,"Richly textured and full-bodied, a wine to drink now with fine steaks and chops. Almost sweet, it's opulent in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with a decadent hint of chocolate. But it's fully dry."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Lugana,Ottella,"Herbaceous aromas of hay and tomato leaf meld together with notes of stone fruit, citrus and flint. The round, medium-bodied palate offers white grapefruit, candied nectarine zest, white peach, aromatic herb and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors."
Argentina,88.0,19.0,Agrelo,Lamadrid,"Opens with hard-baked berry aromas that turn briary and herbal with airing. Smooth tannins and meaty blackberry flavors are matched by barrel-driven vanilla and spice. Oaky and minty on the finish, with spunk and length."
Italy,91.0,65.0,Toscana,Cennatoio,"This is a very pretty blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet with well-defined notes of black cherry, leather, tobacco, chocolate, bramble and maple syrup. Recognizable oak renderings establish a refined and sophisticated feel and offer background notes of toasted nut and spice. The wine delivers fresh berry flavors, tight tannins and cool freshness on the finish. Drink after 2010."
US,87.0,20.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Ross Andrew,"Aromas of hazelnut, mineral and pear lead to off-dry, full-feeling fruit flavors that are stitched up with citric acidity on the finish. It doesn't entirely come together but there's plenty to enjoy."
US,85.0,25.0,Applegate Valley,Plaisance Ranch,"This fails to overcome its thin, unripe fruit. Strong scents of smoke and oak carry into the flavors, bringing a bitter end to the finish."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Soave Classico,Nardello,"Aromas of toasted oak, candied citrus, pressed white flower and vanilla lead the nose and follow through to the palate, along with nectarine zest and baked apricot. Enjoy soon to capture the remaining freshness and fruit."
France,92.0,30.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016??020."
France,87.0,25.0,Irancy,Simonnet-Febvre,"This is a warm and round wine from Irancy, southwest of Chablis. Red fruits are sustained by some wood aging that smoothes out the stalky texture and spice. It's a wine that could age another couple of years to soften it further."
US,89.0,40.0,Red Mountain,Tamarack Cellars,"Dark-blue fruit, thyme, sweet barrel spices and mineral aromas lead to pitch-black fruit flavors that show the warmth of the vintage but retain their balance. The tannins provide some pucker."
US,91.0,18.0,Carneros,Waterstone,"This is a floral, zesty and vibrant white wine, given six months in French oak, half of it new. With a complex hit of briny salt and citrus, it flirts between layers of savory and sweet, finding just the right balance of structure and acidity."
US,86.0,29.0,Dry Creek Valley,David Clinton,"From a new, small producer devoted to 100% Zinfandel, this soft, grippy wine offers a hint of menthol on the nose and muted aromatics. The finish is ripe though tempered by good acidity."
France,83.0,33.0,CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Lamothe de Haux,"Soft, ripe and jammy, this is too ripe and misses structure. Its acidity does redeem it, but it is not going to develop much."
Italy,90.0,32.0,Umbria,Lungarotti,Soft layers of Chardonnay with aromas of vanilla cream and stone fruit are blended with fresh notes of citrus and passion fruit from the Vermentino element found within. The two varieties complement each other very well and produce an elegant wine for shellfish or seafood risotto.
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"Though Columbia Crest is widely available, the reserve tier is not. Just a few hundred cases of this reserve were made, done in an oaky, buttered popcorn style. Think California with more acidity."
US,85.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ram,"This is an unusual example of this variety, with aromas of exotic spice, flowers and herb. The palate has tart cranberry flavors that seem lacking in concentration."
US,90.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Buty,"The aromas entice with notes of wet stone, honeysuckle, chamomile and stone fruit. The palate is generous in flavor and feel, showing a fine sense of balance."
US,88.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Terlato,"Fresh aromas of honeysuckle lead to a palate where honey and vanilla come together atop ripe peach. Medium bodied, the texture is unctuous before finishing lean and light."
France,93.0,49.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau la GaffeliÃ¨re,"The second wine of this Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru ClassÃ© estate comes from selected parcels. Rich and with the smoothness of oak aging and ripe grapes, it is a generous wine that is developing well. Drink from 2020."
US,88.0,12.0,California,Ironstone,"Honey is the key word to describe the nose and flavor of this extremely aromatic and just slightly sweet wine, which also offers notes of honeysuckle and honeydew. Winemakers often turn the grape Symphony (a cross of Muscat of Alexandria and Grenache Gris) into a sweet, dessert-style wine, but this shows how good it can be in a drier version."
US,92.0,68.0,Diamond Mountain District,En Garde,"Coconut macaroon and blueberry and blackberry preserves make for a juicy, satisfying mountain-grown wine that sparks in black pepper, before finishing full of fresh acidity and complexity. Light bodied and restrained in oak and tannin, it's ready to enjoy now."
US,87.0,34.0,Sonoma County,Adobe Road,"This is a good Zinfandel with some special qualities. It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices."
US,88.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Lost Canyon,"Bold notions of strawberry and cherry form around a robust core of oak and tannin, giving this rounded, approachable wine a medium to full-figured build. Minty earth follows, an element of herb that's refreshing on the palate and impactful, a sign of its cooler-climate vineyard site."
France,90.0,23.0,Vouvray,Domaine Pichot,"This sparkling wine shows the potential richness that can come from the combination of Chenin Blanc and bubbles. It's a nutty, spicy and ripe wine. At the same time, its acidity and tense structure give a cool crisp feel. This balance and tension are just right and the wine is ready to drink."
France,90.0,26.0,Pouilly-LochÃ©,Cave des Grands Crus Blancs,"With ripe fruits, this generous wine also has a great line of acidity. A touch of vanilla gives extra richness. At the same time, the balance with the fresh lemon flavors and ripe peaches is just right. Drink now."
Spain,88.0,10.0,La Mancha,Paso a Paso,"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more."
Australia,87.0,19.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"A fun, youthful wine. Juicy, chewy fruit on the palate isn't overpowered by lots of oak. Ripe plum and blackberry on the nose; finishes with less verve than the palate has."
Australia,92.0,42.0,Yarra Valley,Giant Steps,"Phil Sexton's wines under the Giant Steps label are becoming more consistent, and the 2014s may be his best yet. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, with a supple, creamy texture and lingering notes of spring flowers and black cherries. Subtle oaking adds brown sugar and mocha shadings to the crisp finish. Drink now??022."
US,92.0,22.0,Alexander Valley,Hobo,"This Zinfandel specialist tries its hand at Cabernet, with excellent results. With modest alcohol, the wine is thoroughly ripe, showing complex flavors of blackberries, crÃ¨me de cassis, herbs and cedar. It will be fascinating to watch this Bordeaux-style wine develop over the years."
US,88.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Sbragia,"The tannins are very hard on this bone-dry Cabernet Sauvignon, which was blended with 5% Cabernet Franc. It's tough to appreciate now, despite a wealthy core of blackberries, cherries and currants. Is it an ager? The best guess is no, it won't age, so drink now and over the next few years."
US,84.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Barefoot Cellars,"Light and delicate, it attracts more for its stylish finesse than for any power or ageability. Berry and earth flavors are framed in modest tannins and soft acids, and there's some bitterness from the middle palate through the finish."
France,86.0,29.0,Sancerre,Henry Natter,"A light orange-colored rosÃ©, it's equally light on the palate. It has lost its freshness while broadening out into a softly fruity, orange peel and strawberry flavored wine. It needs food."
US,87.0,19.0,Finger Lakes,Standing Stone,"Waxy white florals and lifted apple aromas add freshness to slightly cider-like flavors of pressed apple and mulling spice in this dry Riesling. Delicately light bodied it has a brisk, refreshing finish."
US,86.0,16.0,Willamette Valley,Zimri Cellars,"A lightweight effort with admirably low alcohol, this quaffable wine offers apple sauce flavors, hints of toasted almonds, and a touch of lemon oil. It slips comfortably into a Pinot Grigio style rather than the fleshier Pinot Gris more often found in Oregon."
US,91.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Hersly,"This medium-bodied, small-production red was given a light touch of oak, only 25% of it new and French, allowing the other characteristics to speak louder than the wood. Compact tannins support a juicy, youthfully grippy frame of pomegranate and orange that opens further in the glass."
US,90.0,45.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Savannah-Chanelle,"Rugged scents of wild berries and forest woods blend into intriguing aromas on this wine from the highest Pinot Noir vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It unleashes a rainbow of flavors, from acai and red fruit to rum cake and brown spices to mocha, tea, tobacco and Dr. Pepper."
Argentina,90.0,50.0,Mendoza,Andeluna,"Expect a fair amount of forward, creamy oak and you'll be just fine digging into this rich, healthy Malbec (with some Cabernet Franc). Intense blackberry, black cherry and chocolate flavors bring a smile even if they don't seem that complex. But on further thought, this wine is about hedonistic richness, barrel notes and pleasure as opposed to stirring things up intellectually."
US,85.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Lucas Vineyards,"The nose on this red is exotic?allspice, fruitcake, pepper?and on the palate, flavors of cherry and raspberry are likeable, if a little thin. Medium-  bodied tannins and a bright finish give the wine extra points. Pair with a red sauce pasta dish or meat for added enjoyment."
France,89.0,60.0,Champagne,Canard-DuchÃªne,"Named after the King of France who was crowned in Reims cathedral by Joan of Arc in 1429, this cuvÃ©e with its rounded toast and yeast flavors is attractively mature and soft. It has baked-apple flavors and a ripe, perfumed texture. The acidity at the end is gentle and rich."
Italy,93.0,70.0,Barolo,Germano Ettore,"Aromas of baked plum, crushed blue flower, allspice, leather and chopped herb come together on this on young, powerfully built wine. The taut palate delivers black cherry, cinnamon, tobacco, licorice and toast alongside bracing, fine-grained tannins that need to time to come around. Drink 2021??031."
US,86.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"The flavors of sweetened herb tea, pineapple and buttered toast mark this fresh, vibrant young Chardonnay. It's brisk in acidity and dry in the finish. A bit rustic, it's a fine wine to drink now."
France,91.0,24.0,Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine."
France,91.0,56.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,M. Chapoutier,"Chapoutier has fashioned a full-bodied, creamy-textured 2009 Le Bernardine, with dark, plummy fruit and a hint of chocolate liqueur that ably reflect the warm vintage. Yet despite all of the lushness, the wine doesn't come across as heavy or overdone, making it attractive for early drinking. Try now??018."
France,88.0,10.0,Minervois,ChÃ¢teau Cabezac,"There's no shortage of spice in this value Minervois, with strong notes of pepper and garrigue herbs backed by notes of orange rind, red cherry and young raspberry. Medium-light in the mouth with moderate acidity and soft tannins; drink up now."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Sicilia,Valle dell'Acate,"Il Moro is a pure expression of Nero D'Avola with earthy, mineral tones and distant aromas of popcorn and almond nut. It is compact and tight in the mouth with polished tannins on the close."
Italy,90.0,42.0,Cannonau di Sardegna,Tenute Soletta,"There's a glimpse of dried herb and rosemary behind more intense aromas of black fruit, cherry and leather. This rich wine is concentrated and persistent, and it should pair well with stewed meat dishes."
France,92.0,40.0,Bandol,ChÃ¢teau Salettes,"Structured and firm, this is a tight wine with powerful, youthful acidity as well as a dense structure and dark tannins. It has weight as well, indicating a wine with excellent aging potential. Drink from 2016."
Argentina,89.0,17.0,Cafayate,Loscano,Tropical and citrus fruit aromas come with controlled skin-based bitterness. This has a full oily texture and flavors of lemon-lime and white pineapple. Fresh acidity on the finish keeps this clean and in good shape. Drink right away.
Italy,91.0,32.0,Sicilia,Firriato,"Quater is an innovative blend of Nero d'Avola, Perricone, Frappato and Nerello Cappuccio (four important indigenous grapes of Sicily) with a vinous but intense bouquet of red fruit, chocolate and spice. The mouthfeel is soft, velvety and opulent."
France,88.0,35.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Hermitage Saint-Martin,"In Provence, heavy bottle seems to equal high alcohol. It's true here, with a wine that, while it has the right pale grey pink color, is almost too rich for its own good. It does have fruit and acidity but they are just a part of a powerful and ripe wine. Age it until the end of 2014 for best results."
US,89.0,29.0,Willamette Valley,Chehalem,"Pungent and assertively herbal, this blend of Chehalem's three estate vineyards has aromatics to spare, along with an earthy mix of root, stem and brambly fruit. There's a streak of cola also, and it delivers plenty of power for a cool vintage wine that clocks in at 12.7% alcohol."
Italy,90.0,210.0,Toscana,Le Macchiole,"Scrio boasts chunky aromas of clove, milk chocolate, coconut and pulsing blueberry. You can definitely identify the hot vintage in the wine's complex DNA although it isn't a big issue in terms of quality. The mouthfeel is polished and firm and the wine's long finish is amazing."
US,91.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Nadia,"From vineyards in the high-desert Cuyama Valley comes this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 15% Petite Sirah. On the nose, it shows chopped fresh mint, rose blossoms, fennel, black cherries and teriyaki beef jerky. Black pepper and soy mark the palate, along with blackberry juice and a slate-driven minerality."
France,90.0,17.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Gabriel Meffre,"Meffre's Laurus range includes a number of interesting wines, like this CÃ´tes du Rhione white, a blend of 51% Viognier, 29% Roussanne, 14% Grenache Blanc and 4% Bourboulenc. It's perfumed and floral yet full bodied and richly textured, with apricot and ginger notes enhanced by hints of cinnamon and clove from time in barrel. Drink now."
France,90.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Alain Jaume et Fils,"The Grand Veneur white relies on a somewhat unusual blend of Viognier, Roussanne and Clairette to yield a svelte, medium-bodied wine. Delicate aromas of pencil shavings and pear lead into a palate boasting pear, melon and tangerine flavors. There's just enough citrusy zest to prolong the finish. Drink now??020."
US,91.0,45.0,Yakima Valley,Doyenne,"This blend consists of 40% MourvÃ¨dre, 40% Grenache and 20% Syrah, creating a strong base that's loaded with steely mineral and graphite notes, plus tart fruit flavors of cranberry and strawberry. A hint of strawberry leaf brings in an herbal accent."
France,88.0,20.0,Chablis,La Chablisienne,"Soft and rounded, this has apple and peach fruits, with a lemon zest texture. The acidity is a refreshing counterweight to the smooth character."
US,86.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Apolloni,"Modeled after an Italian Pinot Bianco, this tart, citrusy wine sports fresh-cut green apple fruit flavors. It's done in stainless steel, nicely balanced but definitely made to go with spicy Pacific Rim foods."
US,86.0,20.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Villa Toscano,"This bright, citrusy White Barbera has aromas and flavors of lemon, lime and baked bread. Its balance and tropical fruit finish will please a crowd."
US,88.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pomum,"This wine starts out quite reductive, while also showing aromas of black olive, herbs and chocolate. It's full bodied in feel with abundant dark fruit flavors that show persistence. There are good things here but the aromas and flavors seem disconnected."
US,94.0,75.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brave & Maiden,"Only one barrel of this Paul Hobbs-consulted bottling was produced, and that extreme focus made for a powerful and rich though not overripe result. Concentrated blackberry and violet aromas are cut by crushed gravel and cedar spice notes. Leather, tobacco, rose petal and black pepper accents spice up its black fig flavors on the hearty palate, which is structured with fine-grained tannins."
Spain,87.0,14.0,Navarra,Vega Sindoa,"Smells nice as aromas of lemon curd, honeysuckle and lychee fruit make for a very Viognier-like bouquet. But it is indeed Chardonnay, and the palate of lemon, apple and orange is driving and touched up by forward but controlled oak. Lengthy on the back end, with a kiss of butterscotch. Not refined or Burgundian, but good for Navarra."
France,88.0,16.0,Cahors,Lannac Saint-Jean,"While it's firmly tannic, the fruit still shows through the structure. It has taut flavors of black plum and currant; angular now, but has some good aging potential."
Italy,90.0,29.0,Gattinara,Travaglini,"Aromas of mature red berry, dark plum, chopped herb and a balsamic note come together in the glass. The structured mid-weight palate delivers dried cherry, star anise, cinnamon and mineral alongside firm, refined tannins."
France,96.0,64.0,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,"A fragrant and pure nose of slightly floral tangerine peel opens this wine. It offers a ripe fruit-driven dance of aromas and freshness?think tangerine, ripe lemon, crisp apple and a beguiling floral dimension. Lovely now in its primary-flavored youth, it's certain to become even more disarming in the future. Drink 2020??035 or later if you like it really mature."
US,87.0,22.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"Hints of crushed stones lend a mineral focus to this dry, elegantly structured wine. It's piercingly tart on the palate with loads of fresh lime and lemon flavor, but gains richness on the midpalate with streaks of fresh apple and crisp yellow peach. A hint of saffron adds spice to the moderately long finish."
US,90.0,26.0,Long Island,The Grapes of Roth,"Similarly to it's Virgin Berry sibling, Roth's regular label Dry Riesling has a distinctly green, woodsy tone lending an alpine feel to sweet-tart peach and apricot flavors. It's brisk and fine-footed, yet zesty tangerine and grapefruit acidity persist long on the finish."
US,93.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Barden,"There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality."
France,91.0,70.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Capet-Guillier,"Owned by nÃ©gociant firm Antoine Moueix, this property on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, has produced a ripe and balanced vintage in 2014. The oak aging has enhanced the richness of the wine with its balanced tannins and black-currant fruits. It will age well and be ready to drink from 2021."
Italy,84.0,16.0,Casorzo,Ricossa,"This rosÃ© dessert wine has a creamy fizz, with flavors of sweet raspberry and wild berry. Simple and sweet, it is dark raspberry in color."
France,88.0,24.0,Alsace,Gustave Lorentz,"Soft and attractively spicy, this has flavors of fresh apple, exotic mango and kiwi. Along with this fruitiness is a perfumed character that rounds out the finish. Screwcap."
Spain,89.0,30.0,Ribera del Duero,Conde de Siruela,"Unusual but not unpleasant aromas of cinnamon and coffee cake lead to a saturated palate with rugged tannins. Flavors of fig paste, chocolate and baking spices confirm the wine's ripeness, while blackened flavors and rock-hard tannins drive the finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Rasa,"Lees notes take the lead on this unusual wine, followed by aromas of apricot, almond butter and cream. It drinks a hair off dry with a lightly creamy feel."
France,90.0,38.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Ambe Tour Pourret,"Rich, spicy and perfumed, this delicious wine is developing well and also has aging potential. It is packed with berry and plum fruits that parade with acidity and tannins that act as a support. It's still dense and the balanced fruit and tannins will allow it to age. Drink from 2018."
France,88.0,40.0,Pauillac,ChÃ¢teau d'Armailhac,"Soft, juicy and fruity, relatively light in character. The tannins are fresh, supporting black currant and fresh, juicy fruit flavors. It's easy and open, developing well, but quickly."
US,87.0,24.0,Sonoma Coast,William Knuttel,"A nice Pinot Noir, dry and elegant, and if it's somewhat one-dimensional, it packs a lot of flavor. With rich raspberry, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, it's a lovely wine to drink now."
US,87.0,49.0,Willamette Valley,Johan,"As the name indicates, this limited reserve is a selection of the winemaker's best barrels. It was fermented with 90% whole clusters, and aged 15 months in one-third new French oak. There are ample scents and flavors of stem, leaf and root, which dominate. Give this wine a lot of breathing time or a vigorous decant, which will help to bring the fruit back up."
US,92.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality."
France,90.0,39.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"Saint Odile is patron saint of Alsace, with this walled vineyard in Obernai named after her. This complex wine is moving in the direction of sweetness although it still has a nervy, almost mineral character. Textured and young, it needs to develop. Drink from 2016."
US,87.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Convergence Zone,"Light aromas of citrus, white peach, soda water and herbs are followed by elegant, just off-dry, spritzy fruit flavors backed by a zing of acidity."
US,91.0,40.0,Dry Creek Valley,Bella,"This Zin wants two or three years to round off the jagged edges. There's a lot going on, from the supple blackberry, leather and pepper flavors, wildly exotic spices and smooth tannins to an undefinable earthy-mineral taste that must come from the soil. There's some burn from alcohol, as Zins from the Maple Vineyards tend to exhibit."
US,85.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,Stolen Identity,"You'll have to look in the very lower left hand corner of the back label to spot the vintage (2015) on this bottle. It's a light simple wine, with delicate flavors of melon and pear. The finish is soft and has a residual hint of paste."
France,90.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Saint-AndrÃ© de FiguiÃ¨re,"The domaine bottling of Saint-AndrÃ© de FiguiÃ¨re really ratchets up the quality over its nÃ©gociant wines, adding much more weight and concentration. This blend of 50% MourvÃ¨dre, 20% Grenache and 25% Cinsault blends black cherry and citrus flavors into a richly textured, spicy rosÃ©."
US,84.0,11.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"This darkly colored blush may be technically dry, like the label says, but it tastes as sweet as raspberry Kool-Aid. If you like that fruity style, it's for you."
Italy,90.0,16.0,Collio,Gradis'ciutta,"This ripe, juicy wine opens with yellow stone fruit, Spanish broom and faint nut aromas. The medium-bodied palate doles out ripe Golden Delicious apple and mature Bartlett pear flavors, while a pleasant bitter almond note backs up the finish."
US,95.0,44.0,Edna Valley,Claiborne & Churchill,"The nose of this bottling explodes with exotic cherry scents and compelling strokes of iron, rose, carnation and cinnamon. It's refreshingly tart and earthy on the palate, where dewy sage, mint and tarragon touches lift its youthful raspberry and green olive flavors. Easy to guzzle, yet intriguingly complex."
US,90.0,37.0,Napa Valley,Elyse,"Immature now, with sweet, jammy berry fruit, currants and hard tannins, and the oak overlay hasn't been integrated yet. But there's a lot going on in this spicy, bold Zin. Give it 3?? years."
US,92.0,90.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Domaine de la Cote,"Sashi Moorman and Rajat Parr love to pick early, and it shows with aromas of stewed tomatoes, green olives, green cardamom and Eastern European spices. It's very savory and wakes up the palate with vinegar-laden flavors reminiscent of North African tagines, and would make an excellent extra-spice accompaniment to a wide variety of foods. Expect this wine to grow in complexity and approachability 2018??024."
Italy,85.0,43.0,Vino Spumante,Peri Bigogno,Medicinal herb and lime lead the nose and carry over to the lean palate along with bitter walnut and yellow apple skin. It's dominated by brisk acidity.
Italy,89.0,25.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Bisceglia,"Mediterranean herb, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas float out of the glass. On the firm palate, notes of anise and ground pepper accent a core of dried black cherries while aggressive, close-grained tannins grip the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink up."
US,85.0,15.0,California,Scott Harvey,"Black plum, boysenberry and fig flavors fill this soft and generous wine. It has a medium-red color, medium body and very fruity aromas. A relaxed, broad texture makes it easy to drink."
US,90.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,Hersly,"Fermented and aged in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine opens with a reduced, closed nose that expands on the palate into a creamy, luxurious bite of apple and melon. Juicy and complex, it has a balance of weight and length."
Italy,95.0,50.0,Barolo,Renato Ratti,"Wild berry, crushed herb, violet and baking spice scents lift out of the glass along with a whiff of menthol. Focused and elegantly structured, the delicious palate doles out ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon, sage and white pepper, while refined tannins and bright acidity provide supple support and impeccable balance. Drink 2023??033."
US,91.0,25.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,White Hart Wine,"From a vineyard that's 40 years old, this smartly priced bottling shows vanilla, clove, hickory smoke and black cherry on the hearty nose. The palate is soft upon entry, showing more of that clove against a baked black-plum background."
France,85.0,10.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de Lagorce,The wine is all juicy red-currant and berry fruits. With light tannins and a crisp edge the wine is fruity and ready to drink.
France,86.0,25.0,VallÃ©e du Paradis,Val Auclair,"There's a slightly funky edge to this Carignan-Syrah blend, with gamy and herbal streaks to the bright red-berry aromas. The palate is a bit richer, with darker flavors of cherry and blackberry leaf that carry through to the medium-length finish."
Italy,88.0,46.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane,San Lorenzo Vini,"Aromas of mature plum, French oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the way. The full-bodied palate offers vanilla, espresso, coconut, sour cherry and grilled herb alongside assertive close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit."
US,82.0,13.0,Sonoma County,Sebastiani,"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay features buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and buttered toast flavors. Turns cloyingly sweet on the finish."
US,94.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Family,"The winery's '08 bottling of this Pinot was very good, but this is considerably better. It's rich in red cherries and ripe persimmons, with complex notes of grilled beef, cola and sautÃ©ed wild mushrooms, and has a long, spicy finish. A joy to drink now, and it will develop bottle nuances over the next six years."
US,90.0,80.0,Diamond Mountain District,Von Strasser,"Raspberry and cranberry flavors and a twist of cinnamon stick accent the firm tannins of this estate wine, marked by classic red currant, cedar and dried herb notes. Medium-bodied and modest in oak, it shows a clarity of crisp acidity."
Argentina,84.0,20.0,Mendoza,TintoNegro,"Rubbery on first take, with sweet chocolate and carob aromas. Feels pretty thick, with a creamy lead into an herbal-tasting palate that's crowded with oak and milk chocolate flavors. Turns resiny on the finish."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Alto Adige,Castel Sallegg,"Lightly scented with citrus blossom and orchard fruit, this racy white offers up delicate flavors of yellow apple and lemon zest. It's linear, with vibrant acidity that leaves a crisp finish."
US,85.0,24.0,Sonoma,MacMurray Ranch,"Comes down on the brittle side, a dry, acidic Pinot Noir with good structure, but lacks the richness you really want. You'll find modest cherry, cola and vanilla flavors."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Prosecco,Zonin,"Fun and refreshing, this frothy sparkler opens with scents of spring flower and white stone fruit. The lively palate doles out creamy white peach and green apple alongside fresh acidity."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Somontano,Olvena,"Dusty and plump up front, with a hint of melon. The palate is round and easygoing, with moderate acidity supporting baked apple and melon flavors. On the finish it's pithy and slightly bitter, but for the most part it holds onto its form and freshness."
Argentina,86.0,10.0,Mendoza,Sur de los Andes,"Sweet and properly ripe, with just a touch of medicinal mint on the nose. The palate is concentrated and clean, with solid blackberry and plum flavors. Mellow and relatively smooth on the finish. Perfectly appropriate for everyday consumption; 50% Malbec and 50% Cab Sauvignon."
France,88.0,58.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"Dominated by Pinot Meunier, this soft rich wine is immediately accessible. It has apple and crisp pear fruits along with a dry crisp texture. The nonvintage Champagne from this producer is attractive, fruity and dry at the end."
Italy,90.0,18.0,Soave Classico,Gini,"Crisp and linear, this delicious Soave delivers sensations of honeysuckle, tart green apple, creamy white peach and juicy nectarine. It's vibrant and balanced, with bright acidity."
US,86.0,60.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Torii Mor,"This bottling is still a bit disjointed, the acids stick out and the fruit seems confined to a tight corner. The raw materials are good enough?berries and watermelon, a whiff of tomato, moderate tannins and more than a hint of new oak. Give this one another year or two to smooth out the wrinkles."
Spain,88.0,35.0,Rioja,Bodegas Valdemar,"Charred on top and showing roasted berry aromas underneath. This wine sizes up as a plump, round berry ball with low-to-medium acidity and soft tannins. It's just mildly herbal and rooty, with a soft finish. It flows smoothly and won't cause any eyebrows to be raised. Drink now."
France,84.0,25.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Lamothe-Vincent,"With light toast aromas, this is a wine that shows vanilla from wood aging more than its fruitiness. There is a barnyard edge to it that brings out rusticity. On the finish, acidity does bring some freshness."
Australia,86.0,16.0,Margaret River,Cape Mentelle,Classic Semillon aromas of hay and quince create an intriguing but subtle opening act while the simpler palate displays some attractive cut-grass notes from the Sauvignon Blanc. A good partner for flavorful shellfish preparations.
US,87.0,12.0,California,Dancing Bull,"Herbaceous in aroma, this crisp and dry wine tastes fresh and lean?typical for a Sauvignon Blanc. It smells like parsley and thyme, is lemony and medium bodied on the palate, and has a tangy finish."
Argentina,90.0,55.0,Mendoza,Bodega Catena Zapata,"Wild berry, licorice and plum aromas are solid but quiet. This Cabernet is built on leathery, tough tannins and roasted, savory flavors of saucy berry and plum. A spunky, savory tasting finish is tomatoey and leathery, with leftover sauciness. Drink through 2020."
Italy,86.0,18.0,Barbera d'Asti,CarlindePaolo,"This informal red has delicate black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The simple palate suggests black plum and clove, with a touch of tobacco. It's not very intense and already extremely accessible, so drink soon."
US,86.0,11.0,California,Barefoot Bubbly,"What a delicious, easy-to-like bubbly. It's definitely on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, with raspberry jam, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. It will pair nicely with ham sandwiches, fried chicken, fresh fruit."
US,85.0,13.0,Sonoma County,Lyeth,"Here's a big, fruity, jammy Cabernet. It shows ripe, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with polished tannins and a dry, spicy finish."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Rampa di Fugnano,"This bright Vernaccia layers pretty tones of citrus, pear and cut grass over a lean texture and medium body. This is a good choice to pair with seafood or light salads."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Terre Siciliane,Feudo Principi di Butera,"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this bold wine features aromas of spiced plum, blackcurrant, leather and a hint of coconut. On the palate, assertive tannins support the mature blackberry, espresso and licorice flavors."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Campania,Feudi di San Gregorio,"This offers heady aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, blue flower and a whiff of tilled earth. On the soft succulent palate, brown pepper and a hint of saline accent fleshy plum and ripe black cherry. It's smooth and easy drinking, with supple tannins."
Italy,87.0,45.0,Roero,Cascina CÃ  Rossa,"Bone dry and extremely tannic, this Roero Riserva offers interesting notes of wild berries, candied fruit, orange zest and wild flowers. It's tight, firm and sharp on the palate."
Argentina,81.0,14.0,Mendoza,Tercos,"Harsh red-berry aromas are strained. This feels flabby and clumsy, while weedy, medicinal berry flavors do nothing to elevate this shaky, hard-tannin Sangiovese."
Italy,95.0,125.0,Barolo,Giuseppe Rinaldi,"Mature dark berry, cake spice, baked earth, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this impressive wine. The chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside a backbone of firm, ripe tannins and racy acidity. Drink 2019??031."
US,85.0,10.0,Napa Valley,Napa Family Vineyards,"This is a very dry Cab whose blackberry flavors have nuances of green olives and smoky oak. Notable for its balance, it's a nice, inexpensive red wine to have with fancy meals."
France,88.0,16.0,MÃ¢con-Milly Lamartine,Domaine Carrette,"Strong wood aromas show in the toasty edge of this spicy wine. Ripe yellow fruits are full in the mouth, with a crisp, bright aftertaste to give a final lift."
US,90.0,40.0,Yakima Valley,Ardor,"Aromas of black and white pepper and raw meat are redolent on this wine. The palate is all about feel, freshness and texture, without a trace of new wood in sight and a finish that lingers. It's a unique example of the variety that focuses on subtlety and nuance."
France,88.0,25.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Plaisance,"A wine that is, unusually for Bordeaux, dominated by SÃ©millon. That gives a creamy, ripe and still muted character and demands another few years aging. The acidity and fresh citrus fruits are filled out with melon and ripe pear flavors. Drink this wine from 2016."
Italy,95.0,59.0,Barbaresco,Rizzi,"Underbrush, truffle, ripe red berry, violet and pipe tobacco aromas emerge on this beautiful, structured red. The delicious, full-bodied palate shows ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, star anise, ground pepper and clove framed in ripe, velvety tannins. A generous, gorgeous wine."
US,90.0,44.0,Napa Valley,Cuvaison,"Honeyed apple crisp and salty pretzel pave the way for a complex, compelling wine, the acidity high and the floral apple blossom and nutmeg intriguing. The middle shows a youthful tease of impermanence before finishing strong."
US,91.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sequel,"This hedonistic wine has aromas of embers, dark coffee, earth, cranberry and blackberry. It coats the palate with supple, concentrated dark fruit flavors showing some heft and grip to the tannins."
Argentina,90.0,50.0,Mendoza,Ruca Malen,"Initially this smells like bell pepper and green bean more than ripe berry fruits, but with time in the glass it rounds into spicy, herbal form. A tight, reedy palate is bolstered by tomatoey acidity, while flavors of herbal raspberry and red currant finish with ripped tannins and plenty of residual acidity. Drink through 2024."
US,89.0,36.0,Mendocino,City Winery of New York,"A stalwart, sturdy rendering, this smells like ripe plums and dark spices. It tastes full of fruit but is shaded nicely by slightly smoky, peppery notes. The body is full and the texture firm with tannins and acidity. Best drink this after 2018."
US,87.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Magnificent Wine Company,"Except for a splash of Syrah, this qualifies as a Cabernet-centric Bordeaux-style blend. Hard to find a better bottle of blended red wine at the price. This has grip and breed, with tart red fruits, ripe tannins, a wash of herb and tart acidity. Put it up against anything you grill."
US,89.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Glenora,"Whiffs of honey and caramel entice on this elegant late-disgorged sparkler. A blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's delicately pÃ©tillant, filling the palate with soft, supple mousse and whispers of biscuit, citrus rind and berry."
US,86.0,38.0,Alexander Valley,Stuhlmuller Vineyards,"Everything tastes interventionist on this Chardonnay. The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness. Will satisfy fans of the New World style, but the wine, tasty as it is, lacks authenticity and balance."
US,87.0,18.0,Napa Valley,Mumm CuvÃ©e Napa,"Nicely balanced with a blend of toasty-yeasty and fresh elements on the nose, this sparkler has good fruit?not too sweet?and a smooth and creamy feel. Straightforward, it offers full but dry apple-pineapple flavors and some green-apple and lime notes on the finish."
France,88.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau de Marsan,"This wine is tight, crisp with citrus flavors and intense acidity. It is developing into a refreshing, broader wine that will have a riper character. Wait until late 2017."
Spain,90.0,20.0,Rioja,Campo Viejo,"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light."
US,88.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Nuthatch Cellars,"Phinny Hill is in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA of Washington, a prestigious location near Champoux and other high end growers. This CarmenÃ¨re has 5% Syrah added, but the varietal character dominates, with strong green leaf and herb flavors. The tannins are woody and the fruit fragrant with blackberry and cassis. Good varietal expression is the hallmark of this wine."
Italy,84.0,33.0,Barbaresco,La Bioca,"French oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean aromas dominate the nose. The bracing palate offers oak extract, raw cherry, sour cranberry, a green note of powdered sage and oak-driven spice. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an extremely astringent finish and dry out the tongue."
US,90.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Rutherford Hill,"Juicy black fruit shines in this full-bodied wine with structured tannins. Weighty and concentrated, with light dustings of black pepper and cinnamon, its oak is supportive and seasoned in a touch of vanilla."
US,81.0,42.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Fenestra's blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot is aromatically interesting with hints of Dr. Pepper and spice. The palate devolves with strong herbal aromas and light fruit flavors before finishing slightly high in alcohol."
US,88.0,24.0,Edna Valley,Baker & Brain,"This is a brilliant wine that showcases Edna Valley's ability to produce some of the purest white-wine flavors in California. If there's any oak, it's not apparent at all. What you get are crisp, clean flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, peaches, vanilla, white pepper and herbs."
US,88.0,13.0,Oregon,Firesteed,"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now."
Argentina,84.0,16.0,Mendoza,Andean,"Cool, dark-plum aromas are mildly herbal. This feels drawn-in and tough. Disposable berry flavors come with peppery notes, while the finish doesn't offer much new."
France,87.0,40.0,Champagne,A. D. Coutelas,"With its lively mousse, this is a perfumed, ripe wine. Warm apricot and green apple flavors are rounded out with a balanced dosage, making for a soft, full wine that is ready to drink."
Italy,87.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Agostina Pieri,"Agostina Pieri opens with notes of old leather and animal tones that eventually blow off to reveal cured ham and smoked bacon. This is a big, broad expression of Sangiovese with tart cherry flavors and slightly astringent tannins. You might want to give it a few more years of aging to mellow out but whether the aromas will hold over time is uncertain."
US,85.0,70.0,Sonoma County,Kenwood,"What a disappointment. This isn't the Artist Series it used to be. It's okay for an everyday Cab, but is simple, with watered-down blackberry and cherry jam flavors. Not ageable, so drink up."
France,91.0,35.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"This is the top cuvÃ©e produced from the Fournier's Pouilly-FumÃ© vines. It is rich while crisp, showing fine acidity and a mineral texture. The green fruits cut through the zesty texture of the wine giving concentration and depth of flavor. Drink this serious wine now."
France,87.0,33.0,Alsace,Maurice Schoech & Fils,"Earthiness mingles with peach-jam richness and frames a medium-sweet, soft and rich palate that shows honeyed, rounded edges of richness."
Argentina,83.0,13.0,Mendoza,Mapema,"Tropical on the nose, with floral, lychee aromas that seem more like TorrontÃ©s than typical Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, the feel is basic, with sweet flavors of lychee, mango and melon. Vacuous on the finish, but overall it's not going to turn anyone off."
US,87.0,30.0,Mendocino,Parducci,"This is a dark, intensely astringent wine with so much grape and oak tannin that it's challenging to enjoy now. Since PV is known as a grape that provides color and tannin in Bordeaux wines, it's no wonder that it's so stiff today. It will drink best after 2020."
US,90.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Clos La Chance,"A pleasant aromatic mix of sweet buttercream with salted caramel join with pineapple and guava on this wine from the hills above Silicon Valley. It is nicely rounded on the palate, with pear, apple and more guava leading to a yeasty, acidic finish."
US,85.0,24.0,Sonoma County,Simi,"A soft, mid-range, medium-bodied Pinot Noir from areas including the Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast, it imparts aromas of rosemary and herbes de Provence before delving into a world of tart cherry and cranberry. The finish is smoky."
US,91.0,28.0,Napa Valley,B Side,"This wine over-delivers in quality for the price. It's made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blended in to good effect. The whole combines into layers of chocolate and graham cracker, dappled in vanilla and jam. Thick tannins suggest a swirl or two of the glass. The finish is all tobacco."
US,85.0,20.0,New York,Hosmer,"Made from native Cayuga grapes, this softly pÃ©tillant sparkler is pleasantly frothy, and features brisk, lemony acidity. Just a shade sweeter than brut, it's fruity and forward, with ample stone-fruit and blossom notes. Finishes with a dainty lacing of sugar. Drink now."
Spain,88.0,17.0,Rioja,Heredad Ugarte,"Earthy berry, tomato, vanilla, herb and spice notes are textbook Rioja. This is drawing but sturdy in feel, with a mix of dry oak, tomato, plum and currant flavors. A salty tasting, tangy finish is in good shape."
US,83.0,11.0,Arizona,Arizona Angel,"Nutty and pomaceous on the nose, this blend of Riesling, Grenache Blanc and GewÃ¼rztraminer has a slightly sweet, slinky palate that makes it easy to imbibe."
France,85.0,22.0,Petit Chablis,Pascal Bouchard,"Petit Chablis comes from the plateau above the main Chablis vineyards. As here, it offers a light fruity style with only the lightest minerality and much more in the way of apple and citrus flavors. Drink the wine from early 2017."
US,88.0,14.0,Lodi,Josh Cellars,"This soft, easy-drinking wine smells spicy, almost like tobacco, and tastes plummy and pruney. It has a good, smooth texture and lingering finish."
US,90.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Pedroncelli,"This is a very dry, silky Pinot Noir made in a more restrained manner than some of the big, huge ones out there. It doesn't whack your head, but appeals for its elegance. Shows sophisticated cherry, sassafras and sandalwood flavors, and the price is extremely good for the quality."
US,80.0,28.0,Rogue Valley,Del Rio,"Light, almost ephemeral, this pale Pinot does not give you much to hold on to. The fruit is thin to the point of invisible, tasting of watermelon and little else. Thin, watery and plain."
US,93.0,36.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Longoria,"One of the best California Tempranillos of this or any vintage, Longoria's '07 establishes a new benchmark for the variety. Finally we have a dry, crisp and complex Tempranillo, filled with cherry, red currant, tobacco, spice, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into polished tannins. A delicious, medium-bodied red wine to enjoy with lamb chops, game, or even roast salmon."
US,87.0,40.0,Santa Barbara County,Epiphany,"This blend of Syrah and Grenache bears ripe, forward flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, dried currant, anise and cedar. The tannins are massive, but ripe and sweet, and there is a green note that gives the wine some bitterness."
Spain,88.0,10.0,Cava,CastellvÃ­ de la Marca,"This smells toasted and heady, with a baked apple aroma. The mouthfeel is full, while the flavors tend toward citrus and pith. Solid on the finish."
US,86.0,12.0,Washington,14 Hands,"Butter, pear and baking spice aromas are followed by a rounded palate with sweet fruit flavors. Pair it with baked chicken."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Corteforte,"Having endured up to 8 months of oak aging, this offers modern touches of chocolate, spice and espresso bean that sit behind fresh aromas of black cherry and plum. The medium finish shows depth and length."
US,88.0,27.0,Yakima Valley,Ott & Murphy,"A blend of Marsanne and Grenache Blanc, with a dribble of Roussanne, this offers fruit that falls on the cool side of tropical. It has fine balance and length."
US,95.0,65.0,Dundee Hills,Domaine Drouhin Oregon,"This reserve-level cuvÃ©e has been made since 2004, but in severely limited amounts. A mix of one-third new, one-third once-used and one-third neutral oak barrels aged the blend. Rich, tight and sappy, it shows generous ripe stone and tropical fruits, along with rich layers of butterscotch and toast. Drink now through 2025."
US,84.0,24.0,Central Coast,Vino Vargas,"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge."
US,92.0,80.0,Livermore Valley,Nottingham Cellars,"This impressive wine combines power and style. It has a classic Bordeaux-like aroma that's subtly spicy, very clean, complex and precise. Then loads of red and black fruit flavors come out, seeming almost sweet for a moment until those firm tannins and lively acidity kick in to add a textural grip. The finish lingers, with light spicy oak notes that fade slowly. Best now through 2020."
US,85.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Slightly confected floral notes are ruffled with green herbs and leaves on this off-dry Muskat Ottonel. The palate is peachy and a bit  perfumey, but refreshingly brisk with acidity."
US,91.0,30.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"Pretty aromas of fresh-picked raspberries and cherries invite you into this lovely young Pinot. It's fresh as a spring day, with perfect balance and clarity. Drink now through 2018??020."
France,86.0,19.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Domaine des Deux Roches,"Crisp and lively, this is a tight and mineral wine. Baked-apple fruitiness is balanced by bright acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
US,86.0,15.0,Atlas Peak,Cameron Hughes,"Plenty of crisp acidity balances the citrus, tropical fruit and pear flavors in this ripe Chardonnay. There's also a strong jacket of smoky oak with its buttered toast and vanilla richness. The result will please Chard lovers at a good price."
France,94.0,80.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Alex Gambal,"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness. Textured and tight, it has hints of yellow fruit in the background that will blossom as the wine develops. Drink from 2021."
US,84.0,40.0,Spring Mountain District,Terra Valentine,"There's a vegetable aroma in this wine, not exactly herbs, more like asparagus. In the mouth, the Cab tastes soft, sweet and candied. Average at best, and not an ager."
US,84.0,28.0,Napa Valley,SuncÃ© Vineyard & Winery,"Light in the mouth and silky, like a Pinot Noir, with cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. A little one-dimensional, but okay now with a nice cheeseburger."
Italy,87.0,325.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Argiano,"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish."
US,91.0,17.0,Edna Valley,Tangent,"Made with no oak, this pretty wine stars fresh fruit and clean acidity. With orange, honeysuckle, melon, mineral and vanilla flavors, it has a mouthfeel midway between a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and a creamy Chardonnay. Production was low, only 559 cases, but worth a search."
Italy,84.0,16.0,Chianti Classico,Natale Verga,"Subdued aromas recall blue flower and berries, but overall the nose isn't very expressive. The one-dimensional palate offers red cherry but it's lean and short on freshness. This is starting to fade so drink now."
France,84.0,12.0,Lot,Georges Vigouroux,"Full bodied and rich, this has flavors of spice, red plum and caramel. It's quite heavy and dense, so drink it with food."
US,93.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Trombetta,"Silky in texture, with a tannic bite, this lovely wine is spicy in cinnamon and clove, buoyed by ripe plum and wild strawberry. Medium in weight, it's complex and measured, balanced by a leathery, smooth finish and lively acidity."
US,87.0,15.0,Dunnigan Hills,Matchbook,"A great value Chardonnay, full of big green apple flavor, that's well-made and not overly complicated. With some texture and just enough heft, have it mid-week with lemony chicken."
France,91.0,40.0,Chablis,ChÃ¢teau de Maligny,"Round and rich, this has streaks of lemon and orange zest that cut through the vanilla and creamed apple texture. A note of spice makes the wine complex and rich. This is worth aging for several years."
US,90.0,19.0,Willamette Valley,Apolloni,"This reserve-level effort is crisp and stylish. Fruit flavors mix melon, lime and pink grapefruit, nicely balanced against fresh, textural acids. About 20% of the blend was aged briefly in acacia."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Toscana,Fattoria San Felo,"A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of red currant, cooking spice and a lightly toasted note. The sleek, easy palate doles juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and mocha alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy soon."
France,87.0,15.0,Morgon,Vignerons de Bel Air,"This is a structured wine whose fruit is still coming through the tannins. It has a dry core, layers of acidity and juicy bitter cherry acidity. Drink from the end of 2016."
France,93.0,120.0,Champagne,Baron-FuentÃ©,"This is Baron-FuentÃ©'s top wine, made as an expression of pure Chardonnay. It is tight, textured and ready for some bottle aging. The minerality is palpable with its zingy edge and lemon-zest flavors. While the wine can be drunk now, it will be much more complex in a few months. Drink from 2017."
US,93.0,48.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Mount Eden Vineyards,"Mount Eden's estate Chardonnay typically starts out life as a tight, nervous wine. It's marked by acidity and minerals, and you don't want to drink it too cold. The '04 is a lovely young wine, rich and dramatically complex, with layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, wet stone, creamy yeast and smoky oak, like an important Chablis. Brilliant now, it should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years."
US,90.0,21.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Ross Andrew,"Most of the fruit for this wine comes from this vineyard's 1975 plantings. It brings nuanced aromas of pear and mineral, drinking just a hair off dry, with more than ample acidity to balance out the fleshy flavors. The finish lasts a long time."
US,87.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Ferrari-Carano,"The winery did a nice job with this high production (19,000 cases) Merlot, which was assembled from various parts of the county. The wine is dry and spicy, with scoury tannins that frame cherry, tobacco, thyme and dill flavors. Drink now."
US,86.0,38.0,Mendocino Ridge,Woodenhead,"Unfined and unfiltered, this has a deep garnet color with a little smoky touch at the rim. The aromas resemble ripe cherries and cola, the flavors emphasize both fruit and savory components like sage and smoke and the feel is nicely dry. The way it holds back a bit on richness is fine for a change."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Vermentino di Sardegna,Pala,"This refreshing wine is redolent of stone fruit, citrus and tangerine skin. It's an easy, food-friendly effort."
US,89.0,13.0,Mendocino County,Parducci,"Dry, well-balanced and not heavy-handed, this medium-bodied wine has a firm, lightly grippy texture and tasty fruit flavors. Cinnamon and nutmeg accents meld with just-ripe black cherry and black plum on the palate and echo into the finish."
Australia,90.0,69.0,Barossa,Langmeil,"At first, this wine seems fruity and direct, loaded with dark berry fruit. But over time, it develops more and more oak character, adding notes of cedar, vanilla and mint. It's creamy in texture, with silky tannins, but remains a bit woody on the finish."
US,87.0,100.0,Yountville,Ghost Block,"Sweet in blackberry, blueberry marmalade and cassis flavors, this has notable acidity that provides a scouring mouthfeel. It's a bit rustic now, especially with its jagged tannins, but the finish is dry and long. Sometimes these wines mellow and age well, but this one doesn't seem destined to benefit from cellaring."
Italy,93.0,65.0,Barolo,Sordo,"Aromas of underbrush, rose petal, dark berry, baked earth and game lead the way. The firm, fresh palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and licorice while assertive but refined tannins add a solid grip to the finish."
France,90.0,60.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Nicolas Potel,"This wine comes from one of the best vineyard sites in Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune, on the slope closest to Beaune. It is a smooth, perfumed and ripe wine that has a balanced structure under the bright red-cherry flavor. Still bursting with young fruit, the wine will age, so wait to drink until 2019."
France,87.0,24.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Hourbanon,"Produced from 40-year-old vines with Merlot dominant in the blend, this is a dark wine showing tight black-currant fruits and crisp acidity. With its texture and dry tannins still prominent in its youth, the wine needs to age so drink from 2018."
Italy,87.0,29.0,Recioto di Soave Classico,Cantina del Castello,"Muted aromas of toasted almond, caramel and toasted almond carry over to the palate along with a note of honey. It's structured but also rather evolved without much fruit richness remaining."
France,83.0,26.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau du Cartillon,"This wine is all structure and dark, dry tannins. The fruit is very subdued, giving a hard wine that could well remain tough."
France,88.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Fabre en Provence,This wine comes from one of CÃ´tes de Provence historic cru classÃ© estates. It is a ripe and smooth wine with crisp acidity and a fine bite of spice. The wine is packed with red fruits and finished with refreshing acidity.
US,87.0,27.0,Willamette Valley,Twill,"Ripe apple and banana flavors lead this native yeast-fermented, oak-aged wine. Its loose-knit mix of fruit seems on the cusp of oxidation and is countered with tart, lemony acidity."
France,88.0,35.0,Champagne,Eric Taillet,Equal proportions of the three main Champagne grapes give this wine a fine balance. It is ripe with pear and melon fruitiness as well as almonds and toast that suggest some bottle age. Drink now.
US,93.0,51.0,Russian River Valley,Papapietro Perry,"Light, clear and crisp, this is a soft, silky wine from several vineyard sources within the appellation, robust and rustic on the finish. Along the way, it exudes exotic hits of dark cherry, cola and vanilla, finding balance among the fruit and lively acidity, providing body without too much heat."
US,92.0,38.0,Rockpile,Seghesio,"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but that's part of its charm. Without such ripeness, the wine wouldn't have the briary berry, sweet dried currant and leathery flavors. New oak, to the tune of 25%, adds an even richer layer of char. Quite an accomplishment. Drink with barbecue or big, hearty beef dishes."
Argentina,92.0,58.0,Mendoza,Durigutti,"Ripe, toasty, smoky aromas of blackberry, cassis, licorice and prune are gritty. This is big, tannic and blocky, with tartaric scrape. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, raw oak, licorice and spice finish with notes of toast, chocolate and baking spices. Drink this full-bodied, jammy blend of Malbec and four other red grapes through 2020."
US,92.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Lone Madrone,"A creative, dry-farmed blend of 47% Grenache, 40% Petite Sirah and 13% Zinfandel, this bottling shows dense sagebrush, cedar, sandalwood, pine and black gravel on the dark, shrubby nose. The palate offers olallieberries with a woody twist of dried rosemary and oregano, as well as dried orange-rind tartness."
Argentina,86.0,12.0,Tupungato,Zorzal,"This copper-tinted rosÃ© of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish."
US,90.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Rally Point Wines,A trove of wild strawberry wraps around a concentration of full-bodied smoothness in this deep and brooding wine marked by a juicy core and plenty of length on the finish.
US,90.0,25.0,Central Coast,Bridlewood,"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a CÃ´te RÃ´tie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care."
Italy,89.0,32.0,Etna,Emmi Veruccia,"A blend of 70% Carricante, 15%, Catarratto and 15% Grillo this offers aromas of dried Spanish broom, candied lemon peel and a hint of butterscotch. The ripe palate offers mature apple, candied ginger and mineral, with a note of bitter almond on the close. Made without added sulfites."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Venezie,Lechthaler,"Recalling the zesty style from New Zealand, it offers aromas of cantaloupe and crushed tomato vine along with exotic fruit that all carry over to the palate. It has a crisp, refreshing finish."
US,88.0,16.0,Alta Mesa,Lee Family Farm,"The wine smells rich and opulent, like rose petals and bay leaves in a flood of blackberry jam, but tastes balanced and dry. It's an unusual table wine and a fun journey to take."
US,86.0,22.0,Virginia,Paradise Springs,"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are slightly brambly and peppery on the nose. The medium-bodied palate is driven by mulberry and stone-fruit flavors, yet balanced by just enough citrus verve."
US,94.0,44.0,Yakima Valley,Efeste,"This exuberant wine has aromas of raspberry jam, thyme, orange peel, earth, iron and olive. It's rich and intensely flavorful, with waves of mouthwatering fruit and savory notes that lead to an extended finish."
US,92.0,75.0,Stags Leap District,Stags' Leap Winery,"An estate-grown blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petite Sirah and 10% Merlot, aged entirely in French oak, half of it new, this is a delight of a wine, surprisingly light on its feet despite the vintage and the varieties. Blackberry, cassis and tar wrap around dusty tannins that soften in the glass, teasing on the finish with an expression of fresh flowers."
US,88.0,18.0,Paso Robles,EOS,"Sweet strawberry and red-melon fruits show on the nose of this bottling along with clove, star anise and a touch of herbs. The boysenberry flavors on the sip are laid across fine-grained tannins and a decent acidity."
France,86.0,10.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Alain Brumont,"Half Merlot and half Tannat, this is a wine to drink young for its fruitiness. Blackberry flavors dominate over the gentle tannins and intense succulent acidity. The wine is ready to drink now."
Spain,85.0,10.0,CariÃ±ena,Beso de Vino,"Basic plum and black cherry aromas come with hints of baking spices and cinnamon. This feels a bit high in acidity and pinchy. While a quick wash of grapy, black-fruit flavors finishes without much noise."
US,90.0,35.0,Calaveras County,Twisted Oak,"You want black pepper? You'll get plenty of it in this dry, interesting RhÃ´ne blend of MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah. It has briary flavors of wild blackberries, with an edge of leather, tobacco and herbs, and is thoroughly dry. Pretty tannic, too. An interesting wine, and one to watch."
US,85.0,27.0,Middleburg,Three Fox,"Light garnet in color, this Tuscan-charmer shows notes of charred raspberry, violet and smoked meat on the nose. The light-bodied palate of tart red berries is carried along by driving acidity, with dried herb notes accenting a short finish."
US,89.0,18.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lincourt,"Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine."
US,96.0,55.0,Sonoma Coast,Marimar Estate,"The perfume on this Pinot Noir is so gorgeous, you're tempted to just smell it. It gives off waves of raspberry Newton cookie, fig, orange zest and vanilla bean, and the flavors are even richer. So much power in such a delicately structured wine, it's a real achievement. The garnet color is as translucent as glass, the acidity is perfect and the alcohol gives the wine body and weight without being hot or heavy. As good as it is now, it will also cellar well; drink now??018."
US,84.0,11.0,Central Coast,Concannon,"Sweet and candied, with lemon, lime, pineapple, fig and vanilla flavors. Crisp coastal acidity helps provide a savory, cleansing quality."
US,87.0,20.0,El Dorado,Lava Cap,"A very easy wine to like. It's so softly balanced, so rich in cherries, licorice and smoky vanilla, so light in texture, you could drink it as a cocktail wine. But it will also nicely complement a wide variety of foods."
France,87.0,59.0,Champagne,Tendil & Lombardi,"In this crisp, fresh, very dry rosÃ© Champagne, the red fruits are laced with acidity and apple. A touch of bitterness suggests the wine needs to age a few months in bottle, to soften and get a more generous feel."
Spain,84.0,14.0,Terra Alta,Covilalba,"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one."
Italy,88.0,26.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Arduini,"This would pair perfectly with the sweet and savory qualities of a dish like Roman saltimbocca?veal scallops wrapped with prosciutto and sage. Black cherry, cassis, dark spice and tobacco flavors all play a part in the wine's appeal."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Alto Adige Valle Isarco,Cantina Valle Isarco,This zesty wine opens with aromas of peach and exotic fruit with a whiff of mineral. The palate offers sweet tropical fruit and nectarine with a hint of spice alongside racy acidity.
US,94.0,85.0,Chehalem Mountains,Alloro,"This bottling, limited to just 25 cases, comes out scented with oaky toast, cherry pipe tobacco and baking spices. Flavors of spiced cranberries, strawberry preserves and cherry compÃ´te carry it along into a finish streaked with vanilla. It's big without any awkwardness, and should be consumed now through 2020."
Italy,86.0,30.0,Toscana,Tolaini,"Made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this has a shy nose, eventually revealing whiffs of black-skinned fruit and scorched earth. The subdued rather evolved palate suggests dried black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside mellow tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining freshness."
US,87.0,30.0,Southern Oregon,Season,"Blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this medium-weight effort carries scents of tomato leaf and Mediterranean herbs. Those highlights continue into the palate, with pomegranate fruit and a dry pleasant lightly herbal character."
US,92.0,45.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Gramercy,"A very firm and well-structured expression of pure Walla Walla Syrah. There is a core of blueberry and blackberry fruit, amply wrapped in sweetly toasty, smoky oak (despite very little new barrel usage). It finishes clean with the characteristic earthy foundation of Walla Walla Syrah, and a streak of rock and licorice."
US,96.0,450.0,Sonoma County,VeritÃ©,"The blend is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties added for complexity. The grapes were sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, and the finished wine was aged in 75% new oak. It's very fine, with concentrated, intense blackberry, cherry and crÃ¨me de cassis flavors.Minerality, in the form of granite, lends a lick of stone. It's still extremely tannic, and needs much more timebefore it begins to come around."
US,86.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"Despite its special designation, this is a dilute wine with thin fruit flavors. The core of green apple is accented with a hint of barrel toast (17 months in French oak, 29% new). The acidity seems muted. Drink up."
US,85.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Pope Valley Winery,"This Merlot is dry, firm in tannins and earthy, with cherry, currant and tobacco flavors that finish in a swirl of spice. There's a rusticity to the tannins that strongly suggests drinking now."
US,90.0,34.0,Sonoma Coast,Gundlach Bundschu,"Ripe fruit and new oak combine for lush, complex flavors in this dramatic young Pinot Noir. It shows real flair in the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, with vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast from aging in French barrels. Easy to like now for its silky texture and long, pure spicy finish."
US,84.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mellisoni,Apple and pear aromas are followed by lightly sweet rounded fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal but the sugar seems out of place.
US,85.0,12.0,California,Trinchero,"A grassy style, with hints of fig and melon around the edges. Bright and lemony on the finish. ?J.M."
France,90.0,25.0,Alsace,Domaine GÃ©rard Neumeyer,"A gentle hint of restrained citrus freshness appears on the nose. The same restrained but wonderfully pure citrus flavor also characterizes the slender, light and dry palate: it's a mix of fresh lemon and aromatic, tangy tangerine peel. This enlivens and refreshes and has a totally uplifting lemony finish."
US,92.0,45.0,Chalk Hill,Chalk Hill,"Fresh and vibrantly floral on the nose and palate, this lovely white from the musquÃ© clone imparts full-bodied, voluptuous layers of pineapple and grapefruit rind, lingering long on the finish."
France,87.0,49.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Louis Latour,"This is soft, full of ripe white fruit flavors. The wine is broad, showing some freshness along with the forward richness. It is likely to age relatively quickly."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Sicilia,Calatrasi,"Terrale Oro is a perfect pasta or pizza wine to drink on nights at home with family and friends. It delivers bright red fruit, blackberry and almond paste."
France,85.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Pierrail,"This wine is tight and young. It will have crisp citrus acidity as it matures, giving a bright, lively wine, refreshing to drink and just right for food."
Italy,87.0,9.0,Sicilia,Feudo Arancio,"Feudo Arancio consistently delivers Best Buy value wines and this dense Cabernet Sauvignon is no exception. Aromas include big berry fruit, cherry, spice, mineral and dried herbs. It has good complexity overall with a gritty, raw texture."
US,84.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ryan Patrick,"Thin and tight, this high-acid Syrah is stubbornly closed. It's difficult to predict when?or if?it will open up. Right now, it doesn't show much beyond acid and stem."
US,92.0,55.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Big Basin,"From the Alban ?Powerblock??clone, this estate bottling shows elegant if still somewhat restrained aromas of black currant and violet on the nose. The palate is extremely well integrated and seamless, with dense black fruits lifted by kicks of purple flowers. Quite beautiful but nothing too flashy in any one direction."
US,94.0,45.0,Dry Creek Valley,Gary Farrell,"This gorgeous Zinfandel comes from a vineyard on Bradford Mountain at 1,000 feet elevation, with the vines planted in red, volcanic soils. The palate explodes in juicy plum flavor, with a silky, velvety texture and satisfying cinnamon and pepper spice that plays off the fruit. It's a structured and fresh selection."
Italy,92.0,45.0,Barbaresco,Castello di Verduno,"Hailing from the celebrated RabajÃ  Cru, this offers plump fullness and beautiful aromatic intensity, with notes of black cherry, leather and a touch of chocolate powder. The tannins are solid and fine."
US,91.0,32.0,Red Hills Lake County,Sol Rouge,"This excellent, medium-bodied wine matured in neutral oak barrels is the third of three straight outstanding vintages. It leads with earthy, smoky complexity rather than simple fruit. It smells meaty and peppery and carries those savory notes into its spicy black plum flavors."
Australia,87.0,35.0,Margaret River,Juniper,"Full-bodied, soft and a bit woody, this wine's smoky, hickory-scented aromas end up slightly dominating the fruit flavors. After 20 months in French oak, the fruit has taken on a dried character, ending on a cedary note. Drink now.  Imported by Tom Eddy Wines."
US,93.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Chateau St. Jean,"Run, don't walk, to find this rich Merlot. It shows vast berry, currant, mocha, licorice and cola flavors, wrapped into superfine tannins and balanced with fine acidity. Easy to find, with 7,600 cases produced."
US,93.0,55.0,Alexander Valley,Kendall-Jackson,"One of the riper of the Highland Estate's current crop of Cabernets, the Hawkeye Mountain shows intense varietal character. It's rich in black currants and cedar, with a tangy minerality and firm but pliant tannins. A beautiful Cabernet, at its best now and through 2015."
France,88.0,19.0,Quincy,Jean-Claude Roux,"This is a soft wine, full of ripe apple and white currant fruit flavors. It's fresh , but also has a steely edge that gives a strong texture. Produced from chalk and clay soils, it is tight, rich and needs a few months more in bottle. Drink from 2017."
France,90.0,90.0,CÃ´te RÃ´tie,Jean-Luc Colombo,"Full-bodied and richly textured, this isn't a prototypically delicate CÃ´te RÃ´tie, but it's still very enjoyable. Clove and black olive notes are backed by plummy fruit, capped off by a long, dusty finish. Drink now??025."
US,93.0,54.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Loring Wine Company,"Deep, rich aromas of baked plum, rhubarb pie, star anise, red cinnamon, forest floor and gingerbread show on this nose of this wine from a vineyard planted by the two Garys, Pisoni and Franscioni. The palate is full of baked raspberry and cinnamon-and-clove-spiced cookies, remaining elegant and layered throughout the sip."
US,86.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,L'Oliveto,"A blend from two sites?one in the Sebastopol Hills and the other in the heart of the appellation?this is a high-toned expression of earthiness over fruit, brimming in cardamom and mushroom scents."
US,82.0,11.0,California,Sobon Estate,"Ripe with cherry-berry juiciness, this is a value-priced Zin that's straightforward all around, with a bitter taste to the finish."
Argentina,82.0,15.0,Mendoza,Bodega Cuarto Dominio,"Gold in color, with oxidized aromas of straw, almond skins, butterscotch and baked apple, this PG is fading fast. Flavors of apple and briny stone fruits finish with almondy notes and bitterness."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Prunotto,"This savory wine offers red-skinned berry and baking spice aromas while the palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove and a hint of white pepper. Supple tannins provide support. Enjoy soon."
US,90.0,45.0,Green Valley,Tessier Winery,"Crunchy red fruit is front and center in this vineyard-designate, well capturing the tone of the appellation. Raspberry, black tea and brooding tannins surround a light-bodied frame further highlighted with violet and cardamom."
US,91.0,65.0,Knights Valley,Knights Bridge,"Entirely fermented in French oak before an additional 18 months spent aging also in oak, this wine offers an intoxicating floral entry of apple blossom and lime. Creamy and velvety in texture, its taste profile ranges from spicy nutmeg and apple pie to clarified butter."
US,86.0,12.0,California,Guenoc,"This straightforward, affordable dry wine is good and fruity, with medium body, moderate tannins and plenty of red cherry and blackberry flavors."
US,84.0,23.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Storrs,"Call this wine rustic for its berry and cherry flavors that are so ripe, they veer into raisins. It's almost like a minor Port, with an inky black color and an overtly sweet, milk chocolate finish."
Italy,86.0,22.0,Sicilia,Maurigi,"Saia Grande is a blend of Merlot, Syrah and Pinot Noir that offers plump fruit flavors of cherry and wild berry followed by toasted almond and crushed white pepper."
US,90.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,St. Francis,"Tar and black fruit loll on the full-bodied palate here, the wine well composed to highlight dark, leathery cigar and a hint of cedar. Smooth and round on the finish, it's a varietal rarity for the appellation."
Spain,92.0,52.0,Bierzo,Pittacum,"Poised and focused MencÃ­a with lush, bold aromas that are powerful and alluring. The palate is healthy and stout, with tannic grip that props up black fruit, toast and charcoal flavors. Black pepper, spice and licorice are the finishing notes."
Italy,88.0,26.0,Maremma Toscana,Podere San Cristoforo,"Aromas of blue flower, red berry, baking spice and toasted oak lead the nose. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry and a hint of cinnamon alongside polished tannins."
US,92.0,28.0,Applegate Valley,Cowhorn,"This is a co-ferment (with native yeast) of 45% Viognier, 30% Marsanne and 25% Roussanne. Exceptional details and mouth-pleasing textures lend extra pleasure throughout this RhÃ´ne white blend. Green melon, cucumber and tart tropical fruits carry the succulent and refreshing palate on through a deep dive into an immaculate finish."
US,86.0,15.0,Napa Valley,Tudal,"A pleasant sipper for drinking now, with citrus fruit, Asian-pear and peach flavors, accented by acidity. This 100% Sauvignon was unoaked."
US,91.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Brittan Vineyards,"Tart, tangy, and herbal, this juicy wine mixes cranberry and strawberry fruit with tomato leaf, herb and peppery spice. If new oak barrels were used, they are not showing themselves at the moment. But the balance, length and detail are delightful."
US,88.0,30.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foley,"This rich, yet balanced Chardonnay exhibits tropical fruit, peach, green apple and apricot flavors, along with notes of vanilla, honey and toast from new French oak. It's creamy and soft on the palate."
US,86.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Pat Paulsen Vineyards,"Notes of milk chocolate accompany black currant, green olive and toasty oak flavors in this dry, creamy 100% Cabernet. It's not an ager, but will be fine through 2017."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Sicilia,Benanti,"Il Drappo is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that has been aged carefully in oak to produce a soft, rich mouthfeel and lively notes of bright berry and savory spice. There's a touch of toasted pistachio nut as well."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,Clarendelle,"This lively wine comes from the Clarence Dillon group (ChÃ¢teau Haut-Brion). It offers good balance between the considerable acidity and the red-berry fruit. With its spicy background, the wine is delicious to drink now."
US,85.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Cascata,"This wine offers aromas of white flowers, spice and citrus. On the palate are easygoing flavors of white fruit, flowers and minerally spice. A simply good white wine with a feminine touch."
France,90.0,25.0,Coteaux du Languedoc,ChÃ¢teau de Lancyre,"Kirsch, black currant, cured meat and foliage notes lead the way on this concentrated, tightly structured wine. Dried black cherry and fresh garrigue herbs fill the velvety textured mouth, and linger well into the finish alongside a touch of cocoa powder flavor. Drink now through 2014."
US,90.0,25.0,El Dorado,Perry Creek,"This inviting wine smells sweet and jammy. It tastes spicy, lightly oaky and like ripe raspberries. Full bodied and high in alcohol, it's also smooth in texture, mouthfilling and rich. Flavors like chocolate and blackberry mark the finish."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Rioja,Evaia,"Mild citrus, melon and peach aromas are clean. This wine feels solid and a touch plump, but with agility. Peach and melon flavors are simple, and it's fresh, tasty and fairly elegant on the finish."
Italy,93.0,30.0,Collio,Raccaro,"Fresh, elegant and well structured, this gorgeous white offers heady aromas of spring wild flower, white stone fruit, citrus and an inviting whiff of toasted nut. It's bright and savory, delivering yellow apple, nectarine drop and almond while a saline note wraps around the lingering finish."
US,86.0,46.0,Russian River Valley,El Lugar,"Minty sage and cedar dot the aromatic profile of this wine that is holding on to tannin and oak with a fierce stubbornness. Tart cherry, pomegranate and blueberry give it a fruity mÃ©lange, accented by subtle rose petal and violet."
US,92.0,32.0,Calaveras County,Allegorie,"Rich, balanced and complex, this offers lots of drinking pleasure. Aromas are lightly earthy and smoky, while flavors are full, layered, ripe but subtle enough to require more and more sips. The mouthfeel is the ideal combination of smooth juiciness supported by lots of fine tannins to give it a palate-cleansing effect."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Langhe,Ca' del Baio,"This young Nebbiolo is loaded with ripe red cherry and black raspberry sensations accented with notes of white pepper. It's straightforward, with a round, soft palate and velvety tannins. Not an ager so enjoy this soon."
US,91.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,Savage Grace,"This wine comes from three-year-old vines at this esteemed vineyard. Lighter in color, it has aromas that pop and are very primary, with notes of boysenberry, raspberry and herb. Lighter in style, the flavors are pure and direct, showing no new oak influence (neutral barrels for four months) and an appealing feel. The purity is dazzling. It impresses on its own but is meant to be shown at the dinner table."
Australia,89.0,17.0,Margaret River,Wildberry Estate,"Full-bodied and firm, this dark-fruited Shiraz an be consumed now with rare beef or lamb, or cellared 2?? years. Cola and blackberry fruit dominate, with notes of chocolate and cedar chiming in on the finish."
France,88.0,18.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Vignerons des Terres SecrÃ¨tes,"Rich and round, the wine boasts ripe toast and creamy pear and peach fruit. The lemon touches give point to this full wine, adding attractive freshness."
France,88.0,15.0,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,"An almost creamy wave of pear fruit hits the nose. The palate is equally soft and full fruited, boosted by residual sweetness that makes the fruit fluid and rounded. This is countered by ample zesty freshness that has a pithy slightly bitter edge. The finish is just off dry and clean."
France,90.0,17.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Domaine de l'Ecu,"This is the entry-level wine from this biodynamic estate. It is full of flavor, ripe from the lees aging and with intense acidity to balance. It goes more to the apple side of Muscadet, producing a wine that is rich and full bodied. Drink from late 2017."
US,88.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Roots,"At first quite tart, almost sour, with a strong yeasty aroma, this unusual wine can seem simple and dilute. Give it several hours to open up and it rewards you with delicate yet persistent flavors of citrus and stone, with refreshing acidity. Such low-alcohol white wines can be a delight with shellfish and other appetizers."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Sicilia,Botter,"Merlot and Nero d'Avola are blended to produce an easy wine with good integrity of fruit and fresh berry flavors. This a soft, plush wine that would pair well with home-cooked pasta or risotto."
US,85.0,15.0,California,Donovan-Parke,"Made in the popular style, this features flavors of Meyer lemon, orange, grass, vanilla and white pepper. Although it's sugary-tasting, it's brightened by acidity. Nice to drink with slightly sweet Asian fare or popcorn shrimp."
France,88.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Vaucouleurs,"Organically grown grapes have resulted in a soft, crisp and clean wine. It has bright pure fruits with white-peach and red-currant flavors along with stylish acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
US,91.0,35.0,McMinnville,Martin Woods,"Aromatic and stylish, this Dijon-clone Chardonnay jumps out with sweet spices on the nose and a floral twist to the palate. Pollen, apple and white-peach flavors punch through into a well-balanced, lingering finish. It drinks nicely already but should continue to improve through 2023."
Spain,86.0,14.0,Alicante,La Bodega de Pinoso,Cherry and plum aromas are a touch grassy on this compact but extracted Monastrell. Cherry and black-plum flavors rumble away on a grabby rubbery tannic finish. This is a big loud warm-climate wine where elegance and finesse are not factors.
Italy,84.0,65.0,Val di Cornia Suvereto,Volpaiole,"Here's a Merlot that presents simple but slightly muddled aromas of spice and fruit. The distinction between its various aromatic elements is not that clear, and the wine delivers a one-dimensional feel on the close."
Italy,88.0,36.0,Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,La Tordera,"Delicate notes of white mineral and jasmine flower open this Prosecco from the famed Cartizze cru. The wine delivers sweet floral tones backed by peach and honeysuckle, yet just the right level of acidity kicks in at the end to keep the palate cool and refreshed."
US,85.0,37.0,Sonoma County,Williams Selyem,This has some simple flavors of sour cherry candy and oak. The structure is overly soft and lacking tension. Drink up.
US,91.0,25.0,Dry Creek Valley,Dry Creek Vineyard,"Dry Creek produced this wine and then held it back all of this time to let it properly mellow. It's beautiful?softly lush, dry and complex in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with a spicy, briary character that makes it savory."
Italy,84.0,20.0,Sicilia,Fazio,"Fazio's Insolia embraces a broader, wider approach with flatter texture and aromas. It doesn't have those distinguished aromatic accents that you sometimes find in Insolia, but it does offer warm peach, almond and citrus fruit instead."
US,91.0,34.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Vine Hill,"Stylistically, this Pinot is right in the middle of the big, blowsy style and the more austere, low-alcohol style. It's balanced, dry and rich in cherry and raspberry-pie flavors, with an opulent overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Drink now??015."
US,92.0,39.0,Napa Valley,V. Sattui,"Give this Zin extra points for sheer power. The vineyard consists of two parcels in St. Helena that date to the 1930s or earlier. It's a tremendous wine, dry, full-bodied and strong in alcohol, with blackberry, blueberry, red currant, licorice, black pepper and cedar flavors."
France,86.0,10.0,Vin de France,Patriarche PÃ¨re et Fils,Black fruit and soft tannins yield a wine that is rounded with some attractive texture. Its ripe black currant fruitiness is lifted by its crisp acidity. Drink now.
US,90.0,38.0,Rockpile,Keating,"Complex tannins confound the palate at first, but mellow on the back side, inviting gregarious amounts of leather, black pepper and blackberry, a waft of cigar smoke in the mix, too. Fuller-bodied in style, the wine will benefit from time; cellar through 2020."
US,86.0,49.0,Sonoma Mountain,Roadhouse Winery,"There's a slightly unripe vegetal note to this Pinot. Despite some good black raspberries and currants and oak, that green note persists, modulating the wine's pleasures. Drink now."
US,88.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,BergstrÃ¶m,"Lean and crisp despite bells and whistles of barrel fermentation and lees aging. Sure, that adds richness and depth, but the wine stays true to its roots with high acidity and the flavor profile of apples, not pineapples. It's a distinguished wine. That's not a technical term, but it gets the point across."
US,91.0,29.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"High toned aromas mark the nose of this wine, including dried herb, fresh plum, huckleberry and spice. Its purple fruit flavors are rich and lush, with a pleasing purity that carries through the finish. It's uncharacteristic of Sangiovese but brings undeniable appeal."
US,92.0,38.0,Calistoga,Vermeil,"The wine, from this old vineyard, contains a good chunk of Petite Sirah, which adds body and tannins to the Zinfandel. It's a delicious wine, wonderfully drinkable, with deep, complex blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate, licorice, raisin, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish long and spicy."
US,90.0,25.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Longoria,"There's wet river-stone freshness to this bright white wine by Rick Longoria, which also shows grapefruit blossoms, lemon balm and a touch of grassiness on the nose. There's verve on the sip, with lemongrass, kiwi and lime-skin flavors making for a very tight and green-leaning palate."
US,87.0,27.0,Willamette Valley,Twill,"Ripe apple and banana flavors lead this native yeast-fermented, oak-aged wine. Its loose-knit mix of fruit seems on the cusp of oxidation and is countered with tart, lemony acidity."
US,92.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Loring Wine Company,"Elegance and subtlety are the hallmarks of this medium-bodied, ultrasmooth wine. It pulls all the elements together, from the nervy, red cherry aromas to the moderate raspberry flavors, the great balance of acid and tannins vs. alcohol, and the velvety mouthfeel."
US,83.0,18.0,Ancient Lakes,Cave B,Notes of rhubarb and cherry don't stitch together. It drinks just off dry with a tart finish.
US,94.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Continuing to preserve this historic vineyard, a rare planting of the variety within the appellation, this is an elegant yet explosive bottling. Blackberry and stone fruit tones are framed by soft, gentle tannins, sprinkled liberally with cardamom. A floral aroma permeates gently refreshing acidity and a finish of dark chocolate."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Friuli Venezia Giulia,Livio Felluga,"Boasts penetrating grapefruit aromas but also some warm, peachy accents. On the palate, its stony and minerally flavors play against a richly textured mouthfeel. The long, delicate finish shows hints of pepper and grapefruit."
Spain,89.0,16.0,Campo de Borja,Borsao,"This is a really good example of a blended wine from AragÃ³n. It's 50% Garnacha with 25% each Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon, and thus it is more complex and interesting than your run-of-the-mill varietal Grenache. Mellow aromas of ripe fruit and spice open things up, followed by balanced flavors of berry fruits, vanilla and cream. Easygoing and highly recommended for the price."
US,85.0,26.0,Willamette Valley,Oak Knoll,"This single vineyard selection is softly herbal, with peppery strawberry fruit. The finish leaves an impression of water crackers."
US,91.0,18.0,Clements Hills,Bokisch,"This has 10% Monastrell in the mix, and it is a sublime example of what flavors of baked raspberry compote, cranberry and black licorice can do when allowed to mingle together in liquid form. Medium in body, this has a lot of earthiness. It would make a fine alternative to more expensive Pinots."
France,85.0,14.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Joinin,"Crisp acidity dominates this black-currant flavored wine. It's all about fresh fruit, soft tannins and benevolent acidity. It's pepperd with hints of licorice and spice. Likely to be drinkable in the next year."
US,90.0,38.0,Dry Creek Valley,Kokomo,"This wine offers a wealth of dried cherry, chocolate and licorice, remaining relatively medium bodied and sublime on the palate. Hints of dried herb and minerally thickets of violet dot the experience."
France,93.0,40.0,Sancerre,Domaine Laporte,Organically grown grapes are the source of this wine that comes from selected parcels on the Domaine de Rochoy. Flint soil gives a strongly mineral character that permeates the wine. The tight and steely texture contrasts happily with the sliced apple and lemon flavors. It needs to age for several more months. Drink from late 2017.
US,93.0,48.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Barden,"There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality."
France,90.0,10.0,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,"Mid-gold color. Very mineral driven with subtle aromas of bruised apple and stone fruit compote. Crisp, fairly taut palate showing strong minerality and ripe flavors of red apple, cantaloupe, sweet nectarine and spice. Taut and precise texture with a long, slightly austere finish."
US,90.0,14.0,Dry Creek Valley,Chelsea Goldschmidt,"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak."
US,83.0,18.0,Sonoma County,Wellington,"Four-plus years haven't helped to soften or sweeten this tough, herbal Cab. It's bone dry and lean, even austere in flavor, leaving the alcohol and powerful tannins to dominate."
France,88.0,35.0,Santenay,Domaine Julie Belland,"The wine comes from the highest point of the slope above Santenay, giving it an attractive cool and crisp character. With its delicious, refreshing acidity as well as ripe pear flavors it is balanced, minerally and with fine acidity. The aftertaste confirms that the wine is ready to drink."
US,87.0,24.0,Alta Mesa,Quinta Cruz,"The deep, saturated color and vivid, smoky flavors indicate a monster wine, but the reality is more complex and interesting. It smells like boysenberry, grilled beef and black pepper, tastes grapey and berrylike but also roasted and savory. It is surprisingly light-bodied considering how flavorful it is."
US,92.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Flora Springs,"This is a lovely, 100% varietal wine, balanced between savory, almost sanguine meaty notes, and complex layers of cassis, plum and blueberry. Medium bodied with an elegance at its core, it has streaks of subtle cinnamon that give spiciness, and a finish dusted in Mexican chocolate."
US,87.0,48.0,Sonoma Valley,Keating,"A rich, chocolaty Cabernet, sweet in glycerine, blackberry jam and toast flavors, brushed with spices. Good tannins and acids, but it's a bit on the sweet side."
US,90.0,20.0,Red Mountain,Page Cellars,"Don't look for grassy or herbaceous flavors, because there is not a trace of either. This is a stand-alone style that turns the usually snarly, gooseberry-flavored Sauvignon Blanc grape into a honeyed pussycat, ripe and   tropical and slightly sweet, with a toffee candy finish."
US,91.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mark Ryan,"This satiny, slightly waxy Viognier is a blend from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Olsen fruit; for the first time, roughly 10% was fermented in a concrete egg. Aromatic with yellow apples, lemon curd, bee pollen and floral highlights, it's underscored with a lick of wet stone."
US,91.0,38.0,Sonoma Coast,Red Car,"The majority of the grapes for this lithe, elegant wine come from the Zio Tony Vineyard, with the remainder from Red Car Estate. Cool-climate in its high-toned acidity and delicate features of rose and lavender, it's smooth, soft and vibrantly shaken with white pepper, a classic call-out to the Northern RhÃ´ne."
Italy,89.0,14.0,Trento,Rotari,"With its well-recognized yellow label, Rotari's Brut Talento (based on Chardonnay grapes) offers value and quality with toasty aromas of roasted almond, freshly baked bread and yellow fruit. The wine is creamy and smooth with a touch of citrus freshness on the close."
US,88.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,McGregor,"Sunny, peachy sweetness abounds in this light-footed Riesling. Off dry in style, it's breathlessly fresh and fruity, yet intensified by shimmering lime and mineral tones. Drink now for its youthful effervescence."
France,96.0,120.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020??035."
US,88.0,20.0,Edna Valley,Sextant,"Rich in tangerine, mango and lime fruit, with buttered toast and honey notes, this Chardonnay displays the intensely tart acidity that Edna Valley is famous for. It's a clean, vibrant wine for drinking now."
US,95.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Vinifera,"Here's a young, vital, impressive 100% Cabernet. It's dry, full-bodied and rich in classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, graphite and minerals, wrapped into silky tannins. Superb oak integration lends notes of vanilla and sandalwood. Just gorgeous in the mouth, filled with class and elegance. Now??014, at least."
Italy,92.0,67.0,Barolo,Luigi Oddero & Figli,"Red berry, baking spice, mint, leather and rose petal aromas emerge on this beautiful, balanced Barolo. It shows remarkable freshness for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and a balsamic note alongside polished tannins and bright acidity."
US,90.0,24.0,El Dorado,Skinner,"Appley aromas and peachy flavors make this medium-bodied wine taste bright but dry, while the generous texture gives it some nice heft on the palate. Good acidity comes through, too, for a clean and refreshing finish."
Italy,86.0,10.0,Sicilia,MandraRossa,"A consistent wine, year in and year out, MandraRossa's fresh Nero d'Avola would pair perfectly with pizza or simple spaghetti and tomato sauce. It shows loads of cola, licorice, dark fruit and bright acidity on the close."
Argentina,81.0,9.0,Argentina,San Huberto,"This rusty, light-bodied Cab may be from the current vintage but it looks, smells and tastes like something left over from the past. The bouquet is raw, leathery and leafy, with few pleasantries. A dilute palate with dry, leathery cherry flavors is fresh and light, but strained."
France,91.0,23.0,Vin de France,Domaine des Terrisses,"Prunelard (or Prunelart) is a Gaillac grape that had almost disappeared. Revived by a few enterprising producers, it produces a distinctly fruity, aromatic wine. This bottling's firm edge of tannins and juicy acidity contribute structure and intense fruitiness. Still bursting with youth, it should be aged for another year. Drink from 2018."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Morellino di Scansano,Fattoria Le Pupille,"This structured red features aromas of tilled soil and ripe berry. The palate delivers violet, mature black cherry, crushed berry and ground white pepper alongside smooth, polished tannins. It's ripe and ready, so enjoy soon."
Spain,83.0,11.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Finca Salazar,Oily aromas of orange peel are inoffensive. A shearing palate offers little textural pleasure or complexity. Flavors of lemon and blood orange finish with a sour note of underripe pineapple.
Italy,91.0,65.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Altesino,"Altesino is part of an elite group of vintners that really put Montalcino on the international wine map. Its 2008 Brunello shows some of the nervous acidity that is typical of the vintage, but it also delivers soft tones of cherry fruit, spice and chocolate that round off any sharp edges."
France,90.0,17.0,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner,"An aromatic hint of pine mixes with the red cherry notes on the nose, creating a very appetizing opening. The ultralight palate is translucent and slender, with the same leafy conifer aromas and lots and lots of red currant brightness and freshness. The light crunchy nature of this wine suggests that this is ideal for chilling. It's a weightless, very aromatic, and ultra-light-bodied red."
US,86.0,30.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Cru,"A super-fruity, direct Pinot, rather one-dimensional in cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and crisp, with a silky texture, it's a good wine to drink now."
France,85.0,10.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Sauvion,"This wine is as light as a feather. It's crisp with citrus acidity and is totally ready to drink. It is clean, perfumed with an attractive, fruity aftertaste."
US,87.0,17.0,Central Coast,Edna Valley Vineyard,"Black slate, vanilla and red cherries show on the nose of this widely available wine, which is nicely complex for such a large case load. The palate is medium in body but heartily spiced, with dark pomegranate and cherry-pie flavors hanging on a chalky tannic structure."
Argentina,90.0,19.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Trivento,"A big, intense Malbec with giant black fruit aromas that veer toward medicinal. The palate is sizable and sticky, with grabby tannins bulking up sweet, ripe blackberry flavors. Finishes with mocha and creamy vanilla flavors. Chewy, broad and on the money."
France,89.0,25.0,Vin de France,GÃ©rard Bertrand,"This organic wine, produced with a natural and biodynamic approach, is an interesting blend of 30% Syrah, 20% Grenache, 10% MourvÃ¨dre, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 10% Marselan. It offers pronounced earthy characteristics, as well as a citrusy kick (like tangerine oil) to the blueberry and blackberry fruit core. The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors."
Italy,88.0,27.0,Barbera d'Alba,Massolino,"Aromas of blackberry, underbrush, blue flowers and a whiff of coffee lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry and white pepper alongside firm acidity. Drink through 2016 to capture the combination of fruit and freshness."
US,85.0,35.0,Lake Chelan,Tildio,"Slender and acid driven, this Tempranillo, with its light berry and herb flavors, resolves with a lemony, chalky finish."
France,87.0,18.0,Beaujolais,Vignerons des Pierres DorÃ©es,"From vines around the medieval castle, this wine has brilliant cherry flavors that give fruitiness and balancing acidity. There is a refreshing juicy character that is sustained by the subtle touch of tannin. Drink the wine now."
Italy,86.0,25.0,Alto Adige,Peter Zemmer,"Here's an earthy red that opens with aromas suggesting smoke, tilled soil and leather. The solid, straightforward palate offers mature plum and a hint of almond alongside rather grainy, astringent tannins. Drink through 2017."
US,93.0,85.0,Yountville,Rocca,"This 100% varietal wine opens in crayon wax, pencil lead and black pepper. Brooding acidity complements the big, ripe fruit and sizable tannins, accented by hints of dried tobacco and cinnamon. This wine could stand a decant, vigorous swirl or cellaring, through 2028."
US,87.0,80.0,Lake County,Xurus,"A savory, tannic and slightly earthy Cabernet Sauvignon made by winemakers Denis and May-Britt Malbec, who consult on many Napa Valley-based projects. The 2007 and 2009 are more indicative of how silky smooth and refined their Cabernets can be, with this one exhibiting just slightly too much tobacco and smoke on the finish, overpowering the berry fruit."
US,85.0,19.0,Santa Barbara County,Pali,"Lots of sweet raspberry, cherry and sugar-coated doughnut flavors in this simple little Pinot. It has the virtues of silkiness and good acidity. Drink now."
Italy,84.0,13.0,Chianti,Bellini,"Bellini's easygoing Chianti opens with dried spice, white pepper and red fruit, following to the palate with fresh acidity and a lean consistency. Pair this wine with a heaping plate of pasta and tomato sauce."
France,89.0,60.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau d'Esclans,"This smells ripe and full, and the palate confirms it. The wine is wood-aged and this broadens its character?the extra year means fruit is diminished, while the richness is increased. The finale brings some essential acidity."
US,88.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,Eight Bells,"Made from grapes planted in 2006, this Syrah reflects its young-vine fruit in the form of light, primary, somewhat grapy flavors. It shows traces of herb and tobacco, which are balanced by tannins. All in all, this a promising start for this new vineyard block."
Italy,86.0,120.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Casa Raia,"A densely concentrated but unbalanced wine, it opens with aromas of stewed prunes, plum, oak, coconut and espresso. The heavy wood influence carries over to the palate. Black cherry notes are overwhelmed by oak, vanilla extract and coffee bean. Drying wood tannins dominate the finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Sierra Foothills,Easton,"This is a very friendly wine that is medium bodied, has a brownish tint to the color, slightly earthy aromas, warm fruit flavors like cooked cherries and a touch of brown sugar, plus a mellow lightly tannic texture."
France,88.0,30.0,Chablis,Domaine Christian Moreau PÃ¨re et Fils,"From vineyards on the cooler south bank of the Serein, this wine is crisp and tightly coiled despite the warmth of the 2015 vintage. It's built on a backbone of sturdy minerality, fleshed out with crisp, citrus fruit, and will be ready to drink from late 2017."
US,90.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Ponzi,"A big wine, round and ripe with luscious flavors of peach, pineapple and citrus fruits, layered into plenty of toasty oak. It's smooth and seductive, and the finish, which tastes like a dessert of toasty hazelnuts and cream, is especially enticing. Just a bit of heat runs through it."
France,88.0,46.0,Maranges,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"A rich and fruity wine with dense cherry and strawberry fruits and a dry, tannic structure. It has a tough edge that suggests aging potential while also bringing out a ripe character from this southernmost appellation in the CÃ´te d'Or."
US,89.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Bucher,"This wine presents as elegant and remarkably earthy, laced in a distinct tartness of cranberry and citrus. Lighter styled, it is integrated in tannin and oak, allowing for a smooth texture."
France,87.0,20.0,Sancerre,Joseph Mellot,"One of the more herbaceous Sauvignons in Joseph Mellot's range, this is crisp, leaning to green fruits although with an underlying feeling of ripeness. There is a touch of minerality in the texture, giving the acidity a taut, nervy feeling at the end. Screwcap."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Prima CuvÃ©e,"Aromas of white spring flowers, grapefruit and Bartlett pear lead the nose. The bright palate offers lime zest, green apple and a note of white peach alongside bright acidity and a foaming mousse."
US,87.0,17.0,Finger Lakes,Penguin Bay,"The Finger Lakes has some excellent micro-climates for GewÃ¼rztraminer and Penguin Bay's 2007 is the proof. The nose is lovely, with intense notes of exotic Asian spices. The palate, while not particularly concentrated, is exquisitely balanced, leading to a fresh impression on the finish. This bottle just screams for some good Chinese food."
Spain,90.0,33.0,Rioja,Baigorri,Waxy lightly toasted aromas of yellow apple are more subtle than popping. This barrel-fermented wine offers good weight and balance along with quiet flavors of spiced apple and vanilla. A sophisticated clean finish is lightly oaked in flavor and smooth in feel.
Italy,94.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenuta Vitanza,"A wine made in dedication from a loving wife to her husband, Andretta opens with dark concentration and generous aromas of dark licorice, cherry fruit, leather, tobacco, teriyaki and spice. The inky color is dark and daunting, but the wine is actually more nuanced and elegant than you'd expect, with balanced acidity and fine tannins."
US,91.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Darby,"This Bordeaux blend is solidly in the Darby style, but bigger and fuller and rounder than the other wines, with lovely, plummy aromas that lead into mouth-filling blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit. The use of 75% new oak is not intrusive; it's truly just an accent, and does not overtake the fruit."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Cortona,La Calonica,"From the Cortona area of eastern Tuscany, here is a simple, bright and crisp expression of Sangiovese that would pair with grilled meat or sausage."
Italy,90.0,50.0,Rosazzo,Livio Felluga,"Made with Friulano, Pinot Bianco, Sauvignon, Malvasia and Ribolla Gialla, this structured white opens with enticing aromas of candied citrus zest, light oak, chopped herb and almond. The firm palate offers baked apple, nectarine, coconut, toast, vanilla and a confectionary note."
Argentina,86.0,13.0,Vista Flores,Mil Piedras,"Light, clean, fresh aromas of tropical fruits and lychee resemble those of a TorrontÃ©s. The palate is light and mild, while flavors of melon, lychee and citrus pith are forward but don't come with a lot of backing or complexity."
US,84.0,23.0,California,Bota Box,"A sweet smell like raisins and very ripe, grapy flavors ride a soft, broad texture and medium body. It's not too dry and it's not at all tannic. It's easy and gentle to drink."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Brian Carter Cellars,"Hot pink in color, this wine offer plentiful aromas of cherry and watermelon. It drinks off dry, with sugary sweet-fruit flavors that provide appeal."
US,90.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Kaleidos,"Well-integrated blueberry and purple flower aromas make for a casual rather than bombastic nose in this blend of 32% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 25% MourvÃ¨dre and 15% Petite Sirah. Roasted meat, charred blackberry and dried fennel notes show on the palate, feeling very balanced and acid-even."
US,82.0,8.0,California,Twisted,"This Merlot gets your basic dry, full-bodied red wine job done in an inexpensive way. It has raisiny flavors and lots of crunchy acidity."
US,84.0,10.0,Central Coast,MommyJuice,"It hardly matters what varieties this white blend is made from. It's just fine for a ten buck wine, with sweet citrus fruit and vanilla flavors and a nice kick of acidity."
US,91.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,Black Kite,"A block of vines set literally near a grove of Redwood trees, the 2010 Redwood's Edge is structured and slightly austere and elusive, a concentrated rendering of deep, dark red fruit, lavender and woody undertones that's incredibly delicious."
Australia,88.0,35.0,Yarra Valley,Yeringberg,"Made in a lighter, more delicate style than many of its brethren, this is nevertheless fresh and flavorful. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by hints of toasted brioche, which takes on a slightly mocha-like character on the finish."
Italy,89.0,130.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Fornace,"Aromas of underbrush, leather, dried plum, a whiff of French oak and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, licorice and espresso set against close-grained that leave a firm, rather drying finish."
France,92.0,30.0,Bourgueil,Domaine les Pins,"This is the top wine from Pitault-Landry at Domaine les Pins. It is concentrated, ripe and firmly structured. Wood aging has smoothed the texture and brought out the red fruits. It still could age further with its generous fruitiness. Drink from late 2017."
France,84.0,12.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Cornemps,"Ripe and smooth, this is rich with red berries. A touch of pepper accompanies a zesty texture that backs up the fruitiness. Drink now."
US,89.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"A tribute to the art of blending, this wine is a mix of 10 different varieties with none making up even a third of the blend. It leads with aromas of plummy blue fruit, smoke, vanilla and herbs followed by plump fruit flavors and lightly grippy tannins."
Spain,94.0,50.0,Ribera del Duero,Emilio Moro,"Deep berry aromas blend with sweet, creamy, spicy oak notes on the nose of this cellar-worthy bruiser, which is live-wire, energetic and holding a lot in reserve. A full allotment of oak-driven flavors include coffee, mocha, pepper, baked berry and chocolate. On the finish, it's huge and tastes of toast, medicinal berry and chocolate-drenched cherries. Drink from 2015??025."
Italy,82.0,15.0,Friuli Venezia Giulia,Pierpaolo Pecorari,"Any baseball fan will peg the nose as being that of ballpark franks with yellow mustard. That strange meaty, pickled, spicy character carries onto the palate, where there's also some mineral character. The finish is clipped and short, which is probably a benefit after all the funky aromatics and flavors that come before."
France,86.0,20.0,Petit Chablis,La Chablisienne,This is delicate and crisply fruity. Its acidity and citrus presence offer a fragrant character that contrasts nicely with the more creamy texture.
US,83.0,15.0,California,Seven Daughters,"If only this blend of seven popular varieties were drier, it would score higher. It's crisp in acidity and complex in orange, peach, pear, honeysuckle, vanilla and mineral flavors. But the sugary finish puts it into the fruit juice category."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Bolgheri,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,"Le Serre Nuove presents an intense and harmonious bouquet that is accented by opulent notes of black cherry, chocolate, cinnamon spice, leather and tobacco. The blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet France and Petit Verdot ends long on the close with enduring density and velvety texture."
US,82.0,14.0,Paso Robles,Zinsane,Unripe vegetal flavors mar this Zinfandel. There's an asparagus note to the blackberries that interferes with your enjoyment.
US,91.0,39.0,Red Mountain,Efeste,"Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs."
US,92.0,34.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ross Andrew,"The Boushey character shines through in this elegant, complex wine. A lovely, sensual mix of loam, mushroom, tobacco and black cherry blends into a stylish wine with exceptional detail all the way through its lengthy finish."
US,85.0,25.0,Virginia,Greenhill,"Green pear and golden apple aromas lead onto the palate, which is edged by peppy acids."
US,86.0,15.0,Lodi,LangeTwins,"Perfumed in leathery cinnamon-cola and cedar with gobs of tannin, it will get you through a party or midweek meals."
Italy,87.0,10.0,Romagna,Fattoria Zerbina,"This opens with delicate aromas of black-skinned berry, dark spice and cinnamon. The straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry, clove and a hint of white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon."
US,89.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Brooks,"Put this into the budget category (for Oregon Pinot Noir) where it shines. Fruity and forward, there's plenty to like in the mix of orange flesh and rind, and strawberry and cherry hard candy. The fruit is backed with ample tannin, and a warm touch of mocha and toast fills in the finish."
US,90.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Ramey,"Sourced from Bucher Vineyard on Westside Road and Platt Vineyard in the Sonoma Coast, this wine is light-bodied and fresh on the palate, offering baked raspberry, cardamom, clove and forest flavors."
France,90.0,25.0,Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"Very pure notes of cherry and strawberry pervade this wine. They are perfumed with a slight conifer scent that spells freshness and lifted ease. The palate has an unforced, elegant concentration. This is charming and fresh, with convincing depth, purity and a lasting, fresh finish."
US,85.0,22.0,Edna Valley,Claiborne & Churchill,"Vibrant and racy, this Chard's bright acidity boosts and brightens the lime, pineapple, Meyer lemon and vanilla flavors. Try with grilled salmon with a tropical fruit salsa topping."
France,84.0,13.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Domaine du Trapadis,"Already lightening in color and possessing only modest cherry fruit, this supple wine should be consumed over the next few months."
US,93.0,45.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Talley,"Incredible depth of fruit, a bit reined in right now, but still exhibiting dark cherries, tar, leather and spices. Deep cherry flavors with a touch of anise or licorice. Excellent mouthfeel. Huge, almost overripe notes on the finish, but quite unevolved."
US,86.0,22.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Star Lane Vineyard,"Elegant, dryish to off-dry and crisp in acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc has forward flavors of gooseberries, limes, white  sugar and vanilla. It's clean and fine to drink now."
US,91.0,29.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Flying Trout,"Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length."
US,93.0,110.0,Napa Valley,Frazier,"Another successful Cab from Frazier, following on the heels of the outstanding 2008 vintage. Like that wine, this one is elaborately ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and toasty oak, with a long, spicy finish. The structure is impeccable, showing firm tannins and fine balancing acidity. Great to drink now, and will age for at least 10 years."
US,88.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Browne Family Vineyards,"The aromas bring plenty of appeal, with notes of coffee, herbs, vanilla and woodspice. However the concentration of the cherry flavors doesn't seem entirely there, tapering toward the finish where the oak takes over."
US,86.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Pangloss Cellars,"Juicy and dense in blackberry fruit, it offers lingering notes of cedar and cassis with a lingering finish of wood."
US,92.0,50.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Fess Parker,"This age-worthy wine smells like the shady side of a mountain, with black olive notes and roasted fennel alongside cedar-spiced strawberries and brambly berries. Both firm tannins and pungent acidity fuel the palate, with cherry, raspberry and slightly bitter espresso. Drink 2020??025."
US,87.0,26.0,Virginia,Sunset Hills,"This has a tropical- and grapy-scented nose, with notes of pineapple and melon at the fore. On the palate, this Viognier is voluptuous and intense, offering a peachy flavor and perky acidity that invigorate the palate."
US,86.0,12.0,California,Cartlidge & Browne,"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops."
US,86.0,30.0,Colorado,Sutcliffe,"A scent of pastry dough encases the broad notes of spiced dark fruit and flower on this Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, and it bears firm tannins and bright acids that carry onto the medium to long finish."
US,90.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Franciscan,"Smooth, rich and tannic, and lovely for drinking now. You'll find blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors, leading to a dry finish. Give it a little time in a decanter before pouring."
Italy,88.0,32.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Ca' de Lion Ghione,"This has subdued aromas of baking spice and black-skinned fruit. The smooth, rounded palate delivers clove, black cherry and licorice flavors alongside polished tannins. It's already rather evolved so drink soon."
US,82.0,10.0,California,Coyote Creek,"Serve this affordable Merlot at big parties. It's a fairly dull wine, but serviceable, with currant, spice and oak flavors."
US,90.0,33.0,Sierra Foothills,Andis,"This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table."
US,84.0,20.0,Western Connecticut Highlands,Hopkins Vineyard,"This has all of the easygoing, good raspberry and blueberry flavors that a Cabernet Franc should. The nose is rich in raspberry and pepper, and on the palate, the wine has good structure and length. Pair with lasagna or a spiced meat dish for extra appeal."
France,90.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Barbeiranne,"Produced from 40-year-old vines, this wine is ripe, full of red fruits with good concentration. It is packed with crisp acidity and lively fruitiness, making it refreshing and drinkable. The lees aging before bottling has added extra depth to the flavors. Drink now."
Argentina,88.0,15.0,Mendoza,Finca Vides,"Fresh and not too oaky on the bouquet, with apple comprising the fruit element. Feels full and a bit rich, with plump, sweet flavors of apple touched up by spice. Turns stickier and more sweet on the finish, but overall this is a very solid Chard for the money."
Italy,88.0,14.0,Umbria,La Carraia,"A delicious blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese, this opens with earthy aromas of freshly turned soil, black fruit and underbrush. The palate delivers flavors of juicy plum and black cherry, all laced with tobacco, clove and nutmeg and presented in a brooding but read-to-enjoy style."
US,89.0,17.0,Mendocino,Kendall-Jackson,"This full-bodied wine combines spicy aromas with deep fruit flavors like plum and blackberry. The fresh, juicy texture has just enough tannin to make it appetizing. The wine has enough heft to pair well with a lot of savory and meaty dishes."
Spain,84.0,13.0,Toro,Valsanzo,"Lots of leather and churned earth on the nose, and with time plum and tomato notes enter the party. It's a forward, aggressive Tempranillo with jumpy red-fruit flavors and a long, angular finish. Not really a wine for connoisseurs, but good for everyday consumption."
US,83.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Carr,"Despite officially low alcohol of just 14%, this Grenache tastes hot and prickly. The cherry and currant flavors aren't fleshy enough to prevent the acids, tannins and alcohol from dominating."
US,88.0,10.0,California,Pepi,"Pepi is doing a great job lately making inexpensive white wines, and with this Sauvignon Blanc, the winery really knocks it out of the park. This is bone dry, mouthwateringly tart in acidity and complex, offering flavors of green grass, gooseberry, lime, vanilla and white pepper. It should be relatively easy to find thanks to its production of 10,000 cases."
France,93.0,140.0,Champagne,Chanoine,"Of the many flamboyant Champagne bottles, this is one of the most stylish with its elegant frosted glass. This aromatic wine is a 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir blend, with a crisp texture and fruits that are maturing well. It is ready to drink now."
US,88.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Carol Shelton,"This RhÃ´ne-style blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier is rich in honey, pineapple, peach and orange flavors. It has fine acidity and a steely core of minerals. Everything about it strongly suggests ham, bacon or sausages."
US,91.0,24.0,Paso Robles,Vina Robles,"With modest alcohol and an attractive herbaceousness, this Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with a little Petit Verdot. For those looking for a drier, more linear wine, it offers a viable alternative to a Napa Cabernet. It's a great example of the art of blending, selected from five different vineyards all over Paso Robles. It's rich in blackberries, currants and sage. This is the winery's best Cabernet yet for such a good price."
US,86.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Hogue,"Pepper, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to silky-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It doesn't stand up on its own but should fit in nicely at the dinner table."
France,86.0,14.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Georges Duboeuf,"Taut and textured, yet ripe and soft, this has a nectarine flavor that's balanced by a note of fresh lime. The finish is easy, nervy and zingy."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Carpineto,"This zesty red has pretty aromas that suggest small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of moist soil. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins."
US,95.0,38.0,Mendocino Ridge,Donkey & Goat,"This Perli is a gem, a gorgeous reminder that California Syrah can be a liquified representation of beauty. Carrying violet overtones, the wine offers just-picked raspberry and a pronounced entry of peppery spice. Soft it has a long finish and complex subtleties approaching magic. Sit this wine in your cellar if you dare?it's so good to drink now."
Argentina,87.0,45.0,CalchaquÃ­ Valley,Bodega Tacuil,"This wine is herbal, prickly and roasted, singing the Salta tune of oddness and earthiness. It feels medium to full in the mouth, with a roasted dark-berry flavor and plenty of herb and pimiento tones. Finishes deep but salty, with notes of roasted red pepper and stew. A blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,84.0,18.0,El Dorado,Charles B. Mitchell,"This smells like plums and blueberries, tastes smooth and rather rich, showing light spicy, oak accents over the plummy flavors. It's medium bodied, rather light on tannins and acidity, so it has a soft texture overall."
US,91.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Joseph Phelps,"With a rich, caramel-teased nose, this is a full-bodied and voluptuous Chardonnay that evolves in the glass to display much greater sophistication and concentration. It finishes light and lemony, rounded out by juicy stone fruit."
US,81.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Lucas & Lewellen,"Too sweet in jellied blackberries and cherries, and too acidic, which gives it the taste of a sauce in a Chinese restaurant."
US,91.0,20.0,Sonoma Valley,Kenwood,"A picture-perfect Zinfandel from this famous vineyard. It's dry and soft in tannins and acids, and while it's a little high and sweet in alcohol, it's not too much. The raspberry, cherry, tobacco and bacon flavors finish in a swirl of peppery spices."
US,88.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Lange,"This stiffens up with streaks of stem and herb, underscoring compact blueberry and blue-plum fruits. It's an eight vineyard mix, aged in 20% new French oak."
US,92.0,110.0,Stags Leap District,Chimney Rock,"This is the most expensive of the winery's new Cabs. It's also the fruitiest and most in need of time in the cellar. Right now, it's a candied blast of blackberries and cherries. The tannins are sweet and chunky, and the oak isn't integrated with everything else. It's awkward. But it should develop for a good 6?? years, maybe even longer. The score reflects its potential."
France,87.0,20.0,MÃ©doc,Les Hauts de Tousquiron,"Made from 30-year-old vines, this dense wine has considerable acidity that gives a fresh edge along with spice and a juicy black-currant character. It will age quickly, so drink from 2017."
US,88.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Owen Roe,"A sweet scent of violet greets you first, along with a primary purple-fruit note. It's made in a forward, fruity style, and it offers finishing notes of anise and coffee liqueur."
US,84.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,Gracianna,"There's a crushed cigarette ashiness in this otherwise pretty Pinot Noir that detracts. It steals the beauty away from the silkiness and raspberry, cherry and oak flavors."
US,90.0,60.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pursued by Bear,"Coming from two area standouts?Lewis and Phinny Hill vineyards?this wine shows appealing aromas and flavors of shaved coconut, Mounds Bar, cherry and baking spices. The barrel influence is prominent but it largely stands up to it."
France,92.0,70.0,Champagne,Le Brun de Neuville,"The small SÃ©zanne region of Champagne is known for its Chardonnay (as exemplified by this wine) with its crisp mineral texture. The apple-skin and green-plum flavors are given an edge by the tight acidity and dryness. It could do with another few months in bottle, so drink this bottling from 2018."
Argentina,85.0,10.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish."
US,88.0,22.0,Dundee Hills,Erath,"A big, juicy, fruit-bomb of a rosÃ©, this Knight's Gambit from Erath mixes flavors of rosewater, watermelon, strawberries and cocoa in a big, broad, forward, palate-pleasing wine. The pretty pink color is from skin contact with the Pinot Gris?no red wine was added."
US,93.0,45.0,Edna Valley,Center of Effort,"This is a rich, dense Pinot, with blackberries, sweet cloves, allspice, gingerbread and nutmeg aromas. The palate carries the tune, with dark raspberry, dried strawberry, cranberry sauce and black cherry notes all heavily seasoned by cardamom, pine sap, eucalyptus and sea salt."
US,91.0,110.0,Stags Leap District,Silverado,"This is the winery's reserve-level 100% Cab, given the utmost care and attention. It opens shyly in cedar and blackberry before offering a luscious palate of tangy leather, dry, firm tannins and a peppery finish. From grapes designated as their own Heritage Clone, UCD 30, it beautifully expresses the appellation and should cellar well through 2020."
US,89.0,46.0,Napa Valley,Artesa,"This is a rich Cabernet, powerful in cherry- and blackberry-pie-filling flavors, which are compounded by the sweet taste of caramelized oak. The tannins are soft and easy to drink now."
US,89.0,28.0,Santa Barbara County,Municipal Winemakers,"This is a herb-driven, savory and relatively light Syrah, with crushed thyme, marjoram and black peppercorns spicing up the elderberry jam aromas. The chaparral spices take center stage on the sip, where wild sage and oak forest undergrowth play against the dark fruit. Very quaffable."
Italy,90.0,28.0,Chianti Classico,Principe Corsini Fattoria Le Corti,"Le Corti is a bright, slender expression of Chianti Classico compared to Principe Corsini's more austere Cortevecchia Riserva. This selection shows mild touches of tobacco and chocolate set over rich notes of red fruit and cherry. To maintain its freshness of fruit, this is partially aged in oak barrels, with the rest kept in cement vats."
Argentina,88.0,20.0,Mendoza,Zuccardi,"Blueberry and boysenberry aromas are deep and slightly reduced in nature. This is a chunky, wide-bodied wine with wiry acidity and more power than elegance. Flavors of roasted, toasted black fruits finish blocky and with espresso-like bitterness."
US,91.0,30.0,North Coast,Breathless,"This spicy and well-balanced wine has a light salmon color, subtle aromas like cinnamon and cherries, and flavor accents resembling cranberries, paprika and ginger. It's light to medium bodied, has very fine bubbles and a lingering finish."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,Rutini,"This friendly wine offers fresh, jammy berry and cherry aromas. The palate has a bit of grit and stickiness to it, while blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry flavors are ripe, sweet, not pushy and ultimately satisfying."
US,93.0,40.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Comartin,"There's lovely vibrancy to the nose of this bottling, with tangy cranberry, hibiscus and strawberry aromas, yet those are deftly cut by peppercorns, brown spice and turned earth. The mouthfeel is engagingly peppery, with spicy bay leaf and thyme herbs, a touch of cured Kalamata olives and an underlying, underripe raspberry and cranberry fruit base."
US,90.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this has pinpoint focus and is packed with ripe berry fruit. The oak aging (45% new) and crisp tannins layer in veins of espresso and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2022."
France,89.0,18.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Pillebois,"Big, bold tannins set this wine up with fine potential. It has structure and good concentration. Richly endowed with black fruit, it will age well. Drink from 2021."
France,88.0,17.0,Alsace,Domaine Roland Schmitt,"Fresh and fruity, this is a classic Pinot Blanc, rounded, soft and ripe. It has just a touch of spiced pear along with red apples, and a fine, fragrant layer of acidity."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Langhe,Cascina delle Rose,"Aged in steel, this vibrant wine shows Nebbiolo's more elegant and youthful side. It weaves together rose, violet, perfumed berries, bright cherry, crushed raspberry and sweet baking spices alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy it soon to capture the crunchy berry flavors."
US,87.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Bradford Mountain,"Leathery, brambly blackberry flavors and aromas arrive with a bang in this bold, generous wine. Mouthcoating in smooth, vanilla-tinged tannins and reasonable oak, it's slightly sweet in a berry cobbler way, with a hit of smoke on the finish. Small amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah are included."
US,86.0,22.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"More useful than rich, this Cab is dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, black currant, herb and smoky oak flavors. Drink now."
US,90.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"Pretty and deep, this has notes of juicy boysenberry, blueberry and cherry. The balanced acidity and racy tannins give it substance and style."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Lugana,Zenato,"This creamy, fresh wine opens with orchard fruit, citrus and banana scents. The medium-bodied palate delivers white peach and nectarine flavors, with bright acidity that leaves a tangy finish."
France,94.0,171.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Steely and tight, this is a mineral-driven wine. With its vibrant acidity and tense texture, it is a classic Chardonnay that will fill out slowly and evolve favorably with time. Beneath the tension and forward acidity is a rich wine, though it needs time to show it. Drink from 2020."
US,86.0,30.0,Monterey,Loft,"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate. It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping."
US,81.0,9.0,California,Jenica Peak,"Pretty hard to like. It's harsh in acidity, with watered-down raspberry jam flavors that finish sweet."
US,93.0,58.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"This is classic Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir, with its dark color, full body, ripe berry and currant flavors and, especially, the array of exotic crushed brown spices. New French oak brings lots of smoky, buttery, toasty richness. Great to drink now with tuna, salmon, lamb and beef dishes."
Spain,85.0,18.0,RÃ­as Baixas,MarquÃ©s de Vizhoja,"The nose on this AlbariÃ±o deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Isonzo del Friuli,Lis Neris,"Partly fermented and aged in 500-liter French barrels, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, bread crust, acacia and sage. The rounded medium-boded palate offers mature yellow-apple skin, pineapple and a hint of butterscotch while a nutty note closes the finish."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Sicilia,Principi di Spadafora,"Three native grapes ??Inzolia, Catarratto and Grillo ??create the blend and show the potential of warm climate, Sicilian whites. This is a surprisingly fresh and crisp wine ??reminiscent of cooler climates ??with pungent aromas of kiwi, honeydew melon and cut grass."
US,88.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"This pale, peach-colored wine is a blend of Syrah (55%), Sangiovese (28%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of bubble gum and herb lead to a bone-dry palate that seems to have a slight spritz. Tart citrus flavors round it out, with the focus on acidity."
US,92.0,55.0,Dundee Hills,Knudsen,"This very pretty wine is built upon soft, forward, ripe strawberry fruit, and dappled with details of cinnamon and baking spices. A touch of chocolate sneaks into the focused, lightly tarry finish, which is nicely balanced. This pioneering vineyard dates back to the 1970s, but much of it has been replanted since the beginning of this century."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Shafer,"It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years."
Italy,90.0,80.0,Barbera d'Asti,Coppo,"Violet, dark-skinned berry, toasted oak and sweet baking spice aromas float out of the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out mature blackberry, black currant, sage, green pepper and oak-driven spice framed in fine-grained tannins."
France,89.0,25.0,Minervois La Liviniere,L'Ostal Cazes,"This blend of 70% Syrah, 15% Carignan, 10% Grenache and 5% MourvÃ¨dre opens with an assertive garrigue character?lavender, thyme, bay?that's supported by notes of red berry, cherry and plum. The medium-weight mouthfeel shows fine tannins and an easy texture, while violet tones unfold on the close."
France,90.0,40.0,Champagne,Vranken,"The style of this creamy wine seems to have become drier, giving a steely tight character to go with the apple and citrus flavors. The result is attractive, very fresh, ready to drink."
US,86.0,48.0,Napa Valley,C. Beck,"A bit jammy and simple, with fresh, primary flavors of blackberries and cherries that are almost sweet. Oak adds creamy, smoky notes. Drink now."
US,90.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Martin Woods,"A distinctive, sweet, resiny note dominates the aromatics, suggesting an herbal flower such as calendula. Those notes highlight the flavors as well, with hints of pollen, fresh herb and ripe apple."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Leese-Fitch,"Bold and spicy, this dry wine is saturated with toasty oak and vanilla flavors over plum and prune. Made from mostly Petite Sirah and Syrah, it has medium body and a smooth texture."
US,87.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,"Lightly sweet blue fruit aromas and flavors mix with coffee, mocha, toast and herbs. It doesn't seem entirely like Cabernet but it's hard to ignore its appeal."
Spain,92.0,29.0,Rioja,Sierra Cantabria,"Full and smoky at first, however as it settles the bouquet delivers ripe strawberry and additional red, jammy aromas. The palate has a healthy, very nice feel and diligent flavors of red berry fruit touched up by proper oak. Finishes creamy, with vanilla and spice flavors."
Argentina,88.0,16.0,Mendoza,Valentin Bianchi,Mild aromas of balsam wood and lightly spiced raspberry and plum are subtle and unforced. This deals ample body weight and lively acidity along with savory berry flavors accented by mild herbal and leather notes. Light spice and tomato flavors mark the finish.
US,87.0,30.0,Santa Clara Valley,Sarah's Vineyard,"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate."
France,90.0,20.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,LePlan-Vermeersch,"A supple, welcoming CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne, this offering from Flemish former race-car driver Dirk Vermeersch starts off spicy and herbal but adds ample cherry fruit on the palate. It's harmonious and easy to drink, without any excessive extraction or weight."
US,93.0,48.0,Temecula Valley,Lorenzi Estate,"This is one of the better Temecula Valley wines in recent memory, with dried blackberry, leather, tar and condensed purple flowers on the nose. There's a kiss of herbs upfront on the palate, followed by layers of tangy boysenberry, caramel and salt and pepper flavors. The structure is apparent but not in the way, and the acidity is lively."
US,92.0,15.0,Lodi,Za Zin,"One of the ??2 Zins of Lodi 2014,??it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth."
US,89.0,24.0,St. Helena,Charnu,"A very rich Sauvignon Blanc that shows the creamy, smoky influence of oak barrels and lees. It's dry and soft, with flavors of citrus fruits, figs, buttered toast and white pepper."
US,91.0,90.0,Alexander Valley,PreVail,"Smoky cigar and toffee caramel hit the high notes in this soft, thick and rich reserve-level wine, sure to please fans of a full-bodied, generously layered style. Blackberry and blueberry jam provide the fruit to match the savory elements."
France,90.0,28.0,CÃ©rons,ChÃ¢teau du Seuil,"Swathes of botrytis reveal themselves seductively on this sweet wine. It is rich in flavors, but still vibrant with acidity. Fine balance and intense flavors of apricots, honey and spice give it potential to age well. Drink from 2015."
France,87.0,34.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"Pale lemon color. Delicately aromatic showing some citrus and floral notes. Crisp with moderate intensity of fresh citrus fruit, lime sherbet, spice and a little minerality. Slightly linear, pleasant and easy drinking. Medium-bodied with a moderate lemony finish."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Barbera d'Alba,Cascina Chicco,"Bright and fragrant, this opens with aromas of underbrush, rose, dark berry and a whiff of exotic spice. The savory, easy-drinking palate doles out black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and chopped herb alongside bright acidity."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Toscana,San Luciano,"Here's a blend of Sangiovese, Montepulciano, Merlot and Cabernet that doles out refined notes of almond paste, cherry liqueur, toasted nut and graphite. Power, intensity and polished tannins suggest a pairing with wild fennel seed sausage."
US,88.0,38.0,Mount Veeder,Hess Collection,"The blend is mainly Cabernet, with other Bordeaux varieties as well as 11% Syrah. It shows good concentration of black currant flavor wrapped into hard mountain tannins. It's a good, oaky wine, but give it until 2015??016 in the cellar."
US,89.0,60.0,Old Mission Peninsula,Brys,"As the top tier wine from this producer, this Pinot sees 10 months in new French oak which gives an inital char to the nose. With time in the glass this opens with notes of coffee-dusted red and black cherries. The medium-bodied palate is round and creamy in feel, with fuzzy, crushed-velvet tannins giving texture to the ripe cherry and racy currant flavors. A dusting of cocoa closes the finish."
Italy,91.0,45.0,Barolo,Vietti,"Made in a modern, more accessible style, with a stunning nose of mocha, singed meat, roses and coffee. Earth and violets prevail in the mouth and carry over to the long finish. The refined tannin structure tempts early consumption but a few years cellaring will add to the complexity."
Spain,83.0,20.0,CariÃ±ena,Ignacio MarÃ­n,"Tropical aromas of lychee are about all that stand out on the nose of this unusual Moscatel-Garnacha Blanca blend. Neither dry nor sweet, this seems caught in no man's land. A dilute mouthfeel and bitter pyrazine notes on the finish don't help this along."
Italy,88.0,60.0,Barolo,Pertinace,"This opens with aromas of toast, coffee, chopped herb and a whiff of cellar floor. The straightforward palate offers dried cherry, licorice and a hint of orange zest alongside firm tannins."
Italy,88.0,23.0,Etna,I Custodi,"The unusual but inviting medley of aromas include Mediterranean herb, sea salt, oregano, citrus and dried yellow flower. On the round palate, a saline note backs mature pear, creamy yellow apple and nectarine zest. It closes on a buttery note."
Spain,92.0,70.0,Jumilla,Casa Castillo,"Alluring aromas of cocoa powder, berry fruits, graphite and raw oak lead to a jammy palate with density and weight. This old-vines Monastrell tastes of chocolaty oak and herbal blackberry. On the finish, it's tight and rugged, with mildly scratchy tannins and a saucy aftertaste. Drink through 2022."
France,93.0,44.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de CÃ©nac,"Named after the wife of the previous owner, this top cuvÃ©e from ChÃ¢teau de CÃ©nac is powered by its structure and dark tannins. The rich black berries and plums are still working through the dense texture. It's a complex wine, still showing its wood aging. Drink from 2017."
Argentina,85.0,60.0,Mendoza,Cicchitti,"Gritty aromas of asphalt, herbs, tomato and plum make for a tough opening. This is syrupy and grabby on the palate, with creamy berry and cooked brown-sugar flavors. A sinewy finish tastes medicinal and a touch weedy."
US,86.0,50.0,Central Coast,Clos La Chance,"This blend, based on Cabernet, is soft in structure, with easily accessible blackberry jam, sugared herb tea, red licorice and oak flavors."
Italy,89.0,30.0,Toscana,Caparzo,"Made with Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this opens with aromas of violet, cedar, and underbrush. The medium-bodied palate delivers red currant, black pepper and anise alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,93.0,70.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Reynvaan Family Vineyards,"This wine comes from the winery's plantings in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, a relatively unexplored region of the valley. Brooding aromas of ember, black and green olive, flower and earth lead to exceptionally pure-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It brings a compelling mouthfeel and sense of balance."
US,88.0,33.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Helix by Reininger,"This limited-production Viognier reflects the ripeness of the 2012 vintage. Immediately appealing, it coats the tongue with thick, peachy/tropical fruit flavors. A hint of saline cracker comes through as well. It's front-loaded, fruit-driven, and drinking at its prime."
US,90.0,155.0,Napa Valley,Hestan,"This wine has a classic personality: round and soft in tannin, with a chalkiness lurking behind herbal tobacco leaf, tomato, cedar and rose notes. Full-bodied, it doesn't hold back on ripeness but displays more savory character than fruit."
Spain,84.0,12.0,Navarra,Otazu,"This Merlot-based rosÃ© smells cheesy and not all that fruity. Chunky and obtuse on the palate, this tastes of generic citrus and berry fruits. An adequate finish is par for the course."
US,87.0,27.0,Santa Barbara County,Jaffurs,"A good everyday Syrah. It doesn't show the richness of the single-vineyard bottlings, but it's nice and dry, with berry, cherry, grilled meat, pepper and oak flavors."
Italy,88.0,28.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Codice Citra,"Blue flower, baking spice, sun baked earth and mature berry aromas come together on this solid red. The enjoyable, medium-bodied palate offers red plum, raspberry and a hint of cinnamon framed in supple polished tannins."
France,87.0,15.0,Vin de Pays des Maures,Domaine d'Astros,"Close to Saint-Tropez the vineyards of the Massif des Maures have produced an attractively fruity wine that has an unusual blending including the rare Caladoc grape. Raspberry fruits are right up front, giving a bright, ripe character."
US,90.0,72.0,Russian River Valley,Donum,"Shows its California origins in very ripe, lush and soft flavors of raspberries and cherries, creamy chocolate frosting and red currants. Plenty of oak adds wood spice and toast. A big, generous wine, flashy and incredibly rich, if lacking a bit in subtlety. Drink soon."
US,86.0,16.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Canoe Ridge,"Plum, spice and sweet herb aromas lead to rounded blue-fruit flavors surrounded by dry, astringent tannins that are unyielding."
US,93.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),K Vintners,"Mostly Grenache (88%) along with Syrah from River Rock and Northridge vineyards respectively, this wine is notably pale in color. The aromas of dried brown stems, white pepper, clove, tangerine peel, plum, fresh flowers and pomegranate are expressive. The elegant flavors display delicacy and complexity, while showing exceptional polish and balance. It's all about subtlety and nuance."
US,90.0,75.0,Carneros,ZD,"Mid-weight and balanced in flavor and texture, this reserve-tier wine combines pungent jasmine aromas with flavors of crunchy green apple and Meyer lemon. The finish shows a toasty oak note, layered in a touch of salt."
France,85.0,30.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,ChÃ¢teau de Beauregard,"This open, fruity wine is ready to drink. It offers some spice as well as a light smattering of apple and toast flavors. The aftertaste is all about fruit and acidity."
US,93.0,75.0,Russian River Valley,Ramey,"Very little of this wine exists, sadly, given its gorgeous mix of mint, dried herb and feral, meaty notes. Despite its rustic flirtatiousness, it allows for floral aromas to accent the expansive palate, revealing hints of white pepper, citrus and smoked meat."
US,88.0,65.0,Sonoma County,Pride Mountain,"The Napa-Sonoma winery, straddled across two counties, has added 12% Cabernet Sauvignon to the Cab Franc in this wine. The result is sizable in ripe, blueberry and blackberry fruit, soft tannins and a finish of dark chocolate. Void of any of the variety's signature herbaceous signature, it could easily be mistaken for Cabernet Sauvignon."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Navarra,Ochoa,"Hefty and rubbery on the bouquet, with black-fruit aromas and some dustiness. The palate is fresh feeling, with full acidity and a mildly stretched set of lively berry and roasted flavors. Comes up a bit short and hollow on the finish, but good all totaled."
US,88.0,25.0,Arroyo Seco,J. Lohr,"Very rich, oaky and acidic, showing the crisp, minerally profile that usually marks white wines from this Monterey appellation. The flavors veer toward lemons, limes and Asian pears. Drink this drily elegant Chardonnay now."
France,85.0,15.0,Beaujolais,Paul Beaudet,"Sweet cherry and raspberry flavors, with soft tannins. The acidity melds into the ripe fruits, in a wine that is rounded and ready to drink."
US,90.0,16.0,Lake County,Bonterra,"This is a dessert wine, and a very pleasurable one. It's sweet but not too sweet, and very high acidity provides crisp balance to the pineapple, peach, honeysuckle, vanilla and spice flavors. The official sugar reading is 7.5%, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 9%. Great with a fruit tart, sorbet or Key lime pie."
Italy,90.0,46.0,Alto Adige,Elena Walch,"This 100% Lagrein offers aromas of cassis, leather and baking spice. The robust palate delivers blackberry, vanilla and a sprinkling of cocoa alongside ripe firm tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,86.0,32.0,Santa Barbara County,JCR,"Rusty pink in color, this bottling shows somewhat sour aromas of red plum, turned earth, orange rind and tart raspberry. The palate offers dried cherry and more soil, but is missing the texture and acidity of many modern rosÃ©s."
US,91.0,42.0,Sonoma Mountain,Belden Barns,"Thick on the nose in black pepper and garrigue, this wine is velvety in layers of berry and cherry, with a hearty tobacco chaser. Concentrated and duly ripe, it brightens in the glass to show compelling bursts of white pepper and violet."
US,88.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mercer,"The top cuvÃ©e from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence."
US,85.0,18.0,Rogue Valley,Valley View,"This is overtaken with unripe flavors of tomato and underbrush. There's little suggestion of fresh fruit. Aged 14 months in one-use French oak, it finishes quickly with earthy tannins."
US,88.0,30.0,Carneros,Luke Donald,"Big, ripe waves of baked apple, pear and pineapple play on the palate in this rich wine, measured by a moderate helping of acidity. Quince and lime play supportive roles."
US,89.0,60.0,Paso Robles,Clavo Cellars,"This is a savory and tasty wine, with smoke, red cherries and bacon fat on the nose. The mouthfeel is dense, with rich flavors of black cherries, licorice and dark chocolate offering layers of complexity, rounded out by the right amount of tannins and acidity."
France,86.0,21.0,Morgon,Terroirs et Talents,"Structured and dense, the wine is dominated by its tannins. With a dry core and only the hints of real fruitiness, it is likely to take a while to develop. Final acidity provides hints of a fruitier future. Drink from 2018."
US,89.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Amalie Robert,"At five years old, this is soft and supple, with well-integrated plum, cherry, spice and cola components. It's smooth and seamless and should be drunk soon."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Greco di Tufo,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Thanks to its large case production, this crisp Greco di Tufo should be easy to locate at your local wine store or supermarket. It offers a wonderful introduction to southern Italian, volcanic soil winemaking thanks to drying mineral tones, pear and apple."
Spain,91.0,46.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with grabby black cherry and blackberry flavors along with toasty, dark shadings. Finishes firm, with a touch of black olive and herbs. The best MC to date; drink now through 2017."
US,91.0,70.0,Chehalem Mountains,Scott Paul,"Journaux, the winery notes, is an old Burgundian term for the amount of land a person could plow by horse in a single day. The Azana vineyard is the source for the fruit, and is about four journaux in size. It brings flavors of strawberry candy, raspberry soda, and a bit of Dr Pepper. At first a forward, fruity, charming wine, it turns brambly and herbal in the well-balanced finish."
US,87.0,46.0,Temecula Valley,Leoness,"Lots of raisins, prunes and heavy baking spice show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling, as well as hints of black pepper and shredded asphalt. Exotic figs and prunes also make an appearance on the palate, which is framed by a decent tannic grip."
France,94.0,115.0,Champagne,Pol Roger,"From the great 2002 vintage, this is a beautifully structured wine, packed with a fine texture of red berries, intense acidity as well as richness. Intense, complex wine that could well age."
US,86.0,16.0,Napa Valley,Napa Cellars,"Waxy apple opens the nose before this tame stainless-steel aged white builds flavors of pear and vanilla extract amid a medium-bodied frame. More pear, with a wrapping of gingery spice, is featured on the finish."
US,88.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Helix by Reininger,"Pomatia is an almost mythical creation?like one of those half man, half beast monsters from ancient times. The blend is not that unusual, but the results might be likened to a sculpture by Picasso?a piece of wood here, an old newspaper there, and a bicycle seat for a head. Not to disparage the wine?it's flavorful and full-bodied, but a puzzler. Funkadelic meets Clapton? Cherries and earth, tannin and tea."
US,88.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),J. Bookwalter,"This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah, with a core of blueberry and cocoa. It's super-smooth and quite easy to sip and enjoy. But apart from that, and the seductive coffee/mocha flavors that run rampant through the finish, it shows little of the depth and complexity that Washington Cabernet can display. Drink 2017??019."
US,86.0,39.0,Virginia,Barrel Oak,"Slightly shy aromas of spiced pastry, wild berry and lilac lead into the full-bodied palate. Even with its high level of strapping tannins this remains succulent, with a warm, structured finish."
US,85.0,13.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Hyatt,"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, it's light in style with notes of red currant, herbs and olive with little apparent oak influence. A straight-forward easy quaffer."
Spain,93.0,52.0,Bierzo,Pittacum,"Ripe, loamy, rooty aromas of blackberry, cedar and marzipan are a fine draw. This is firm and juicy, with a solid foundation of acidity and integrated tannins. Robust flavors of black fruits and fig finish tight, fresh and proportional. This is good now but still evolving; drink through 2020."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Sicilia,Roberto Cipresso,"Vintner Roberto Cipresso presents a dense and rich blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from Sicily with ripe aromas of prune, blackberry and black pepper. The wine is dark and thick in the mouth and would pair with grilled steak."
France,87.0,14.0,Bergerac Sec,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"A richly opulent blend of Sauvignon Blanc and SÃ©millon. It is rich, almost too rich due to its low acidity, but with some attractive melon, green plum and peach fruits. The spice from wood adds interest."
US,86.0,25.0,Sonoma Valley,Buena Vista,"This highly concentrated, richly ripe red explores notions of plum, black cherry and tobacco. It finishes with a mildness of dried herb."
US,83.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Curtis,"Annoyingly sweet, like chilled orange and lemon tea sweetened white sugar. There's a nice edge of acidity, and lots of people will like it. But still, it isn't really a dry table wine."
US,83.0,10.0,El Dorado,Duarte Georgetown,"Dark in color, this rosÃ© made from Grenache grapes is quite sour and a little off-balance, though the bottle it comes in is very pretty."
US,85.0,14.0,Mendocino County,Bonterra,"Here's an easy-drinking, inexpensive rosÃ© that's perfect for summer occasions. Made from an unusual blend of Sangiovese, Zinfandel, Carignan and Grenache, it's dryish, crisp and clean, with berry and spice flavors."
US,81.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,Hauer of the Dauen,Some green manure notes and more general barnyard aromas provide aromatic interest but can?t make up for excessively tart cherry fruit and an oddly cloying finish
Italy,89.0,26.0,Lugana,Marangona,"Aromas of pressed white flower and orchard fruit waft from the glass. On the palate, a nutty note of toasted hazelnut and a mineral vein add depth to the dried apricot, baked yellow peach and citrus flavors. Enjoy soon."
France,82.0,8.0,Vin Mousseux,Royal Muscato,"There is a curious imbalance here between Muscat's natural honey and very insistent acidity. The result is a wine that wants to be fresh, sweet and fruity, but doesn't fully succeed."
France,85.0,49.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Valade,"Barrel aged for 12 months, this 95% Merlot wine (with a dash of Cabernet Franc) is very dominated by its wood. That gives it a seriously toasty character that dominates the fruit. At five years old, it should be more balanced."
US,88.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cor Cellars,"This off-dry (11.5% alcohol) Riesling is a fruit-driven wine, with a tangy sweet/tart mouthfeel reminiscent of Vouvray. Meyer lemon, apricot, lime and candied pineapple flavors pile on. There's plenty of natural acid to cut through the sweetness."
US,91.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Limerick Lane,"A more modest varietal wine than some of the producer's block-specific bottlings, it nonetheless stuns in its combination of blackberry crumble, dark chocolate and sanguine meatiness. The texture is luxuriously smooth and lasting."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Buty,"Light dried orange peel, herb and candlewax aromas lead to broad, medium-bodied fruit flavors in this white. It's enjoyable despite the muted aromatic expression."
US,91.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Watermill,"The instantly recognizable label, sporting a bright green praying mantis on a plain brown background, is a quirky choice for a fine, estate-grown reserve. The fruit reaches blackberry concentration, with stiff, ripe tannins swathed in dark chocolate. Hints of earth and stem fade out through a lingering finish. It's already drinking well but could be cellared until 2019."
France,82.0,8.0,Languedoc,Val d'Orbieu,"Cherry, plum and earth aromas lead into a tart, lean palate that struggles to offer more than a modicum of cherry and cassis flavors. The finish is sweet and spicy, which makes for an odd, not terribly appealing combination."
US,90.0,25.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"Split pea and earthy mushroom give way to sparkling acidity and a bright, flush taste of lemon and grapefruit in this succulent white, low in oak imprint. This is a food-friendly wine that can stand on its own, complex and layered with a citrus-squeezed finish."
France,93.0,110.0,Saint-Ãmilion,Vieux ChÃ¢teau Mazerat,"Very intense wine, packed with dark tannins, solid and powerful. It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated."
Italy,82.0,12.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,Remo Farina,"The ripasso technique consists of passing the already completed ?normal??Valpolicella back over the lees of the Amarone in the spring after vinification of the latter is complete. This results in a minor refermentation, adding extra alcohol and flavor. If the latter occurred in this particular version, it is not very evident. There is a modest amount of dry fruit present, but the mouth-searing acids and mouth-drying tannins hurt this wine."
US,83.0,17.0,Napa Valley,Dominican Oaks,"Modest flavors of peaches and limes characterize this bone-dry Chardonnay. It's clean, crisp in acidity, but too light to earn a better score."
Spain,88.0,24.0,Rioja,El Coto,"An opening of spice, toasted fruit, leather and lemon peel is attractive in the traditional sense. Medium bodied, with tangy red-cherry flavors up front and some citrus in the rear. Finishes light and fresh, with touches of vanilla and fresh-chopped dill. Very drinkable if you like a more classic-style Rioja."
Italy,86.0,18.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,La Farra,"A soft note of peach nectar or apricot gives this wine rounder, more generous appeal. Most Prosecco Superiore is executed in an Extra Dry style which means the sparkler has just enough sugar to feel plush and creamy."
Italy,85.0,13.0,Prosecco del Veneto,Martini & Rossi,"Crisp and fragrant, here is a Prosecco with direct aromas of peach, honey and orange blossom. Martini & Rossi delivers a clean sparkler that has hints of aromatic fruit on the close."
US,86.0,11.0,California,Barefoot Bubbly,"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price."
US,83.0,38.0,Napa Valley,Hendry,"There's a closed-off and slightly bitter edge to this wine, a blend of 35% Petit Verdot, 25% Malbec, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. A weedy, herbal streak is most prominent throughout."
France,87.0,20.0,Bourgogne Hautes CÃ´tes de Nuits,Nuiton-Beaunoy,"Structured and fruity, this is a wine that shows the delicate perfumed character of the Hautes CÃ´tes. The wine has bright raspberry fruits, balanced acidity and just the right amount of structure for aging for a year."
US,93.0,53.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"A new entry in the Dusted Valley lineup, this offering is co-fermented with Viognier and includes a small amount of Petite Sirah as well. It shows real depth and power, a concentrated explosion of boysenberry and black cherry fruit, annotated with clove and anise. A delicious underpinning of mineral and graphite anchor the lengthy finish."
US,91.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"A big, ripe, voluptuous Zinfandel, packed with flavor. The deliciousness factor of blackberries, cherries, anise and dark chocolate comes at the cost of high alcohol, which limits the wine's elegance but makes it super-drinkable with the richest barbecue imaginable."
Spain,80.0,13.0,Cava,Conde de Subirats,"Scattered, dusty, yeasty aromas of mustard and apple are less than welcoming. This feels choppy and strained, with vanilla and white-fruit flavors."
Italy,87.0,10.0,Sicilia,Feudo Arancio,"This opens with aromas of black cherry, chocolate, prune and blackberry jam. Freshness and subtle softness picks up on the rear of the wine."
Spain,84.0,15.0,Rueda,Telmo RodrÃ­guez,"Lemon, lime and straw aromas are fresh but also a little stalky. Spritz and then an oily afternote define the feel, while flavors of white fruits taste pithy and a touch green and herbaceous."
US,87.0,49.0,Dundee Hills,Winter's Hill,"Block 8 is pure WÃ¤denswil clone. This is exceptionally aromatic, with bramble and underbrush prominent. Light strawberry fruit comes up with hints of sassafras and drying tannins. It's an interesting component but would be even better in a blend."
US,89.0,27.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"Earthy and feral, this Pinot from the Sonoma County sparkling wine house of Gloria Ferrer shows the producer's attention to detail with still wines. With soft layers of balanced wild strawberry, cedar and distinctive brambly spice, it'll serve perfectly alongside roast duck."
US,96.0,400.0,Stags Leap District,Clos du Val,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was aged for 26 months in 50% new French oak. The mouthfeel is soft and luxurious. This wine was bottled only in magnums, and it's gorgeous and delicious, with classic blackberry, cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. Despite its full body, the wine has an elegant silkiness that's light and feathery. This is clearly the greatest Cabernet Clos du Val has ever produced. Drink now??026."
US,86.0,38.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Sunstone,"The exceptional sweetness of this dessert wine goes a long way to mask its flaws. Once the palate has enjoyed the waves of honey, caramel and chocolate, it notices that the actual grape flavors of blackberries are a bit weak and finish fast. Would benefit enormously from greater concentration of fruit."
Australia,85.0,10.0,South Eastern Australia,Salena Estate,"Melon and pear notes provide the flesh, while a citrusy element provides the backbone of this medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's round without being flabby, ending on a refreshing, citrusy note. Drink now."
US,91.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),J. Bookwalter,"This is 96% Cabernet Sauvignon, with an addition of Syrah. Fully ripe, bold and assertive, this high-octane wine holds its alcohol well. Muscular and powerful, it has black cherry and cassis flavors that saturated with baking spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee notes. This is well supported by acids and is matched to perfectly ripe tannins."
US,84.0,15.0,California,Foppiano,"Despite the fancy Lot designation, this is a simple Petite Sirah. It's soft and lush in licorice and blackberry jam flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Fine for drinking now with burgers, ribs, Mexican fare."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Trabucchi d'Illasi,"Aged 15 months in French oak, this Valpolicella blend (with large components of Corvina and Corvinone grapes) delivers earthy aromas and a touch of wild mushroom beyond its dark fruit and spicy nuances."
France,88.0,13.0,Vin de Table Francais,Domaine de la Tour BoisÃ©e,"A complex blend of 23 varieties, from a Languedoc vineyard originally planted in 1905. This has firm, rustic character, with dry tannins, dense black fruit and fresh, juicy acidity. There is a softness at the end, giving black currant acidity to finish."
US,91.0,28.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Grassini,"Fresh and stony on the nose, this bottling from one of the region's leading properties shows crisp lime and grapefruit pith aromas. The palate is edged with tart yellow grapefruit yet also offers warmer tones of nectarine-like fruit. Refreshing acidity and chalky grip carry deep into the finish."
US,83.0,45.0,Sonoma Valley,Rancho Zabaco,"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced."
Italy,86.0,19.0,ValtÃ¨nesi,Costaripa,"This opens with subtle aromas of white spring flower, red berry and a whiff of toast that carry over to the rather lean palate along with notes of sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of oak. It closes on a bitter-almond note."
US,86.0,25.0,Green Valley,Ron Rubin,"From a cool-climate pocket within the larger Russian River Valley where even sparkling wine grapes thrive, this Pinot is muted somewhat, its flavors darker and oakier than expected, earthy yet shy in spice"
US,86.0,20.0,Arroyo Seco,Wente,"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows barrel-inspired vanilla and buttered toast flavors that enrich the pineapples and apples. A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory."
US,91.0,50.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Thomas Fogarty,"One of the best Malbecs on the market. It's perfect for drinking now despite big tannins. Shows vast, deep blackberry, blueberry, dark chocolate, currant and anise flavors, with a long, spicy finish. Grill up a steak and pop the cork."
US,94.0,42.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Hitching Post,"Has this vineyard ever produced anything less than a spectacular Pinot Noir? Hitching Post's '06 showcases its exotic spiciness and the way its power is modulated with an elegant structure. Cloves, nutmeg, allspice and white pepper are just a few of the spices that tantalize the cherry, orange and cola flavors. The wine feels wonderful in the mouth, rich and long-lasting. Ageable, too, with a window extending beyond 2012."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Alto Adige,Produttori Colterenzio,"This is a rare example of a successful wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc. The fruit comes from the Lafoa vineyard in Cornaiano. Half the wine has new oak barrel fermentation, the other was kept in stainless steel, cutting the wood flavors to an elegant balance with the floral and mineral flavors."
US,90.0,45.0,Alexander Valley,Artesa,"There's a lot to like in this dense and impactful wine, a mix of softly layered black plum and raspberry with a powerful bouquet of violet. Medium bodied, it finishes fresh and pillowy."
France,88.0,25.0,Alsace,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg,"This is a ripe, delicately tropical and fruity wine with rich texture. It is smooth, rounded on the palate, but accompanied by a shot of acidity. The lemon aftertaste hints at a more steely character."
US,86.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Spell,"From a cool site near the town of Graton, this is a highly concentrated, slightly cloudy wine with strong Gravenstein apple and lemon-lime aromas. Wild anise flavors season the rich, bold palate, but the finish seems diluted."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra,"This Barbera's black cherry, blackberry and clove aromas segue to its simple palate. Supple tannins and brisk acidity lend support. Drink through 2019."
France,90.0,68.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019."
US,86.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Manzoni,"The trick with growing Syrah in the Highlands is hitting the sweet spot between ripeness and its opposite. This bottling certainly achieves very fruity black currant, dark chocolate, pepper and root beer flavors that are delicious. It has a sharpness throughout that detracts from the lush feeling, but that sharpness may go away with some time in the bottle."
US,86.0,15.0,Lodi,Campus Oaks,"It tastes lush, slightly sweet and full-on fruity, but has a lavish oak overlay. The aromas are sweet cherries and maple syrup, the fruit flavors come out as just-crushed grapes and cherries sprinkled with the brown sugar of new oak. Not heavy in texture and not as full-bodied as the flavors would make you think."
Italy,83.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,La Porta di Vertine,"This wine shows both sweet and bitter sensations that include ripe fruit aromas along with rustic farmyard notes. The palate shows overripe plum and vanilla extract framed by green, bitter tannins."
US,81.0,14.0,California,Cambridge & Sunset,"This lean wine has light melon and dried herb aromas, an almost neutral flavor profile and short finish."
Spain,92.0,16.0,Jerez,Hidalgo,"Licorice city on the nose, so much so that it smells like the real thing. In the mouth, it is thick as they come. Flavors of maple, white raisins and milk chocolate are in your face and delicious. Expect a syrupy wine that requires a knife to cut through. Still, it's a wonderful reflection of this generous, sweet-leaning grape."
US,85.0,16.0,Finger Lakes,Fulkerson,"). Savory on the nose with scents of pressed apple and honey comb, this fairly dry Riesling is surprisingly round and rich on the palate with a lush, floral profile balanced by hints of wax and lanolin and a tart lime juice acidity."
US,92.0,20.0,Anderson Valley,Handley,"Crisp and very floral, this is a beautiful showcase of Anderson Valley's cool climate and commitment to Alsatian varieties. There's a great depth of flavor here?fig, grapefruit, lime and orange peel?not to mention tremendous minerality. This is a wine that can be sipped all day long or enjoyed with fish, poultry or an onion tart."
US,87.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Van Duzer,"This is lively and tart, suggesting citrus rind, grapefruit and juniper berries. There's a snap to the acidity and some bitterness in the finishing flavors."
France,93.0,45.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau La Lagune,"The freshness of 2004 is the hallmark of this deliciously ripe but elegant wine. It is packed with juicy red berry fruits, giving richness but vibrant acidity."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,MontgÃ³,"Lightly oxidized aromas of apple and peach are waxy and on the cusp of being stale. In the mouth, however, this is stony and citric, with orange and lemon flavors. Finishing acidity and stoniness cut through this wine's older, heftier qualities. Drink now."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Barbaresco,Cascina delle Rose,"Ripe black-skinned berry, violet, leather and baking spice aromas emerge in the glass. The polished, juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, mint and pipe tobacco alongside lithe tannins. Drink through 2023."
US,85.0,20.0,Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma,Martin Ray,"A bit green and minty, with a sharp mouthfeel that lacks elegance and richness. However, there are some good blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, elaborated with oak."
US,88.0,19.0,Santa Barbara County,Fess Parker,"This easy-drinking blend of 86% Viognier, 8% Roussanne, 3% Marsanne and 3% Grenache Blanc?featuring a sailboat painting by Santa Barbara artist Chris Potter?offers aromas of flambÃ©ed bananas and toasted coconut on the nose. The palate shows grapefruit pith and the warmth of browned pears and seared red apples, seasoned with a nice sparkle of acidity."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Valpolicella Superiore,Santi,"Aromas of black plum, vanilla and a whiff underbrush lead the nose. Made with 80% Corvina, 10% Corvinone and 10% Rondinella, the light-bodied palate shows blackberry jam, clove and a hint of cocoa alongside loose-knit tannins. Drink soon."
Italy,87.0,60.0,Barbaresco,Carlo Giacosa,"Sour berry, coconut and camphor aromas lead the way while the firm palate offers toast, vanilla, espresso and chocolate-covered cherry flavors. Grainy tannins grip the finish."
Italy,89.0,28.0,Friuli Isonzo,Lis Neris,"Fermented in oak barrels, this has aromas that recall white flower, toasted oak, baked pear and dried apricot. The palate offers butterscotch and mature Golden Delicious apple alongside fresh acidity. Toasted hazelnut signals the finish."
Argentina,87.0,25.0,Mendoza,ZaHa,Herbal blueberry aromas blend with green and blue-fruit tones on the nose. The palate is disjointed in minty flavors of oak and berry fruits that finish thick.
Italy,89.0,23.0,Irpinia,Feudi di San Gregorio,"Enticing aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry, chopped herb and clove lead the nose while the vibrant palate offers wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice and a hint of ground pepper. Polished tannins support the savory flavors."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Collelceto,"Warm spice and dark fruit tones with cured meat, bresaola, licorice, black pepper, leather and tobacco define this expression. The wine is plush rich, structured and firm."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Morellino di Scansano,Colle Spinello,"This opens with aromas that recall mature plum, resin and nail polish. The palate offers fleshy blackberry, nutmeg, anise and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. A subtle warmth of alcohol marks the close."
Italy,91.0,44.0,Toscana,Marchesi Torrigiani,"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet, this shows weight on the palate, and it offers velvety tannins and bright fruit and spicy flavors. The aromatic delivery is immediate and clean."
US,87.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"The Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest is consistently the most broadly fruity, round and oaky wine in the lineup (outside of the much pricier reserve). Apple, pear and peach fruit dominates, and the sometimes too-present, tarted up flavors of butter and vanilla have been brought back into better proportion in this 2006 bottling. Sure to be a popular style, this is one of the best vintages in the past five years."
US,92.0,29.0,Red Hills Lake County,Sol Rouge,"More flavorful than the rather light color might indicate, this sophisticated wine has wonderful, complex aromas like leather, tea and chocolate. Vibrant flavors of raspberry and pomegranate partner with an appetizingly dry and slightly tannic texture. It is medium to full bodied."
US,93.0,62.0,Mt. Harlan,Calera,"The nose of this bottling is extremely focused on black raspberry and grapeseed, and its snappy dark fruit is tempered with agebrush, lavender and mace aromas. Firm and upright tannins frame the palate, where dark cranberry and clove flavors combine for layers of energy and depth."
Argentina,89.0,15.0,Cafayate,Trapiche,"Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to TorrontÃ©s, while green herb and lime notes stir things up."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Parducci,"Good price for a deliciously drinkable Pinot Noir. It's silky and a little sweet in raspberries, brown sugar and bacon flavors. Easy to drink and at this price, it can be your house Pinot."
France,84.0,15.0,Coteaux du Giennois,Clement et Florian Berthier,"While the wine is ripe, it does have a barnyard aroma that needs to blow away before it is ready to drink. The aroma comes with firm, dry tannins and a ripe berry fruits that are just beginning to develop. Drink from 2017."
Spain,90.0,15.0,Jerez,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,"With a nose of toffee, dried apricot, cocoa powder and rancio, this is classic off-dry amontillado. It feels fresh and active, then tastes rich and moderately sweet, with flavors of hazelnut, caramel, toasted banana, orange and spice. Nutty and smooth on the finish."
Italy,83.0,20.0,Morellino di Scansano,Poggio Lungo,"Jammy notes of strawberry and raspberry preserves open the nose of this overripe Morellino di Scansano. The wine is dark and concentrated but all that mature fruit leaves a raw, chewy sensation on the finish."
Italy,85.0,12.0,Sicilia,Feudo Disisa,"Grillo is a native grape of southern Italy and this bright expression of the variety delivers a creamy, fatty texture and melon, apricot and Golden Delicious apple notes."
Argentina,88.0,10.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout."
Italy,89.0,77.0,Barbaresco,Pio Cesare,"Menthol, violet, exotic spice and tobacco aromas take center stage in this wine. The firm palate shows red cherry, licorice and crushed herb flavors set against a backdrop of close-grained, grippy tannins."
US,90.0,24.0,Washington,Coeur d'Alene,"Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel."
US,85.0,18.0,North Coast,Ruby Red,"This tastes sweet and clean, with mango, peach and orange flavors that are brightened with zesty acidity."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Vittoria,Judeka,"This straightforward red offers aromas and flavors of white rose, red cherry, raspberry and a note of black pepper. Round, smooth tannins and fresh acidity provide the easy drinking framework. Enjoy now."
US,100.0,80.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins. It's all in proportion and a fine reflection of the steely vintage. As it opens gracefully you discover that it is a stunningly refined Frog, quite possibly the best ever; powerful and distinctive, but also elegant, feminine."
France,89.0,16.0,Alsace,Paul Blanck,"Some yeast notes still play on the nose. The palate has some zesty freshness that comprises lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. The palate is light and fresh; the body is light with a dry but lasting lemony finish."
US,86.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Rotta,"Fresh-squeezed olallieberries, concentrated lilacs, plum skin and a light pepper aroma show on this wine's dense nose. The palate is lighter in flavor yet dense in texture, with strong tannins framing the fresh boysenberry fruit."
US,81.0,25.0,California,Black Box,"Semi-sweet and tasting like cherry-flavored cough medicine, this Merlot leaves a lot to be desired. But it's serviceable."
US,90.0,60.0,Dundee Hills,Lange,"Nice black cherry and black currant fruit flavors are wrapped in a casing of stone and earth. This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy. A pleasing streak of truffle elevates the finish."
US,90.0,30.0,Sonoma County,Roth,"Several varieties figure into this blend, from 26% Zinfandel and 21% Syrah to smaller amounts of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big and powerful in smoky leather and black currant, it offers a rich softness on the palate, with a tightly wound savory, peppery aspect to the finish."
US,89.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tulpen,"This is a marked departure from previous vintages. Tight and earthy, with the accent on peppery, herbal flavors rather than sweet fruit, it's the most Bordeaux-like wine in the 2008 portfolio from Tulpen."
US,88.0,90.0,Atlas Peak,Rombauer,"A 100% varietal wine from one vineyard, this wine opens in cinnamon stick and blackberry jam, leading the way to chocolatey leather on the palate offset by tingling acidity. Currant, blueberry and cedar also make appearances atop a full-body and lengthy, concentrated finish."
US,90.0,12.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"This is at the sweetest edge of off dry (alcohol at 9%, residual sugar 5.1%) and it is loaded with citrus fruit?especially ripe orange?that keeps it lively and refreshing. A well-made, full-bodied Riesling that lingers gracefully through the finish, with a streak of lemon tea."
Spain,91.0,17.0,Rioja,Bodegas Landaluce,"Fresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around. This fruit-forward Crianza is mouth-filling and borders on lush. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry, pepper and spice finish solid as a rock, with length and a confirming sense of quality."
US,91.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Rutherford Ranch,"Dusty Mexican chocolate meets black plum, cherry and pomegranate in this light-bodied, rounded wine that's juicy and delicious. It's well balanced and approachable now, so drink up."
US,86.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,Rodney Strong,"This is an orange citrus-tinged wine, fully layered and weighty in apple and pear. Popcorn, corn nuts and toasted oak provide the warmth and breadth of aroma and flavor. This wine is ready for crab cakes."
US,93.0,55.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Arista,"The oak sticks out now in the form of toast and sweet wood sap, but that's because it hasn't been integrated into this fine young wine. Give it 3?? years to come around, by which time the barrel influence will equalize with the ripe raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola and red currants. Could be quite special around 2015."
US,88.0,36.0,Paso Robles,Moxy,"This wine shows somewhat generic black and purple-fruit aromas, with a hint of purple flowers as well. The palate picks up the pace with brown sugar, pork fat, juicy boysenberry fruit and touches of white pepper, violet and fennel."
Italy,90.0,26.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Corte dei Venti,"This earthy Brunello leads with aromas of underbrush, mushroom, bay leaf, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. The palate offers juicy black cherry and ripe raspberry punctuated with cinnamon-spice, vanilla, mocha and licorice alongside smoothed but fleeting tannins. It's nicely crafted and boasts decent freshness for the vintage."
US,90.0,120.0,Sonoma County,Buena Vista,"This intensely ripe wine is made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot. Its waxy cherry, currant and blueberry flavers are laced wtih milk chocolate and smoky oak richness, a dash of high-toned acidity sparking on the finish."
US,94.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Sojourn,"In this silky and seductive wine, integrated oak and tannin wrap around lilting waves of earth and rose petal, providing plenty of sensory intrigue. From several vineyards, including Wohler, it shines a light on the subtleties that can be coaxed from the appellation, along with a spectacular exuberance."
US,88.0,40.0,El Dorado,Donkey & Goat,"Savory as a weathered leather chair, this vintage of Fenaughty is all spice, smoke and meat, smooth and structured, and remarkably low in alcohol, a feat that's probably pretty challenging to achieve in the Foothills. The firm tannins should keep this fine specimen going for a while in the cellar."
Italy,95.0,450.0,Barbaresco,Gaja,"Red berry, aromatic herb, pressed violet and dark spice aromas meld together in the glass. Firmly structured, the palate boasts intensity and energy, offering dark cherry, licorice and mint set against a backbone of fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced but young so give this time to fully develop. Drink 2020??032."
US,92.0,38.0,Sonoma Valley,Saxon Brown,"This wine has ripe black cherry flavors, great acidity and firm tannins that keep it lively enough to balance the fruity richness. Full bodied, broad in mouthfeel, but with a background tanginess, it is well balanced and keeps encouraging another sip."
US,91.0,72.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Alleromb,"Two-thirds Grenache and one-third Syrah, this wine has intriguing aromas of white pepper, earthy funk, garrigue and berry. It's full bodied with the oak (33% new French) dialed back, putting the focus on the rich red and black fruit flavors."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Fiano di Avellino,Antonio Caggiano,"This is a luminous and powerful Fiano di Avellino with a very elegant and linear quality that sets it apart. You'll get herbs, cantaloupe and fresh lime. It performs well in the mouth thanks to its thick, creamy texture and boosting alcohol. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers."
US,94.0,98.0,St. Helena,Corison,"This winery has had a reputation for making Cabs in a leaner, more ageworthy style, but that is no longer true, to judge by this '05. It's as ripe and fruity as anything out there, and immediately drinkable for its beautiful blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. Still, the tannins are considerable, and the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best now and through 2013, at the least."
US,92.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Kanzler,"Concentrated, delicious fruit flavors and subtle spiciness make a great combination in this harmonious and full-bodied wine. There is no obvious oak character, but it tastes like a gently barrel-fermented wine that developed hints of cream, nutmeg and honey along with a river of ripe pear and peach."
Spain,85.0,90.0,Calatayud,Lamin,"Heavy oak is a front-row theme throughout this tannic, extracted, black-tinted Garnacha. Hot fudge sundae and sawmill aromas lead to a palate that's as tannic as sandpaper. Its charred, heavily oaked flavors finish chocolaty, with a lasting and overbearing taste of clove, lacking balance and clarity of fruit."
US,89.0,30.0,Temecula Valley,Callaway,"Honey, jasmine, salted nectarine, yellow melon and plumeria flowers pop on the nose of this bottling that indicates Roussanne may do well in Temecula. There's solid yellow-grapefruit-pith grip to the palate, a touch of tart tangerine, slate minerality and some botanical elements. It's bright and tense for an often oily, easily over-ripened grape."
US,88.0,14.0,Oregon,Rainstorm,"Supple and seamless, this lightly spicy wine is a good all-purpose white. The clean, crisp fruit touches on kiwi, pear and a hint of green banana. Vinified in stainless steel, it's a refreshing wine that should be enjoyed soon."
France,86.0,56.0,Champagne,Jean Laurent,"This soft wine has strong red-berry flavors and a ripe, lightly tannic texture from the 100% Pinot Noir. It is fruity and ready to drink."
Spain,92.0,60.0,Rioja,CVNE,"After initial aromas of char, gritty leather, asphalt and tar fade, you get mature, herbal cherry and plum scents. This gran reserva is delivering light, racy, tangy flavors of raspberry and strawberry along with vanilla. On the finish, this is subtle, elegant and pure. Drink now through 2024."
US,84.0,19.0,California,One Hope,"With underlying pineapple and lime fruit, this wine is overoaked. It's all about buttered toast, caramel and butterscotch flavors, saved by crisp acidity."
France,93.0,190.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Margaux,"This fresh, crisp wine hovers attractively between crisp, herbal Sauvignon and riper yellow fruits. Touches of wood adds richness to this already-drinkable wine. Drink now or better, from 2017."
US,89.0,24.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Watermill,"This pure, full-bodied Merlot coats the palate with purple fruits and a creamy mix of mint, spice and vanilla. The herbal highlights are subtle and proportionate, and it's a very flavorful wine for the price."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Zolo,"Orange peel, green fruits and then not much else make for a standard nose. The palate is full-sized and melony, and so is the plump, sweet finish. There's size, tropical fruit and green banana all over this wine, but not much spine or structure. Drink now."
Australia,90.0,20.0,Barossa Valley,Charles Cimicky,"A strong effort from Cimicky, the 2008 Trumps displays ample complexity in its hints of chocolate, coffee, cedar, blueberries and baking spices, then puts all of that in a soft, creamy, mouthfilling package tinged with licorice on the finish. Drink now."
US,87.0,29.0,Napa Valley,Saddleback Cellars,"Made in the popular style, this has flavors of pineapple and orange jam, buttered toast and buttered popcorn. Its acidity and firm minerality save it from seeming sweet."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Sovana,Michele Ventura,"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is vinified in steel and bottle aged. It's young and fresh, boasting bright red cherry and raspberry sensations along with notes of freshly tilled earth."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Mano A Mano,"Smoky, oaky aromas rest on top of basic berry scents, with hints of leather and animal as the wine breathes out. This feels tight and juicy in the mouth, with pulling tannins. Oaked-up black-fruit flavors end with spice notes and a hint of chocolate."
US,91.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"A majority varietal, this wine also holds small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. These combine well with one another to exude notes of licorice, plum and black cherry. Right now, it ends with sprinklings of dried herb. Dense and tannic, it will soften with time, through 2020."
US,92.0,55.0,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Jada Vineyard & Winery,"Thick, concentrated, almost syrupy aromas of blueberry, fudge, espresso and a splash of crÃ¨me de menthe show on this attention-grabbing bottling of 61% Petit Verdot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and 18% Merlot. The palate is happily not as thick as expected, offering dark chocolate, minty licorice and espresso flavors, leaving a menthol zing on the tongue into the finish."
US,90.0,39.0,Napa County,Mumm CuvÃ©e Napa,"A majority of Pinot Noir is balanced by 40% Chardonnay. Nutty, rich and full figured, with a tenacity of stone fruit woven into the lengthy finish, this wine has moderate acidity, opting for a balance of concentration and weight."
US,84.0,17.0,Paso Robles,Slow Press,"Fairly shy aromas of crushed grapes and grape seeds show on the nose of this widely available wine. It's also quite reserved on the palate, offering just a touch of plum, grape and earth elements."
France,92.0,40.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,Les Vignerons de Tutiac,"Although it effectively disappeared from Bordeaux after phylloxera, Malbec hung on in Blaye on the north side of the Gironde Estuary. This wine, part of a single-parcel (lieu dit in French) single-varietal range, is richly structured and powerfully dense. It has great tannins and also bold ripe black fruits. Drink this concentrated wine from 2020."
Italy,90.0,60.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Cantina Zaccagnini,"This offers layers of toasted nut, chocolate, jammy black fruit and tobacco. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, with a good deal of richness and density to drive it forward over the palate."
US,84.0,18.0,Dry Creek Valley,Bedarra,"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay is simple and slightly sweet. It has flavors of oranges, pineapples and apricots, wrapped into a creamy texture."
US,88.0,85.0,Sonoma Coast,Hirsch,"Winemaker Ross Cobb, formerly with Williams Selyem and Flowers, did his best, but this Pinot tastes acidic and labored. It has lean flavors of strawberries and raspberries and new French oak. The wine isn't showing well now, seemingly a victim of the harsh vintage. Its future is problematic."
US,81.0,26.0,Santa Barbara County,Lucas & Lewellen,"Smells a bit musty and earthy, tastes overly sweet and sharp in acids, like raspberry jelly. Drink now."
US,93.0,52.0,Napa Valley,Olson Ogden,"This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak. But it's also fairly tannic. Very fine now, with a brief decant, and through 2013."
Canada,91.0,65.0,Okanagan Valley,Painted Rock,"This is a solid, complex, complete and evocative five-grape Bordeaux blend. It has distinctive characteristics reflective of the region's terroir. Threads of soy and balsamic run across deep cassis fruit. The stiff acidity has a citrus flavor, and details of clean fresh herb add further interest. It's a wine with a fine sense of detail, balance and length."
US,86.0,22.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Demetria,"It's not clear what the varietal blend is, but it tastes like a RhÃ´ne-style wine, and a simple one, at that. Soft and silky, it has raspberry, honey, toasted almond and cinnamon flavors."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Chianti Rufina,Travignoli,"Here's a bright, informal red that offers sour cherry, red berry and a light note of cooking spice. Lively acidity and soft, rather fleeting tannins give it an easy-drinking quality."
US,87.0,45.0,Napa Valley,ChÃ¢teau Potelle,"Impressive, but too sweet for comfort, despite great streamlining acidity that keeps the finish clean. Tastes like sugared orange tea and pineapple jam, with the buttered toast and caramel of oak. Earns extra points for minerality and structure."
US,86.0,36.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Talley,"Talley's basic estate Pinot can be good, and it can be ordinary. The '06 is pretty tannic and direct. It's a hard, tough wine that's not particularly lush, although it's clean and properly varietal. You'll find cherry and currant flavors that veer into raisins."
Italy,93.0,50.0,Valtellina Superiore,Arpepe,"Alpine herb, crushed stone, wild berry, pressed rose and a whiff of tar are some of the aromas you'll find on this wonderfully fragrant Nebbiolo. The racy elegant palate delivers succulent sour cherry, star anise, wild mint and a balsamic note while assertive but refined tannins and vibrant acidity provide ageworthy support. A vein of flinty mineral closes the finish. Drink 2018??028."
US,91.0,25.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Santa Barbara Winery,"Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate."
France,86.0,15.0,Vin de France,Vinadeis,"Soft and smooth, with a creamy mousse, this is red fruit-flavored wine. It has a crisp citrus background while being ripe and rounded up front. The wine, 100% Pinot Noir, is ready to drink."
US,88.0,28.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Gorman,"This barrel-aged wine brings bright aromas of ginger, spice and lychee. It's rich and full bodied, showing some warmth on the finish."
US,82.0,17.0,California,Clif Family,"A bit harsh in the mouth and soft, which emphasizes the extracted fruit and makes the wine taste syrupy in blackberries and licorice."
Spain,95.0,167.0,Rioja,Sierra Cantabria,"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014."
France,88.0,21.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Charmail,"Vines close to the Gironde are the source of this structured wine. It has rich berry fruits and a good balance between the fruit acidity and the wood. At the moment, it is dry and firm. Give it until 2018 and it will be a powerful wine."
US,91.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Highlands,Smoky oak enwraps fully developed layers of cherry and blackberry fruit in this thick wine packed with generous tannins. A hearty backbone of oak accents additional leather and dark chocolate flavors.
US,91.0,32.0,Russian River Valley,Dichotomy,"Dry, crisp and silky, it shows complex raspberry jam, buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood flavors. It provides great satisfaction, at a fair price."
US,84.0,36.0,Napa Valley,Tedeschi,"There's a sweet cherry and licorice flavor that makes this soft, direct Merlot taste candied. That sweetness lasts all the way through a sugary finish. Drink up."
US,91.0,18.0,North Coast,Bodkin,"This has a vibrant yellow-gold color and aromas like fresh herbs and sliced celery. Almost electric acidity pulses in the crisp grapefruit, lime and melon flavors that lead to a lingering finish. The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken."
US,87.0,13.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Milbrandt,"This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole."
US,89.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"This shows Spatlese-level sweetness (46 g/L) and alcohol (8.7%). It's poised with moderate acidity and a soft, elegant entry. Flavors of oranges and peaches are underscored with light minerality. A fine, yet straightforward sipper, it persists generously on the palate."
US,91.0,20.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Zaca Mesa,"This winery has been making rosÃ© for more than two decades, and nails the recipe especially well this vintage. The brilliant salmon-pink wine shows watermelon, light red cherry and a stony quality on the nose, while the grippy palate engages from the get-go with red plum, riverstone and gravel on the tip of the sip. Strawberry flavors carry through the strong acidity, and the finish is all about texture."
US,94.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Mumm Napa,"DVX is Mumm Napa's top of the line vintage bottling. This '02 is a 50-50 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, making it a brut. It's very high in acidity, and the bubbles are tiny and refined, giving it the ultra-smooth mouthfeel you want in a superior sparkling wine. The raspberry, lime and pear flavors are rich, but subtle, reined in by yeastiness and a tangy minerality. Drink this luxurious bubbly now and over the next 10 years."
US,85.0,14.0,Yakima Valley,Kana,"This fruity wine is a sugary mix of bubble gum, mint and syrupy peaches. It consists of bold flavors, but lacks the delicacy that Riesling can show in many vintages."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Ribera del Duero,Pata Negra,"Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish."
Argentina,83.0,20.0,Tupungato,Domaine Jean Bousquet,"The nose is yeasty with aromas of apple and hay stalks. This feels lively and citrusy, although the structure and bubble bead are weak. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine finish with a pickled flavor and juicy acidity."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Navarra,Inurrieta,"Passion fruit and citrus aromas are straightforward and a bit sharp. This feels lemony yet wan, with tangy, lean flavors of lemon-lime mixed with fresh green herbs. Notes of scallion and tarragon blend with lingering lime on the finish."
US,93.0,24.0,California,Sean Thackrey,"With a translucent ruby color and silky texture, this could be a Pinot Noir. But it's a blend of Sangiovese, Voignier, MourvÃ¨dre and several other varieties, and shows its own unique profile. Dry and crisp, the flavors are fruity, floral, herbal and spicy. Raspberries, cherries, thyme, white pepper, bacon, oregano and smoky sandalwood only begin to describe the complexities. They change by the second in the glass, but always finish dry."
US,92.0,35.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Grassini,"Equipo means team in Spanish, and this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot and 15% Cabernet Franc is handled from ground to glass by the labor crew that's worked for Grassini since the estate was founded. They know what they're doing, as this is delicious and complex, with blackberry, black currant, bittersweet chocolate and licorice on the nose. The palate packs black plum, black cherry and charred meat with a cocoa finish."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,Volteo,"Citrus and passion fruit aromas emphasize the SB over the Verdejo component, even though the blend is 70% Verdejo and 30% SB. A zesty, pithy feeling palate houses citrus peel and pithy flavors, while the finish tastes the same."
US,92.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Tom Eddy,"Made in a fine, accessible style, this 100% Cab is delicious now with blackberry jam, chocolate and cassis flavors. It has classic Napa Valley tannins that are rich and ripe. This is a fancy wine, that's soft yet complex, and at this price, a good investment."
France,88.0,25.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Simonnet-Febvre,"Pure Pinot Noir, this has weight as well as intense acidity. It's a crisp wine, sourced from near Chablis, cool in texture while showing ripe red apples and quince fruitiness. Drink now."
US,87.0,12.0,Lodi,Plungerhead,"Fresh and lively like a cherry soda, this medium-bodied wine has light, spicy, oaky aromas, lots of cherry and strawberry flavors and an easy-drinking texture."
US,92.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Stonestreet,"Even though this Chardonnay has rich, ripe flavors of tropical fruit, peaches, apples and honey, it possesses an austere elegance by virtue of dryness, minerality and acidity. The blocks from which the grapes were grown are part of Stonestreet's holdings in the mountains overlooking Alexander Valley. This is a fine wine, intricate and powerful.  Drink now??015."
Spain,85.0,19.0,Getariako Txakolina,Hiruzta,"Light aromas of green melon and white fruits lead to a plump, slightly flat palate. Pithy citrus and bitter herb flavors are prominent, while this no-spritz Txakoli reverberates with citrus and tangy green-apple notes on the finish."
US,88.0,20.0,California,Alder Fels,"Bright green apple and herb flavors and light to medium body make this non-oaky wine refreshing and lean in profile. It has appetizing acidity, a great sense of freshness and a lingering finish."
US,94.0,54.0,Sonoma Coast,Freeman,"Just delicious, a nine-vineyard blend from some of the cooler pockets of this sprawling appellation. But don't let the tasty succulence mask its considerable complexity. Light in color, silky and almost weightless in the mouth, it delivers a massive blast of acid-tinged flavors. Ripe, sweet raspberries, cherry pulp, red licorice, sweet pomegranate marmalade, root beer, cloves, smoky oak, a final dusting of crushed black peppercorn, it just goes on and on. Highly recommended despite the hefty price."
France,95.0,115.0,Chablis,Domaine Christian Moreau PÃ¨re et Fils,"A superbly rich wine, with its acidity well integrated into the concentrated and rounded fruit. It has great texture and fruit that bursts from the glass. It is generous, warm and toasty, while also preserving the steeliness that is hallmark of the Les Clos vineyard. Age for at least five years."
US,96.0,27.0,Dundee Hills,The Eyrie Vineyards,"Even if winemaker Jason Lett tripled the price of this wine, it would still be a standout among its peers. This opens with intense aromatics of pineapple fruit, bracing acidity and compelling length. On the second and third day after opening, it remained quite fresh and expressive, with further details of fruit and mineral beginning to emerge. Drink now through 2035."
France,90.0,45.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau FerriÃ¨re,"A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry."
US,94.0,75.0,Howell Mountain,Sbragia,"Those mountain tannins are here in spades, and even though they're ripe and sweet, they give the wine a powerful astringency that demands cellaring. But age will certainly reward, for the wine is huge in currant, black cherry and unsweetened chocolate flavors. Open after 2010 and the fruit will shine through in all its ripe, succulent glory."
Argentina,87.0,10.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Floral, alert and nice on the nose, with tight lime, lychee and melon aromas. Feels good, lifted and layered, with lychee, citrus and tarragon flavors. Shows mild bitterness on the finish, but not too much. Nice TorrontÃ©s."
Italy,91.0,75.0,Barolo,Virna Borgogno,"This bright Barolo with fruit sourced from two of the most important crus in the Langhe area of Piedmont opens with ripe red fruit aromas with toasted almond, cola and exotic spice. The long finish shows elegant accents of mesquite and cedar wood."
US,86.0,10.0,New York,Ambition,"Beautifully feminine, with a delicate cherry-blossom perfume, this off-dry rosÃ© sparkler blends juicy cherry and strawberry flavors, with a hint of earthy, mushroom goodness. Medium sized bubbles are brisk and tonic on the finish."
US,92.0,35.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"Laetitia's finest reserve bottling of sparkling wine rises to the challenge in this vintage, with bright aromas of fresh pears, challah bread and cherimoya. The palate offers tropical touches of guava, with elements of soda and lime pith grounding the bubbly into a classic style."
Spain,82.0,10.0,Utiel-Requena,Vicente Gandia,"This smells flat and stewy, with jammy sweetness and little punch. Conversely, it's pointy on the palate, with tart, generic red-berry flavors and warmth on the finish. A blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,84.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Penguin Bay,"Crisp and fresh aromas of pineapple and melon lead on this pretty semi-sweet Riesling, and are followed by slightly sweet, floral flavors that are kept light with a citric, minerally backbone. Pair with chicken salad, Thai cuisine, even curry."
US,92.0,55.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gramercy,"Coming from a blend of top sites Red Willow and Forgotten Hills, this wine offers reserved aromas of berry, herb, smoked meat and pepper. The palate brings bright acid and intensity of flavor but with a sense of elegance that keeps you hanging on each sip."
France,94.0,39.0,Alsace,Domaine Jean-Luc Mader,"A rich Riesling, just off dry, balancing intense acidity with white currant, hedgerow fruits and a concentrated texture. The wine is full-bodied, very ripe and superbly structured. Very fruity now, this is a wine to show how well Riesling can age?give it 6?? years."
Spain,89.0,33.0,Montilla-Moriles,"Bodegas Toro Albala, SL","With its chocolate-brown color, this PX is full of prune, fig and moderate volatility. It's heavy, sticky and syrupy on the tongue, with fig, dried date, salt and caramel flavors. The finish rings of ripeness, but overall this is more sweet and rich than distinct and complex."
US,85.0,14.0,Carneros,Castle Rock,"This is a pretty good value for a Pinot Noir from one of California's better districts. The wine is dry and balanced, with fine acidity framing raspberry jam flavor."
US,90.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Soos Creek,"Champoux, Charbonneau, Ciel du Cheval, Elephant Mountain, Klipsun, and Slide Mountain vineyards make up this wine. The aromas are lightly styled, with notes of baking spice, caramel, licorice, raspberry and dried herb. It comes off as full bodied, rich and liquorous, coating the palate from end to end with ripe red and black-fruit flavors. It's a hedonistic delight."
US,87.0,15.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Firestone,"Fresh orange blossoms and jasmine spring from a chalky backbone on the nose of this clean and crisp semisweet bottling that also shows tangerine pith, lemon-lime soda and a touch of quinine. Though a bit sweet on the sip, it is far from cloying and remains refreshing throughout."
Argentina,88.0,18.0,Salta,Anko,"Big, smoky dark-berry aromas come with no small amount of graphite, pencil eraser and baked notes. This feels chewy and earthy, while roasted flavors of smoked meats, blackberry and molasses finish jammy, with brown sugar accents."
US,83.0,38.0,Sonoma Valley,Muscardini,"Layers of mint and earth are slightly out of proportion in this leathery wine, the finish leaving a somewhat sour taste."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi,Pievalta,"Made from organically farmed Verdicchio, this dessert wine opens with apricot, pecan, tangerine and honey aromas that carry over to the syrupy palate alongside citrus, tangerine and almond flavors."
US,93.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Marimar Estate,"A longstanding estate wine inspired by the producer's Spanish heritage, this shows bright, measured acidity and stainless-steel fermentation, remaining fresh and fleshy in the glass in its offerings of green apple, lime and peach. Thirst-quenching, the fruit flavors are complemented by floral notes of jasmine."
France,83.0,25.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Roger Luquet,"This wine has a soft texture. It seems unfocused, not balanced between fruit and structure."
US,82.0,18.0,North Fork of Long Island,Hargrave,Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors. There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.
US,86.0,21.0,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma-Cutrer,"Toasted oak and vanilla are noticeably present on the palate and nose of this wine, which evolves in the glass to take on a more tropical feel and tastes of ripe pineapple and guava. Medium to light in texture, it finishes smoothly and flat."
US,88.0,20.0,Lodi,Mettler Family Vineyards,"Some Zins handle high alcohol well, and so it is with this lusty, delicious example from Lodi. It's soft and easy to drink, with rich flavors of berries, cherries, currants, smoky oak and spices that turn chocolaty on the finish."
US,88.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Marimar Estate,"Good and complex, but smells a little candied, like mint cherry-scented toothpaste, and tastes sweetly jammy in cherries. This all-Pommard clone Pinot may be going through a mute phase. Try holding for several months."
France,86.0,11.0,Vin de France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"This fruity, sweet wine is immediately attractive and ripe. With its great apricot and pineapple fruit, hints of spicy wood and balancing acidity, it's perfect as an apÃ©ritif?light and refreshing. Drink now."
Italy,85.0,20.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Terra Serena,"Easy and tonic, this fresh Prosecco Superiore offers dried flower, stone fruit and citrus. It carries through to the palate with soft, foamy mousse."
US,89.0,85.0,Sonoma Coast,Hirsch,"An unusually light California Pinot, this wine has lively grape and herb aromas and fresh but lean flavors that make it appetizing while being restrained in personality. It offers a good balance of fruit, acidity and mild tannins."
US,91.0,35.0,Sonoma County,JCK Wine Company,"This wine combines a slight majority of Syrah blended with 28% Grenache and 14% Viognier, the fruit coming from three vineyard sites, including Big River Ranch. Slightly reductive, it carries a huge barrel imprint at first, settling into softer, brighter, luscious tenets of blueberry pie and leather."
US,87.0,23.0,Napa Valley,Beaulieu Vineyard,"Beaulieu does what it's done so well for so long, producing a Cabernet that reflects real Napa character, at a good price. The wine is dry and fancy, with an elegant structure of acids and tannins housing classic black currant, herb and cedar flavors. With production of 43,000 cases, it's easy to find."
US,87.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),L'Ecole No. 41,"This blend of five Bordeaux grapes has the style and lightly herbal character of a cru Bordeaux. Notes of brambly red fruit and peppery herb combine in a well-balanced wine of medium length, with restrained, lightly earthy tannins."
Spain,89.0,16.0,Jumilla,Genio EspaÃ±ol,"Plum and blackcurrant aromas are rustic, dark and leathery. In the mouth, this strikes the right notes courtesy of good body weight and solid overall balance. Lightly oaked, medicinal flavors of plum and raspberry finish with juicy acidity and a reasonable amount of oak."
France,86.0,13.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau la Tour Chapoux,"Lightly stalky because it is still young, this wine otherwise promises rich black-currant fruitiness as it matures. It is balanced, ripe and with a gentle set of tannins in the background. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),No Girls,"The aromas rise up from the glass, with notes of pepper, violet, cigar box, peat, smoke, braised meat and an earthy funk. The palate is considerably lighter in style than the aromas might suggest, bringing notes of cherry, earth and herb that linger, with citrus twist notes on the finish."
US,94.0,70.0,Russian River Valley,Paul Hobbs,"Voluptuously tropical in shaved coconut and silky layers of peach and pear, this is a complex, age-worthy white from a stellar vineyard site, a knockout version of the variety. Smooth and round, it maintains a core of acidity that buoys the experience, finishing with a flourish. Drink now through 2022."
France,95.0,66.0,Alsace,Leon Beyer,"Lifted peach and chamomile just hint at the maturity of this wine that has barely begun its trajectory. The palate is still taut and firm, fresh with lemon zest and singing with an evolved, lifted purity. This does not need sweetness to propel its flavor: its slender poise and purity make it soar on its own. The more you taste, the more you find: drops of soy, glints of stone, shimmers of citrus and lanolin. It's gorgeous, concentrated, incisive and long."
Spain,85.0,21.0,Costers del Segre,Clos Pons,"Smoky, sulfuric aromas put you on alert. This strange Catalonian blend of Garnacha Blanca, AlbariÃ±o and Moscatel feels solid and centered, while salty papaya flavors are a touch bitter. A finish with little flavor but good texture close this out."
France,93.0,140.0,Corton,Pierre AndrÃ©,"Juicy red fruits are the veneer on a wine that is structured and complex, full of tight tannins, intense acidity and the promise of a long-term future. The dry center of the wine holds the exuberant fruit flavors together, while the aftertaste is all freshness."
US,88.0,24.0,St. Helena,Salvestrin,"This is dry, full bodied and spicy. It's all about upfront flavors of citrus, green grass, hay, vanilla and honey, brightened with brisk acidity. Easy to drink with a wide range of foods."
Spain,89.0,17.0,Rueda,Naia,"Minerally, slightly dusty apple aromas lead into a well-balanced palate with body and zesty acidity. Peach, green melon and white-pepper flavors fade out on a pulpy finish with good acidic cut."
Italy,85.0,20.0,Chianti Classico,Bindi Sergardi,"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here."
US,91.0,65.0,Santa Maria Valley,Gary Farrell,"Black cherry, clove, allspice and fresh hibiscus make for an enticing nose on this wine by the longtime Russian River Valley producer. Rose petals, cranberry juice, dried oregano and more hibiscus together for a bountiful palate."
Italy,89.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,"Earthy aromas quickly transition to ripe marasca cherry and cake spices. The palate delivers juicy red berry, mint and white pepper alongside polished but not very persistent tannins. It's already accessible so drink now through 2019."
US,87.0,34.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Gersing,"This offers light red fruits and a dusting of spices. It's modest and balanced, with proportionate tannins and a chocolate note from aging in French oak barrels. It's a light, pleasant, but nondescript wine."
Australia,89.0,20.0,Barossa Valley,Atze's Corner,"This wine shows a pleasing nose of black currant cordial, violets, hot cocoa powder and some smokey oak aromas. The palate is relatively light in feel for the powerful three (Grenache, Shiraz, MourvÃ¨dre), yet with a juicy fruit core, grainy texture and savory tannins, this is a solid GSM."
US,92.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Dusted Valley,"A blend of Syrah (62%), Petite Sirah (25%) and MourvÃ¨dre, this no-holds-barred wine offers aromas of potpourri, orange peel, peppery spices and dark fruit. It's ripe and full bodied with a finish that lingers."
US,89.0,30.0,Sonoma Mountain,Laurel Glen,"What a nice wine for drinking now. The second wine of esteemed Laurel Glen, it's made from 100% Cabernet. The grapes from Sonoma County have been joined by fruit from Napa Valley, resulting in plenty of blackberry and cherry richness. With classy tannins, it's a great success for the chilly 2011 vintage."
US,86.0,15.0,Hudson River Region,Whitecliff Vineyard,This fruity forward wine boasts punchy tangerine and lemon flavors with a tart melon-rind edge. It's a touch herbaceous and dusty but finishes brisk and clean.
US,92.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"Yet another fruit-powered, lip-smacking Riesling from Trisaetum, this brings a basket of yellow apples, tart limes, pears and a slice of pink grapefruit into perfect harmony. Leesy, textural, long and utterly refreshing, it finishes with a nice kick of bracing acidity."
France,92.0,19.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel,"A touch of dried citrus peel on the nose suggests slight development. The palate adds judicious weight and backbone in the form of very fine creamy mousse and a lovely structure that holds mellow apple fruit and bright citrus. The finish is dry, fresh but mellow. Both autolysis and lemon freshness become apparent on the long aftertaste. It's a sophisticated, refreshing but rounded winter time apÃ©ritif."
Italy,90.0,23.0,Lugana,Pratello,"Delicate aromas of white spring blossom, citrus and orchard fruit waft from the glass. The round palate delivers white peach, creamy green apple, lemon drop and and a hint of vanilla brightened by fresh acidity. A mineral note marks the finish."
US,84.0,32.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Cairdeas,"Almost equal parts Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec with the balance Merlot, it comes off as quite green and strongly herbal along with notes of green tea and cherry. It's soft in feel and quite tart."
US,90.0,75.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"There is an opulence of ripe, black fruit in this Pinot, a selection from various vineyard sources throughout the appellation. Floral in violet and rose, it offers rich cardamom-cinnamon spice and a balanced taste of cola and jam."
France,93.0,45.0,Alsace,RenÃ© MurÃ©,"Clos Saint Landelin is a portion of the Vorbourg Grand Cru vineyard wholly owned by MurÃ©. This rich wine is comfortably excessive, very full of spice and lychee flavors. Medium dry in character with a dry core, it is still young and could age. Drink from 2017."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Toscana,Campo di Sasso,"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a dollop of Petit Verdot, this has subtle aromas of ground pepper, toast, French oak and espresso. The aromas follow over to the rather lean, straightforward palate along with a note of fresh cherry set against loose-knit, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years."
US,86.0,27.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Medium bodied, this wine has layers of dark red fruits, plus touches of earth and tobacco, especially on the finish."
France,89.0,18.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de Hauterive,"Even after four years, this wine is showing strong wood flavors. Hopefully this burnt toastiness will calm down, because the fruit has potential. It is rich and packed with blueberry and black currant fruits while still firmly tannic. Drink from 2017."
France,86.0,8.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Moulin de BeausÃ©jour,"Soft, round and balanced, this ripe wine is ready to drink. It's led by the cherry and black currant flavors, with dryness that comes from the soft tannins."
US,92.0,59.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"This is a complex Pinot Noir, dry and silky, showing the delicate structure of the coast in a cool vintage. The alcohol is relatively modest and the acidity is crisp, giving good balance to the flavors that range from cranberries, cola and pomegranates to sweet sautÃ©ed mushrooms, mocha and exotic baking spices. Drink this lovely wine now??019."
Spain,87.0,15.0,RÃ­as Baixas,SeÃ±orÃ­o de RubiÃ³s,"Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, juniper berry and dust are slightly sharp but do manage to fold together into a solid whole. The palate is correct, with green-leaning, semiherbal flavors of melon, papaya and mango. A good to above-average AlbariÃ±o that should be drunk right away."
US,87.0,23.0,Anderson Valley,Husch,"This is a wonderful Pinot Noir to drink now for its dry crispness, silky elegance, and pleasant cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper  and teriyaki beef flavors. Polished and supple, and easy to find, with nearly 38,000 cases produced."
US,87.0,30.0,Colorado,Sutcliffe,"Notes of undergrowth, dark cherry and smoked meat are accented by tones of coffee and spice. The medium- to full-bodied palate is textured with muscular tannins and balanced acids."
Spain,85.0,13.0,Calatayud,Acentor,"This opens with an aromatic note of wet dog along with wild berry and plum. The palate is spunky, jumpy and lively, while flavors of plum, raspberry and berry skins finish short and simple."
US,87.0,34.0,Dry Creek Valley,Wilson,"Here's a fruity wine to drink now with barbecue. It's rich and ripe in blackberries and blueberries, sprinkled with cocoa and black pepper, and wrapped into firm tannins that want some sweetly grilled meat to tear into."
US,91.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Rexford,"There's an intriguing herbaceous character of juniper and chaparral scrub on this appellation-blend bottling, along with red currant fruit and iron minerality. The palate shows complex flavors of pine sap and eucalyptus oil, orange rinds and rosemary against a backdrop of blackberry fruit."
Italy,89.0,15.0,Collio,Conti Formentini,"Alluring scents of hay, white flower, stone fruit and citrus zest take center stage on this one. The refined palate is a bit more reserved when compared to the nose, offering grapefruit, white peach, nectarine and mineral buoyed by bright acidity. It finishes clean and crisp."
Australia,84.0,20.0,Margaret River,Juniper,"This 68% Semillon and 32% Sauvignon is intensely herbal on the nose, and the green character persists throughout, yet never veers into vegetal. It's cleanly made and medium-bodied, with a crisp finish."
Italy,92.0,48.0,Barbaresco,Negro Giuseppe,"This leads with blue flower, camphor, crushed herb and red berry aromas. Firmly structured and linear, the palate delivers succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and star anise flavors supported by a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2022??032."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Hey Mambo,"A whiff of charred wood and pencil lead adds a little complexity to this otherwise straightforward, fruity and rather soft-textured wine. It is medium bodied, and the cherry and berry flavors seem to sweeten on the finish."
France,92.0,45.0,Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"Ripe notions of juicy pear and hay flowers have a lovely zesty edge on the nose. The palate confirms this with concentrated counterpoints of honeyed fruit and bright citrus zestiness. This is full on and rich, and a touch of residual sweetness gives this extra heft and conviction. It is the citrus freshness that provides structure and direction. The finish is merely off dry, so this will shine alongside various dishes. Drink 2017??025."
US,89.0,45.0,Yakima Valley,Co Dinn,"This wine is a near equal split between three varieties: Gerenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre. Mesmerizing aromas of red cherry, plum, wood spice and herb are followed by quite tart elegant fruit flavors. It shows a lot of finesse but still needs some time to stretch its legs."
US,83.0,13.0,California,Entwine,"Refreshing but very reserved in flavor, this wine is clean and basic. With a watery color, neutral aromas and flavors, and medium body, the effect is unassuming."
US,88.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Lamoreaux Landing,"Sumptuous on the nose with aromas of lychee, rose petals and honeycomb, this is a powerful, classically styled GewÃ¼rztraminer. On the palate, it's dry yet juicy with melon and stone fruit flavor. Enjoy now for its voluptuous exuberance."
US,90.0,70.0,Sonoma County,Stonestreet,"A power-packed heavyweight from Sonoma, this delivers a piercing black-fruit aroma and flavor profile. Cassis and plum flavors are tight and tasty, and the long, juicy finish indicates that it could evolve nicely. Anyone planning on drinking it soon should expect a punch. Elegance is not its strong suit right now."
US,84.0,25.0,California,Black Box,"This is a very nice Riesling for drinking with today's ethnic fare. Although it's softer than you'd expect from this normally tart varietal, it's clean and spicy, with citrus, flower and honey flavors. The sweetness level is off-dry."
France,90.0,25.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,ChÃ¢teau d'Or et de Gueules,"This is a full-bodied blend of Syrah and Carignan, aged a year in oak. It's dense and velvety, with an almost chocolate-fudge texture and notes of plum, leather and spice. Drink now??018."
Argentina,87.0,17.0,Argentina,Terrazas de Los Andes,Oily aromas of peanut and burnt match ride high on the nose of this plump and pulpy tropical-leaning white. Typical lychee and honeydew flavors are slightly bitter in front of a fleshy palate with moderate acidity.
US,86.0,50.0,Anderson Valley,WindRacer,"A strong smoky aroma, spicy oak flavors and a blast of ripe fruit make this a boisterous wine. It's full bodied, with heat on the palate. A little berry and cherry concentration comes through on the finish."
US,87.0,22.0,North Fork of Long Island,Harbes Family Vineyard,"Candied cherry and berry aromas abound on the nose of this dry rosÃ©, but the palate is surprisingly elegant. Pristine red cherry and raspberry flavors are fresh and bright, accented by savory, slightly bitter hints that lend nuance to the finish."
US,90.0,60.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Thomas Fogarty,"Sourced from a 35-year-old vineyard with views of the San Francisco Bay, this wine offers aromas of toasted oak, marshmallow, green pear and wet rock. The wood is quickly wiped out by brisk acidity on the palate, but then emerges again on the creamy finish. Given the acid levels in this cool vintage, this wine will evolve through at least 2019, but it's fine now."
Italy,86.0,10.0,Cannonau di Sardegna,Vigneti Zanatta,"Showing Cannonau's lighter side, this simple red has fruity aromas of wild berry and a hint of dried aromatic herb. The easygoing, informal palate offers red cherry, raspberry and a hint of white pepper alongside soft tannins."
US,90.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Lost Canyon,"Caramelized oak and ripe apple provide rich texture and flavor that find ideal companionship in this wine's more rocky minerality and salty tang. Medium bodied, it's a food-friendly find, with ample structure and apple and pear flavor."
US,92.0,18.0,Sonoma Coast,Taken Wine Co.,"Pretty aromas of fresh white flowers and apple blossom open this mouthfilling, satisfying wine. Complex and interesting on the palate, it's layered with tension and acidity. It has a lean, clean finish that's dialed-in for the table."
France,86.0,35.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Lajarre,"Across the river Dordogne from Castillon, the vineyard of Lajarre is on the first slope. This soft and ripe wine has black currant fruitiness, fresh acidity and a judicious use of wood aging. It still shows the structure of 2010, so will be better from 2015."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Cesari,"Forest floor, dried dark-skinned fruit, cedar and smoky aromas come together in the glass. The firm, full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, baked plum, ground pepper and clove alongside solid but fine-grained tannins."
Australia,85.0,12.0,South Australia,Angove's,Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.
US,88.0,35.0,Monterey,Boekenoogen,"White-peach aromas meet with vanilla butter and honeysuckle on the nose, yet there is a tension apparent amid the ripeness. The sip starts with an edgy texture and crisp acidity that cut across flavors of nectarine and apple."
France,93.0,42.0,PÃ©charmant,ChÃ¢teau de Tiregand,"Tiregand has long been the big name in PÃ©charmant. Although the estate fell behind, it seems now to have managed to use a traditional approach to create a impressive wines. This wood-aged wine, with its mint aromas and dense yet elegant tannins, is a good case in point. Wait for 5?? years before drinking."
Spain,93.0,78.0,Bierzo,Bodega del Abad,"This intense MencÃ­a is showing heavy doses of asphalt, raw oak, char, exotic wood and dark berry aromas. It's layered, rich and lively in the mouth, with heady, toasty flavors of smoked black fruits. A mix of toast, baking spices and licorice flavors shadow subtle but integral black-fruit notes. Best from 2015 through 2020."
US,83.0,8.0,Washington,Pine & Post,"A pleasant, nondescript wine. There's 10% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, which gives it a little spicy lift, but the mainstay Chardonnay core seems generically lemony and falls away in the finish."
Argentina,90.0,70.0,Salta,Bodega Tacuil,"Earthy, mulchy, balsamic aromas blend with meaty blackberry scents to create a vintage DÃ¡valos-Salta bouquet. The palate on this Malbec-Cabernet blend is inky, jammy and rich, with soft tannins. Earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry and balsamic vinegar finish with notes of mushroom and tree bark along with carob and fig. Drink through 2019."
France,90.0,25.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau German,"A fruity, juicy wine with balanced tannins and red fruits. It is a lively perfumed wine that has some toasty tannins in the background. Drink this ripe wine from 2019. One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing."
US,88.0,13.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Michelle,"The aromas of pear, spice and tropical fruit lead to well-balanced flavors with a kiss of sweetness. This sparkler delivers a lot of quality and value."
Italy,94.0,87.0,Veronese,Allegrini,"Made from 100% Corvina, this shows the great potential of this native grape. It boasts rich blackberry, plum and licorice flavors, beautifully balanced and velvety smooth. This shows great depth and, while delicious now, hold for a few more years to allow additional complexities to develop."
US,93.0,48.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"The 10% Petit Verdot stiffens up the tannins and has a lovely violet-scented floral component that counterpoints the cassis and black cherry fruit. It's a young, tight and beautifully crafted wine that has barely come out of the barrel; it's still shut down and shy. But all the right stuff is there for a long-lived, elegant and silky wine with great breed and style."
US,87.0,19.0,Edna Valley,Tolosa,"With no oak, there's nothing but bright, searing acidity and pure, intense flavors of limes and kiwis in this dry Chardonnay. There's an undertow of minerals, like the tang of cold steel. A very clean and pure expression of Edna Valley terroir."
Italy,89.0,50.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Tenuta San Leonardo,"A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% CarmenÃ¨re, this opens with aromas that recall red currant, toast and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, leather, game, truffle and a cedar note alongside supple tannins."
US,88.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Clos Pegase,"Seamless and soft, this medium-built expression of clove, tobacco and dark red plum offers integrated tannins and a punch of oak, before settling into a whispered finish."
Italy,89.0,20.0,Coste della Sesia,Travaglini,"Polished and fragrant, this charming red offers alluring scents of freshly picked rose, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity and supple tannins balance the bright cherry, strawberry, white pepper and anise flavors. Enjoy through 2017."
Argentina,86.0,9.0,NeuquÃ©n,Familia Schroeder,"Red berry fruit with touches of vanilla and spice give this bargain-priced Pinot a candied but inviting set of aromas. The palate runs on fresh fruit, and overall it's all about clean, forward juicy flavors and very little extra. A nice aperitif Pinot Noir."
Italy,94.0,42.0,Gattinara,Travaglini,"Fragrant and polished, this offers enticing aromas of spiced plum, rose, aromatic herb and menthol. The elegant, linear palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, pipe tobacco and mineral set against firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018 through 2028."
US,85.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Chateau Lafayette Reneau,"Aromas of mocha and chocolate waft sweetly from this ripe, easy drinking Cabernet Sauvignon. The flavors of fleshy black plum and cherry are soft and plump, but refreshing acidity kicks on the midpalate. The finish is swift, with soft, wispy tannins."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Sicilia,Benanti,"Il Drappo is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that has been aged carefully in oak to produce a soft, rich mouthfeel and lively notes of bright berry and savory spice. There's a touch of toasted pistachio nut as well."
France,86.0,30.0,MÃ©doc,Bernard Magrez,"A firm, rather lean, stalky wine, dominated by black currant flavors. The tannins are dry, dense. This will show best with food, its firmness and tannic character cutting well with rich meat."
US,87.0,16.0,Cayuga Lake,Hosmer,"Earthy, musky notes lend a savory complexity to this bold, richly bodied Pinot Gris. Dry in style, it juxtaposes crisp white grapefruit and lime flavors against hints of smoked nuts. The finish is brisk and mineral."
US,85.0,35.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Crest,"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together."
France,85.0,18.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Amour,This stalky wine shows wood aging as much as fruit. Toast and some bitter extraction are contrasted with tight black currant fruits. It will soften and turn into an approachable fruity wine.
Australia,89.0,24.0,McLaren Vale,Hugh Hamilton,"Cassis and chocolate notes dominate, but there's enough minty, eucalypt character to impart complexity, all framed by some firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long and mouthwatering; drink now??015. Multiple U.S. importers."
Italy,88.0,11.0,Bianco di Custoza,Fratelli Zeni,It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded. Intensely mineral aromas mix with notes of smoke and fresh apples; the flavors are earthy and hint at mineral oil. Long on the finish. Best Buy.
Italy,89.0,15.0,Monica di Sardegna,Argiolas,"This opens up with an alluring fragrance of rose, violet, ripe berry and wild herb. The succulent palate delivers juicy raspberry, black cherry, licorice and black pepper alongside lithe tannins. Enjoy soon."
France,89.0,25.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Domaine Zinck,"Subtle notes of tart red apple and red currant rise from the glass. They also feature prominently on the palate where their fruit expression is heightened by lively fine fizz. The body is light and inherently fresh, making this an ideal and very appetizing apÃ©ritif."
US,88.0,38.0,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Anglim,"Deep aromas of pressed blackberries, blackcurrants and black cherries meet with leather, dried mint and crushed graphite on the nose of this bottling. Purple flowers show on the palate, where a tannic grip binds flavors of blackcurrant, elderberry and roasted meat."
US,90.0,45.0,Sonoma County,Bugay,"A deeply colored, rich, vibrant Syrah, ready to drink now. It's gritty in tannins and bone dry, but offers a wealth of ripe, jammy blackberries, cherries, bacon, peppery spices and smoky sandalwood."
US,88.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pacific Crest,"Apple, pear and spice aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that manage to remain light on their feet. The finish seems a bit clipped but it still delivers enjoyment."
US,86.0,36.0,Napa Valley,Crane Brothers,"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now."
Italy,86.0,12.0,Sicilia,Feudo Principi di Butera,"This well-priced Nero d'Avola takes an informal approach thanks to its pretty notes of black fruit and mature raspberry. By your second sniff, however, you'll pick up spicy tones of BBQ sauce, smoked meat and steak sauce. The wine's tannins are soft and supple."
US,89.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"J has taken the unusual step of blending Pinot Noir with Pinot Meunier, which is not so strange, but also with Pinotage, which is practically unheard of. The addition of the latter certainly makes the wine darker, heavier and more tannic than it ordinarily would be. It also brings an earthiness to Pinot's vibrant cherries. It's an oddball, but a charming one to drink with rich winter stews."
US,92.0,95.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Shoup,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot. Aromas of violets, scorched earth, dark cherry, toast and coffee are followed by dark fruit flavors backed by firm but well-integrated tannins. Just a baby now, this wine should have a long life ahead of it. Best after 2022."
France,91.0,26.0,Menetou-Salon,Isabelle et Pierre ClÃ©ment,"Made from superripe grapes from old vines that have aged on lees, this is a rich, concentrated wine. Full-bodied yellow fruit and ripe pear flavors are sustained by the tight, steely mineral texture and the tangy aftertaste. This dense wine deserves to age until 2018."
US,88.0,48.0,Washington,RÃ´tie Cellars,"This wine is 70% Grenache with the rest equal parts MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah. Aromas of olive, earth, orange peel, black pepper and flower are followed by full-bodied red and black-fruit flavors. It shows intrigue but doesn't quite come together."
US,85.0,12.0,Napa Valley,Magistrate,"Dry and a little sharp, with blackberry, currant, mocha, tea and herb flavors. The tannic astringency really needs rich grilled meats to balance it."
US,89.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Market Vineyards,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It leans slightly into the green, with aromas of fresh herbs mixed with vanilla, chocolate and other barrel spices. The palate is elegant, with a soft feel to the chocolate, cherry and barrel flavors."
France,89.0,19.0,Chiroubles,Georges Duboeuf,"Georges Duboeuf follows this cru estate, owned by the Meziat family, and produces the wine. It is a ripe wine, shot through with young, juicy acidity. There is structure as well as minerality to give the wine shape. Drink from late 2017."
US,88.0,16.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mounts,"Very dry and a little austere, with suggestions of cherry skins, citrus fruits and spices. The alcohol is nice and low, while the acidity is brisk. A fine, elegant rosÃ©, delicate and easy to drink."
US,92.0,12.0,Napa Valley,Honker Blanc,"This is one of the best values in Sauvignon Blanc, or any white wine, of this year. It's completely satisfying, giving Loire-like minerality and acidity with ripe Napa flavors of spearmint, lemons and limes, figs and spices that finish thoroughly dry. Restaurateurs, buy this by the case and serve it by the glass."
US,85.0,13.0,Yakima Valley,Samson,"Done entirely in stainless steel, it offers grape skin flavors and green apple fruit. It was."
US,96.0,56.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ojai,"This wine is as fine as anything from Santa Rita Hills. Although it's young and tight now, its future is assured by the brilliant combination of audacious fruit and classic structure. The blackberry, currant, cherry, anise and clove flavors are wrapped into rich, silky tannins, and brightened with crisp acidity. Best now, with decanting, and for the next 6?? years."
Italy,95.0,110.0,Toscana,Le Macchiole,"Enticing aromas of black currant, violet, chopped herb, grilled bell pepper and a balsamic note almost jump out of the glass. The smooth full-bodied palate delivers cassis, juicy black cherry, ground pepper and black licorice wrapped up in velvety tannins."
Argentina,84.0,18.0,Mendoza,Tierra Prometida,"Plum, red berry and wild herb aromas combine to create a briary whole. As it airs, the nose turns lemony and hard, while the mouthfeel is tight and limited, with herbal, saucy, red berry flavors. Tomato and basil notes appear on the finish."
US,89.0,20.0,Monterey County,Bernardus,"Dry and flinty, with flavors of grilled pineapples, peaches, pears and roasted hazelnuts, this wine has a stony, minerally taste. Santa Lucia Highlands and Arroyo Seco fruit are well represented in this stylish wine."
France,91.0,25.0,Fleurie,Domaine Bertrand,"From sand and granite soil, this firmly structured wine has dark tannins as well as the more familiar red-cherry flavors of Beaujolais. As it develops, it will become rich and fruity, juicy with good acidity. Drink from 2019."
Italy,92.0,75.0,Franciacorta,Ca' del Bosco,"Made without the added dosage used to enhance sweetness in traditionally crafted sparklers, this wine proves that with great fruit no corrections are needed. Flavors include ripe McIntosh apple, bright nectarine, toasted almond and vanilla alongside an elegant perlage. It finishes dry in flavor, with tangy acidity."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Spain,Dominio de Punctum,"Vanilla, apple juice and banana aromas comprise the nose on this flat feeling, sugary tasting Cava that claims to be ?dry??but tastes anything but. Flavors of ripe banana, vanilla and papaya taste like powdered sugar on the finish."
France,87.0,20.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Haut Selve,"A rich wine that shows plenty of berry fruits, supported by some dry but dusty tannins. This is a wine that is going to develop with its firm powerhouse of ripe fruit that is emerging from a tight period in its development."
Italy,86.0,65.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Villa Girardi,"This opens with aromas of cellar floor, moist underbrush, dried sage and a whiff of crushed violet. The robust but straightforward palate offers mature black cherry and a hint of dark cooking spice alongside close-grained rather fleeting tannins that leave a raspy finish."
US,93.0,55.0,Templeton Gap District,Austin Hope,"Dense aromas of caramel-laced fudge and hickory-smoked meats atop the base of blackberry coulis show on this lavish, delicious bottling. Framed in a chalky structure, the smoked-meat element consumes the palate, which also shows black cherry, vanilla ice cream, caramel and rich milk-chocolate flavorings."
US,91.0,38.0,Sonoma Coast,Expression 38,"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Prosecco Treviso,Adami,"Opening with aromas of ripe orchard fruit, this delightful, informal sparkler offers yellow apple, Bartlett pear and just a hint of beeswax. It's fun and fresh, with brisk acidity and a lively perlage."
US,86.0,24.0,Chehalem Mountains,Longplay,"This opens bearing scents suggesting banana and tropical fruit, with an oily character. On the palate, the flavor veers toward sour apple, with tart acids. The finish brings in a lick of butter, but at the moment it doesn't quite come together. This may benefit from more bottle age."
US,90.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Ridge,"A first-class Zinfandel, showing the variety's briary, brambly personality. The flavors are of ripe wild summer berries, cola, pine extract, black pepper and cinnamon, wrapped into firm tannins and finishing sweet and long."
US,92.0,27.0,Santa Barbara County,Jaffurs,"Here's a rich, ripe, opulent Syrah, all jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and housed in a structure of firm, strong tannins. It's a blend of some of the best vineyards in the county, including Bien Nacido, Larner and Ampelos. Drink now??015."
Italy,87.0,35.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Le BÃ¨rne,"Dense and hearty, this has subtle aromas of stewed prune, espresso and French oak. The brawny palate offers blackberry extract, licorice, ground pepper and the heat of evident alcohol alongside tightly packed, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unfurl then drink up before the remaining fruit dries up."
Australia,88.0,13.0,South Australia,Beresford,"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus."
US,84.0,32.0,Clear Lake,Ceago Vinegarden,"Soft and melted, this Cab has pastry-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. It's a bit on the sweet side, and could use greater tannin and acid structure."
US,86.0,52.0,Napa Valley,Long Meadow Ranch,"Blended with 7% Petit Verdot and 7% Petite Sirah, this velvety and dense wine conveys a pronounced element of charred oak. A reduced note from the barrel permeates at first before allowing aromas and flavors of baked plum to show."
Australia,93.0,50.0,Mornington Peninsula,Eldridge Estate,"Only a portion of this postage-stamp property (8 acres) is planted to Pinot Noir, so quantities of this gem are tiny. That said, it epitomizes Mornington's charm, offering floral scents, generous fruit and a supple, silky texture. Dried flowers, black cherries and hints of vanilla mingle easily, lingering through a long, fruit-driven finish. Drink now??023."
US,90.0,75.0,Edna Valley,Chamisal Vineyards,"This is a massively rich style of Chardonnay bordering on fat, but delicious throughout. The nose offers aromas of golden apple slices, jasmine, honeysuckle, marzipan, melon and prominent pineapple. Once sipped, vanilla-laced butter and sea-salt caramel flavors ensure."
US,88.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Robert Mondavi,"Classic and restrained, with herbal components and a firm tannic backbone, this is a finely made wine at a respectable price that's easy to enjoy and share. Savory currant, leather and oak define it best."
Italy,87.0,43.0,Barolo,Beni di Batasiolo,"The color is showing serious signs of browning, and the nose already has mushroom and very earthy aromas mingled in with the fresh fruit. Probably at its peak, and unlikely to get better, it is however a nice example of a mature Barolo, but not a wine for the long term."
Spain,90.0,144.0,Manchuela,Finca Sandoval,"This blend of 66% Touriga Nacional and one-third Syrah is unique for Spain but qualifies as ?international??in style. Cola, blueberry and floral aromas dominate, giving way to an easy feeling palate with cola, molasses, brown sugar and blackberry flavors. It's flavorful and rich but not overly complex or layered; drink this magnum now through 2017."
France,87.0,13.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Chevalier de Lafoux Sainte Anne,"This is a tangy, fruity wine, with orange and spice flavors. It is rich and full of citrusy acidity, with a tight structure. The wine needs a few more months, so drink from late 2017."
Argentina,87.0,11.0,Mendoza,Trivento,"Tropical aromas are a tiny bit grassy and oily. In the mouth, this is acidic and tangy, while lime and green-herb flavors are snappy. Crisp citric acidity creates sizzle on a racy finish."
US,86.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Woodenhead,"Funky and slightly sweet, this wine is somewhat flat on the palate, between soft and spicy layers of classic Russian River Valley cola-cherry and black tea. It finishes on the same theme, without much in the way of acidity."
US,88.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ocelli,"This is the inaugural release from this winery, which dedicates itself to the production of Grenache. A blend of fruit from Alder Ridge and Upland vineyards, it brings aromas of red plum, herb and spice that are followed by elegant, mouthwatering red-fruit flavors. It shows the variety's more delicate side."
US,91.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Grgich Hills,"This is a beautiful botrytised wine, made from a field blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and GewÃ¼rztraminer. Light on its feet and reined-in in terms of sweetness, it's golden hay-colored and has a touch of reduction, allowing the Riesling nose to dominate. Decadent yet restrained, it's also lengthy and complex, with highlights of orange and pear."
US,91.0,32.0,Carneros,Mahoney,"Quite a good Pinot, dry and complex. Although it's pale in color and lightly silky in the mouth, it packs a punch, delivering waves of cherry, cranberry, spice and sandalwood flavors. One quibble is that acidity is high, which calls for rich fare to pair it with, such as Ahi tuna, beef and lamb."
US,87.0,30.0,Green Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"The winery's GewÃ¼rztraminers always have a slightly sugary taste, but their 2012 is more evident in that off-dryness than in past vintages, and seems softer, too. It's rich, fruity and spicy, with a honeyed finish that will make it perfect with slightly-sweet Southeast Asian foods."
Australia,88.0,17.0,McLaren Vale,Wayne Thomas,"This full-bodied Shiraz isn't that complex, but it's immediately gratifying for its lashings of vanilla and blackberry fruit. Lush and oaky, it fits the mold of many steakhouse reds."
Italy,88.0,60.0,Sicilia,Marabino,Orange peel and zesty tangerine follow aromas of honey and butterscotch. Moscato della Torre is a smooth and generous wine with intense flavors and medium acidity. Drink it alone or with aged cheese.
US,91.0,52.0,Napa Valley,Frazier,"Delicious, with pleasurable flavors of milk chocolate, cherries and dried red currants, as well as the sweet toast of oak. The tannins are wonderfully pure and complex, in the Napa style."
US,94.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Trefethen,"This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now??016."
US,91.0,38.0,Santa Maria Valley,Challen,"A plump nose full of fruit and spice shows black raspberry and mace. The palate is well fleshed out, with a range of fruit-forward flavors, including mulberry and exotic plum. Graphite minerality binds it together, surrounding tangy acidity."
US,95.0,100.0,Rutherford,Flora Springs,"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8??0 years."
US,92.0,55.0,Mendocino County,MasÃºt,"A very earthy Pinot Noir with tinges of mushroom and leather. This is a fine, sipping wine that's concentrated and smooth. A perfect companion to rustic foods, like pork tenderloin or richly sauced pulled-pork sandwiches."
US,93.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"Creamy yet not overly viscous, this wine finds a nice balance between fruit and juicy acidity, showing off well-crafted apricot, green apple and nut notes. Light bodied and totally fresh, it gains layers of citrus as it evolves in the glass."
France,86.0,19.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Cave de Cleebourg,"While there is some spice here, the wine is more dominated by its acidity, fresh pear and crisp texture. It's lively, fragrant and probably best as an apÃ©ritif."
Spain,82.0,15.0,ValdepeÃ±as,Bodegas Los Llanos,"Heavy oak-based aromas provide cover for the grassy, green scents. It feels clunky and grabby, with jumbled flavors of sweet oak and green-leaning fruit."
Italy,86.0,40.0,Barbaresco,Molino,"This opens with camphor, medicinal herb and cellar floor aromas. The lean, racy palate shows oak-driven spice and powdered sage flavors framed by raspy tannins."
Spain,90.0,45.0,Priorat,Clos Berenguer del Molar,"Dense black cherry and stewed plum aromas introduce this round, jammy and ultraripe Syrah. In the mouth, the wine is rich and chunky, with brandied cherry and baked berry and plum flavors topped with sprinkles of nutmeg and cumin. Nothing evaporates on the ripe finish. Drink through 2018."
US,82.0,8.0,California,Domino,"Candied flavors of blackberries and cherries mark this dry, full-bodied Cab. It's an everyday sipper for easy fare, like burgers or pizza."
France,87.0,15.0,RÃ©gniÃ©,Domaine DuprÃ©,"This is a well-balanced and rich wine, with its tannins and acids giving it a sense of structure. With its black cherry and plum skin flavors, this is firm and smooth."
Spain,91.0,59.0,Ribera del Duero,GarcÃ­a Figuero,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012."
France,87.0,16.0,Vin de France,Florent Descombe,"This spicy, strongly perfumed wine is full of fruit and juicy acidity. It's dry and structured, with a firm backdrop of tannins. It will be great for the winter."
US,89.0,14.0,Finger Lakes,Standing Stone,"While this is dry in style, it exhibits all of the varietal's ebullient rose and lychee tones. It has vibrant acidity and an intense, honeyed palate that's full of rich citrus and tea leaf notes. This is full bodied, with a lingering finish."
US,84.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Ernest,"Oak sticks out, giving a caramelized richness that dominates the underlying fruit. While it's dry and moderate in alcohol, it tastes and feels overly-manipulated."
US,89.0,35.0,Finger Lakes,Shaw,"Three years of barrel ageing lends an intoxicating flair to this lushly textured Cabernet Franc. Rich vanilla and spice notes are unabashedly oaky, but the palate is concentrated with black cherry and cassis flavors, elegantly framed with brisk acidity and soft, velvety tannins."
Italy,87.0,40.0,Barolo,Oddero,"Balsamic herb, toast, oak, exotic spice and berry aromas emerge in the glass. The palate is still rather closed and austere showing oak, licorice and tart cherry alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few years to soften than drink before to capture the remaining fruit."
US,90.0,44.0,Anderson Valley,Stemmler,"Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted. The hearty flavors, complexity and firm tannins paint a unique picture, and this bottling makes a dramatic contrast in style from the ?regular??Anderson Valley Pinot Noir."
US,88.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ancestry,"Made with 75% Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine brings aromas of cafÃ© au lait, toast and red fruit. It's full bodied, with coffee and cherry flavors that linger."
Argentina,88.0,25.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Lagarde,"Oaky aromas of mocha and spice blend with racier scents of tomato and red plum. This Malbec feels full in body but sinewy and tough. Flavors of spiced tomato, herbs and salty berry fruits are savory. It finishes with toasty, peppery flavors and choppy tannins."
Spain,83.0,12.0,UclÃ©s,Finca La Estacada,"Oaky, lean red-fruit aromas precede a scratchy, thin, resiny feeling palate. This tastes of oak on top of underdeveloped, stunted red berries, while the finish is herbal, woody tasting and heavily spiced."
Italy,89.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenuta Friggiali,"Underbrush, woodland berry, pressed rose, tobacco leaf, savory herb and menthol aromas mingle in the glass. The palate delivers raw red cherry, anise, white pepper and a note of grilled sage alongside tightly knit tannins and brisk acidity."
France,88.0,55.0,Champagne,Forget-Brimont,"Ripe and full, this comes from a producer based just south of the CÃ´tes de Blancs. Yellow fruits are cut with citrus to give a rich, while refreshing wine. Smooth with an orange-zest texture, it is ready to drink."
US,91.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Bomb,"If ripe, jammy fruit is what you like in an Oregon Pinot, this is your baby. A generous amount of strawberry and cherry flavor is wrapped in a cloak of chocolate from 14+ months in 60% new French oak."
US,86.0,45.0,Arizona,Page Springs,"High-pitched leather, chewing tobacco and desiccated black-fruit aromas lead on the nose. On entrance the wine feels loose and easy, but a medium amount of chewy tannins give footing to the second half of the palate."
Italy,92.0,29.0,Eloro,Curto,"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this delicious wine opens with ripe black plum, carob and Mediterranean brush aromas. The smooth, chewy palate doles out layers of juicy blackberry, ripe Morello cherry, clove and white pepper flavors. A licorice note closes the finish while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2022."
Australia,88.0,36.0,Gippsland,Jinks Creek,"An intriguingly savory Shiraz, laden with meaty, leathery aromas and flavors of pepper-cured meat and coffee. It's full-bodied and creamy in texture, with a lushness that persists through the finish. Drink now."
US,94.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,Kevin White,"This blend of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah presents a lively, aromatic mix of raspberries, Kirsch and strawberry preserves, with pitch-perfect structure and balance. The intensity, immediately upon opening, is riveting. Drink this now??017 while it's so delightfully fresh."
US,87.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Waterbrook,"A moderately aromatic wine with notes of green herb, citrus and cherry. It's medium bodied with chalky tannins and abundant mocha flavors with the concentration seeming a bit lacking."
France,93.0,128.0,Champagne,Pol Roger,"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now."
US,87.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Maddalena,"The nose on this bottling is fairly light, with tangy blackberry and graphite aromas most prominent. The palate is framed by a chalky tannins and a strong acidity, with more blackberry juice flavors and the slightest touch of tobacco."
US,96.0,45.0,Atlas Peak,Conn Creek,"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value."
Australia,89.0,40.0,Eden Valley,Yalumba,"Yalumba's flagship Viognier is a broad, powerful wine, with pineapple and apricot flavors marked by hints of floral perfume and spice. Not quite as aromatically expressive as the Eden Valley bottling, it may be a touch denser and more concentrated, with potential to evolve through 2014 or so."
Argentina,88.0,15.0,Salta,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Oily and tropical on the nose, with pungency and clarity. The palate is full, layered, plump and loaded with lychee, honeydew and green herb flavors. Provides good feel and just enough acidity to make for a long ending."
US,87.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"With residual sugar at 15 grams/L, this definitely drinks off dry. The fruit is spicy and bright, rounded off with a lick of honey. Apple, pear, lemon verbena and even a suggestion of breakfast tea come through."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Taurasi,Donnachiara,"This Taurasi, made from Southern Italy's noble Aglianico grape, unfolds with earthy aromas of tilled soil, black fruit and flint. The palate delivers a core of tight black cherry, tobacco, white pepper and smoke notes along with big velvety tannins."
US,90.0,30.0,Paso Robles,Andrew Murray,"Although the alcohol level on this Grenache is high, the wine is delicious. It shows cherry, cola, bacon and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into firm tannins that call for rich lamb and beef dishes. The alcohol is an integral part of the wine, bringing spicy heat and sweetness."
Argentina,87.0,18.0,Mendoza,Antigal,Initial aromas of desert herbs and blackberries lose steam with airing. A flush palate delivers candied cherry and chocolate flavors that carry over to the solid finish.
Spain,83.0,10.0,Calatayud,Cruz de Piedra,"Candied, flat aromas of cherry and red licorice announce a chunky palate, with sweet plum, raspberry and brown sugar flavors. Drink now."
US,87.0,80.0,Northern Sonoma,Constant,"This Syrah shows the massively extracted flavors that mark Constant's Napa Valley Cabernets. Such an approach works for Cabernet, but on this Syrah, it seems clumsy. It's extraordinarily powerful in blackberry jam, milk chocolate and spice flavors, but it's a little heavy."
Italy,92.0,60.0,Chianti Classico,Mazzei,"Mazzei, operating from the beautiful Castello Fonterutoli estate at the heart of Chianti Classico, consistently delivers top-shelf wines and this expression upholds this proud tradition. The bouquet is rich and intense, with forest berry, chocolate, cigar box and spiced rum cake. Freshness, brightness and polished tannins appear on the close."
France,91.0,30.0,Morgon,Jean-Paul Thevenet,"A very structured wine with tannins and dense fruit. Very Pinot Noir-like in its richness, smoothness and plum flavors. Deliciously rich and velvety smooth."
US,87.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Genoa,"This blend of 50% Viognier, 19% Chardonnay, 19% Sauvignon Blanc and 12% Pinot Gris offers notes of pear and flowers. It's broad and creamy in feel with stone fruit flavors on the finish."
France,86.0,36.0,Pouilly-LochÃ©,Clos des Rocs,"The wine is soft, fruity and ready to drink, with attractive fruitiness, soft acidity and a touch of wood. With a crisp aftertaste, it offers freshness as well."
US,91.0,35.0,Chehalem Mountains,Vidon Vineyard,"Pineapple fruit shines through this excellent young wine, made with minimal intervention, indigenous yeast, and Dijon clones. Harvested early for juicy acids and moderate alcohol, it doesn't short you on flavor, with pineapple, citrus and green melon in the mix. Drink now through 2020."
France,93.0,65.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Tracy,"This wine comes from a parcel that is planted at a superhigh density of nearly 7,000 plants per acre. This gives the plants greater competition between each other and encourages concentration of the wine. That is true in this rich wine with its impeccable balance between white fruit and mineral texture from the chalk soil. The wine will age, so drink from 2020."
France,91.0,40.0,Alsace,Boeckel,"Shy but very pure notes of ripe juicy pear and fresh ripe mirabelle plum appear on the nose. They continue seamlessly on the full-bodied palate where they find a fitting counterpoint in its phenolic texture, which has a pleasantly bitter edge. This is bone dry but unusually full-bodied for a Sylvaner, highlighting the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. The finish is long and underlines the quiet power of this wine."
France,91.0,25.0,CÃ´tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,Mas de Cadenet,This estate wine has rich fruits that are totally balanced with the acidity and the ripe red fruit flavors. A crisp texture offers acidity and a full body. It will be even better by the end of 2014.
Italy,90.0,35.0,Lugana,Zenato,"From one of the Veneto's leading producers, this is made with native Turbiana grape. Creamy flavors of lemon pastry, Bartlett pear and yellow apple are brightened by refreshing acidity and a fine perlage. It finishes on an almond note."
US,87.0,40.0,Applegate Valley,Twill,"This wine shows grapey and plummy purple fruit notes lead to an earthy palate, with hints of stem and coffee. No new oak was used, but it spent 22 months in barrel prior to bottling."
US,84.0,55.0,Carneros,Rocking K,"Thin and dry, this wine has Pinot's silky mouthfeel, but little else. The mushroom, cola and spearmint flavors are relieved by some cherry fruit. Not going anywhere, so drink up."
US,92.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Surh Luchtel,"Another terrific Napa ??9, this one packed with opulent flavors of cassis, green olives and herbs, wrapped generously in fine toasty oak. The wine is very dry and the tannins are fine and complex. The delicious finish goes on and on."
US,88.0,55.0,Anderson Valley,Lagniappe,"Made in a lighter style, this Pinot is as easy to toss back as a glass of cherry cola. It's delicious and savory, for drinking now."
Australia,85.0,20.0,McLaren Vale,Hancock & Hancock,"Bright, lean and vibrant, this is a medium-bodied rosÃ© with gingery-citrusy notes that could go well with fish or poultry dishes."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Monterinaldi,"Menthol, worn leather, moist earth, black plum and a whiff of Oriental spice aromas lift out of the glass. The taut, rather lean palate shows raw cherry, orange zest, mocha and white pepper alongside austere, fine-grained tannins and nervous acidity."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Cava,Cava Blanca,"Simple lemon-lime aromas are easy and fresh. This feels round and regular; flavors of apple, green herbs and lemon-lime end with citric kick and pointy malic acidity."
US,91.0,40.0,Alexander Valley,Aperture,"Winemaker Jesse Katz combines 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc in this blockbuster of a deal, a flavorful, well-crafted wine that impresses in its voluptuous body and spicy seasonings. Raspberry syrup, tar and a mix of cedar and sage accent a grip of tannin that softens in the glass."
Spain,92.0,58.0,Ribera del Duero,Finca Torremilanos,"Despite the less-than-stellar vintage, this is excellent, with dark berry aromas, earthy grit and complexities that rise to the occasion. It feels big, fresh and fruity, with racy black-cherry, chocolate and pepper flavors. Elegant, correct and complete; drink now??016."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Cava,Paul Cheneau,"Dusty lime aromas carry a modest nose toward a clean palate with moderate fruity weight. Flavors of white grapefruit and lime finish with additional citrus notes and stone-fruit accents. It's a nice, forward-leaning Cava."
US,95.0,60.0,Red Mountain,Doyenne,"Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on?a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion."
Italy,89.0,55.0,Barolo,Stroppiana,"Underbrush, truffle and eucalyptus aromas take the lead. The full-bodied, no-frills palate shows spiced cranberry, dried cherry, sage and a hint of cinnamon while assertive, close-grained tannins provide robust support."
France,87.0,40.0,Lussac Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau de la GreniÃ¨re,"This wine is maturing well, giving a firm, structure and some stalkiness. It's dry and will remain that way, showing some mineral texture as well as black currant flavors. The wine will be at its best in 2015."
US,89.0,20.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Named after famed Horse Heaven Hills grower Mimi Nye, this wine brings aromas of toast, custard and pineapple. Fruit and barrel flavors weave together on the palate, carrying through the finish."
US,92.0,22.0,Oregon,King Estate,"King Estate makes several different versions of Pinot Gris, but this belongs at the very top, with pitch-perfect pear fruit at its core. Fresh, textural and brightly racy, it's an elegant and generous wine with a crisp, lingering finish that suggests it will continue to improve through 2020."
US,87.0,19.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Coyote Canyon,"The aromas are unusual, with notes of mandarin orange, apricot, tin and herb. The palate is sweet and fleshy, showing a brightness of fruit flavor."
Spain,94.0,66.0,Ribera del Duero,GarcÃ­a Figuero,"GarcÃ­a Figuero had a great year in 2010, as did many high-end Ribera del Duero wineries. This reserva is heady up front, with malty aromas of vanilla, barrel resin, tobacco, blackberry and cassis. This is huge but holds onto its balance, while flavors of baked black fruits come with vanilla, coffee, mocha and chocolate accents. This modern marvel finishes with vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors on top of lasting black currant and blackberry. Drink through 2025."
US,92.0,55.0,Alexander Valley,Jordan,"This food-friendly wine is most remarkable for its structure and gracefulness on the palate. Herbal on the entry, it offers grip and elegance within sturdy elongated tannins, a note of brushy cedar and sage and integrated French oak."
US,81.0,45.0,Amador County,Sunfire,"Rough and harsh in texture, this is a rustic, tannic blend of Tempranillo and Grenache that has overripe, burnt raisin flavors."
Italy,85.0,30.0,Sicilia,Feudi del Pisciotto,"Aromas of toasted oak and lemon zest carry through to the one-dimensional, lean palate, along with confectionary notes."
US,93.0,50.0,Santa Maria Valley,Ojai,"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Rosso di Montalcino,La Fornace,"Aromas of resin, vanilla, toast and espresso carry over to the palate. It's dense and sweet with drying tannins on the finish. This isn't an ager so enjoy soon with hearty first courses or medium seasoned cheeses."
US,89.0,29.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cinnabar,"Succulent and opulent, with ripe pineapple purÃ©e, Meyer lemon tart, kiwi fruit, pastry crust and tangy mineral flavors, enriched with the buttered toast and caramel of new oak."
Spain,84.0,12.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about."
US,85.0,15.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"This is a little jammy with fruit, while also a little hot, but pretty good for the price. Marked by flavors of raspberry jam and red currants, it's a nice, medium-bodied and balanced wine."
Argentina,88.0,16.0,Mendoza,Finca Lalande,"Olive, saucy berry and a sense of rawness on the nose drive this Malbec towards a solid but slightly scratchy feeling palate. Plum, blackberry and minty oak flavors are short and lightly herbal, while this ends without much force."
France,84.0,11.0,Cahors,Castel Montplaisir,"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from ChÃ¢teau Lagrezette or the luxury cuvÃ©e. There's still plenty of toasty oak, but also some raspberry-cherry fruit and green tobacco on the finish."
Argentina,88.0,17.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"This is Torrontes in its pure, true form. Trapiche has captured the light, floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors. With structure, flavor and balance, this wine will go well with a wide range of summer foods."
US,88.0,32.0,Chehalem Mountains,Anam Cara,"This is pleasant and light, with a strawberry flavor that's lightly threaded with streaks of spice and sandalwood. It's a delicate and pretty wine, reflective of the cooler vintage."
Italy,86.0,24.0,Irpinia,Sanpaolo,"This dense Aglianico opens with aromas that recall resin, nail polish remover, stewed plum and chocolate. The meaty palate offers overripe black cherry and prune alongside aggressive tannins but it's evolved and shy on freshness. It finishes abruptly, with an astringent, tannic close."
US,87.0,14.0,Monterey,Pinot Patch,"With some Pinot Blanc blended in for richness, this wine has a honeyed edge to the lemon, pineapple and pear fruit flavors. It's crisp with Monterey acidity."
France,89.0,65.0,Champagne,Baron Albert,"This bright elegant Champagne is from a family firm now run by three sisters. With its balance between acidity and ripe apple flavors, it is poised between bone dry and a richer Brut style. The wine is fruity although with a crisp mineral aftertaste. Drink now."
US,92.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Parrish Family,"Purple flowers, black cherries, licorice, black sesame, beef char and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling by David Parrish and family. The palate combines clean flavors of milk chocolate and espresso bean with tart boysenberry and more of a tarry tension."
France,87.0,20.0,Chignin,Domaine les Cantates,"Light, bright and fruity, this is a delicious glass of wine. It's fresh and crisp with fragrant white fruits layered with zesty citrus. It has a cool feel, with bright acidity adding lift to the finish."
France,80.0,25.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Majoureau,"Lean and rather dry, this has old wood and lean fruit flavors."
Australia,90.0,95.0,Yarra Valley,Yarra Yering,"This doesn't fit the current fashion in Australian Pinot Noir toward lightness and delicacy. Instead, it delivers rich and mellow flavors of black cherry, tinged with licorice, earth and moss. Drink it over the next several years."
US,91.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Thomas George,"Lemony and light on entry, this tropically kissed, textured white develops body and weight over time, finding a balance and elegance that's hard to ignore. A touch of white peach wraps up the finish."
US,93.0,50.0,Livermore Valley,Ruby Hill Winery,"Outstanding concentration rides an impressive structure in this huge but well-balanced wine. Freshly picked blackberries and raspberries meet hints of chocolate, baking spices and black pepper while vivid tannins and firm acidity lift up all those flavors and carry them to a lingering finish. Compelling to drink now, it's also built to age well. Best after 2020."
France,88.0,16.0,Coteaux du Languedoc,ChÃ¢teau des Karantes,"Allspice and black raspberries lead off the nose, followed by flavors of juicy plum and thyme on the palate. Accents of milk chocolate and earth add complexity to the otherwise straightforward selection. Nicely balanced with a strong, sweet-spice, lingering finish."
US,88.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Coelho,"Aromas of green apple, melon, pear and a hint of Meyer lemon introduce this tart and flavorful Pinot Gris. It's lightly spiced, fruity and compact."
US,89.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (OR),Styring,"Vanilla, dill, pickling spice and dried-cherry aromas are followed by full-flavored black cherry and licorice notes, backed by grainy tannins. The wood and fruit tussle at times but there are still lots of good things going on."
US,90.0,95.0,Red Mountain,Obelisco Estate,"The estate's reserve, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon has been given 22 months in new French oak. Sculpted and well-defined, it offers raspberry and blueberry fruit, set in lovely tannins. The finish shows details of orange blossoms, citrus and coffee grounds. At this time, the new oak is a bit overwhelming, but additional bottle age or decanting for several hours will help to balance it out."
France,90.0,33.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Tardieu-Laurent,"The 15% Viognier in the blend exerts outsize influence on the bouquet of this wine, which exudes notes of honey, apricot and spice. On the palate, this is a big mouthful of ripe tropical fruit, framed on the mouthwatering finish by hints of toasted oak."
US,87.0,5.0,California,Mancan,"This sparkling wine is the best of ManCan's three new canned offerings. It has plenty of rich fruit flavors and a buttery note. Lively bubbles settle into the smooth, creamy texture, leaving an overall impression of easygoing enjoyment."
Spain,86.0,10.0,CariÃ±ena,Castillo de MonsÃ©ran,"Bouncy berry and cherry aromas are more or less standard for basic Garnacha. This wine feels a bit gummy and grabby, but not sticky. Lightly herbal, minty dark-berry flavors finish herbal, chocolaty and a touch green."
France,91.0,45.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Laroque,"Now mature, this juicy, ripe wine has begun its change into secondary flavors. It's still firm, with layers of spice and acidity, yet has developed a warm, rich density that will stay for several years."
France,86.0,27.0,Sancerre,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"The palest color leads to a perfumed, very ready-to-drink wine. It is crisp with fruit that is now softened by a year's aging, offering a touch of caramel along with crushed strawberry flavors. Drink now."
US,86.0,29.0,Amador County,La Chertosa,"This is a well-balanced wine. Peppery and earthy aromas lead to cherry and raspberry flavors, a smooth texture and medium body. Owner Sam Sebastiani uses 65% Zinfandel, 30% Primitivo (legally the same as Zinfandel) and 5% Barbera."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Alessandro Rivetto,"Aromas of blue flower, plum, baking spice and an earthy whiff of porcini mushroom float out of the glass. The chewy palate doles out succulent black cherry, ground black pepper, clove and a hint of game against a backdrop of tightly wound tannins and fresh acidity."
US,87.0,22.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"Freshly-pressed apples and pears are accented by hints of bramble and earth in this slightly savory dry Riesling. Zesty lemon-lime acidity adds brightness to a long, lingering finish. Drink now through 2019."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Roero,MalvirÃ ,This enjoyable white opens with aromas of pressed white flower and exotic fruit. The aromas follow over to the round palate along with banana and a hint of toast.
France,87.0,26.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,Commanderie de la Bargemone,"This wine is rich with smooth tannins that meld into fresh red-fruit flavors. It's a juicy wine with a crisp, acidic finish. Drink now."
US,85.0,33.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Verve,"Soft and direct. Tastes like a liquid granola bar, with melted flavors of raspberries, cocoa, roasted almonds, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink now."
Australia,80.0,12.0,South Australia,Red Knot,"This inexpensive Aussie Shiraz seems to have deteriorated in recent vintages. The 2007 tastes sweet, filled with candied fruit and turning a bit cloying on the finish."
US,86.0,25.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"The mid-14% alcohol gives this wine a solid fruit core, much like a California Pinot. Cherry cola flavors hit the palate immediately, then quickly fall away. Bottle shock maybe, but the wine doesn't show the stuffing of past versions."
Italy,87.0,65.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Giuseppe Lonardi,"There's a touch of pungent apple skin at first, but the bouquet opens up over time with pretty floral tones and shadings of forest fruit and dried raspberry. For an Amarone, this wine is surprisingly bright and crisp on the close."
US,87.0,22.0,Carneros,Peter Franus,"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc. Make it drier, and it would be perfect. As it is, it's a little too sugary sweet in pineapples, lemons and oranges, but crisp acidity and a firm minerality help to restore balance."
Spain,88.0,17.0,RÃ­as Baixas,La Val,"Citrus and apple aromas are straightforward. This feels mostly good on the palate, with some flab and grab. Citric-leaning flavors of grapefruit and orange are softened by nectarine notes, while the finish is clampy like the palate."
France,94.0,90.0,Corton,Domaine Luc et Lise Pavelot,"Still so young, the wine is tight at this stage. It has dark stone fruits and dense tannins along with a lightness of red berry fruits. Power and structure as well as a smoky character from 50% new wood aging."
US,89.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,"GrÃ¼ner Veltliner is fairly new to the Finger Lakes, but Hazlitt's exemplifies the grape variety's promise in the region. Touched with honeycomb and lemon on the nose, it's ripe and rich on the palate with concentrated flavors of white peach, melon and apricot. Bright with acidity, it finishes long with hints of green herb and lime."
US,87.0,14.0,San Luis Obispo County,Stephen's,"This is an interesting interpretation of PG. On the plus side is its very low (12.5%) alcohol, making it light-bodied and easy to drink. There's a little sweetness, not too much, that gives a honeyed taste to the lime, grapefruit, fig, green apple and spice flavors. You'll also find a crisp, minerally finish to this refreshing, food-friendly wine."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Morellino di Scansano,Fattoria Le Pupille,"This vibrant, sunny wine opens with aromas of blue flower, red berry and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The elegant palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry and hints of white pepper and herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the juicy fruit."
US,92.0,40.0,Ballard Canyon,Rusack,"Ripe blueberry fruit meets vanilla, cola and thyme touches on the approachable nose of this wine from Steve Gerbac. There's a well-balanced array of flavors on the dynamic palate, from potpourri spice to blackberry and blueberry fruit."
US,91.0,45.0,Alexander Valley,Rodney Strong,"Lengthy and expansive, this wine offers cherry and herb on the nose, followed by a taste of chocolate and anise, with a jolt of spicy black pepper on the finish. Ready to drink now it's also structured enough to age 2017??019."
Spain,87.0,16.0,Terra Alta,Celler BÃ rbara ForÃ©s,"Prickly citrus aromas are jumpy and a touch sulfuric. This feels leesy, creamy and fat in the mouth, with creamy, tropical flavors of melon and papaya. Bitter flavors of almond and citrus pith vie with lees-based vanilla notes on a round, plump finish."
US,93.0,58.0,Sonoma Coast,Dutton-Goldfield,"This successful Pinot Noir from a difficult vintage treads an exciting line: It contains subtle notes of tomato and beetroot, but that vegetativeness only adds an earthy complexity to the ripe flavors of black cherry and plum. It's a fancy, elegant wine to drink now, and should gain traction over the next 5?? years."
Italy,89.0,17.0,Sicilia,Terre di Giurfo,"Ripe cherry and white pepper aromas lead the nose. The ripe, straightforward palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, raspberry and star anise while smooth tannins provide the polished framework. Drink through 2018."
Italy,87.0,57.0,Barolo,Pio Cesare,"A pleasant user friendly version of Barolo, it is a prime example of the richness and come hither personality of the 2003 vintage. Already fairly mature, it is soft with ripe fruit and smoky aromas, relatively low acidity, and a short medium finish."
US,91.0,130.0,Napa Valley,Nickel & Nickel,"Named for nickel's number on the periodic table, this hillside vineyard site is located across Lake Hennessey on the eastern edge of the valley. Entirely varietal, it offers juicy layers highlighted in cedar, mountain sage and mellowed chocolate. The oak and tannin are well integrated and deeply embedded, providing support and structure."
US,84.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Gia Domella,"Hot in alcohol and sweet in ripe fruit and glycerine. Shows jammy flavors of raspberries, blackberries, cherries and chocolate, along with Zinfandel's peppery spices. Drink now."
US,91.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Whetstone,"A seamless commingling of cardamom and allspice around bursts of black cherry, this is a soft, dark and brooding wine, with an earthy soul and a spicy finish. Still young, it should take on further nuance over time, but is good to go right now."
France,87.0,28.0,Sancerre,Gitton PÃ¨re et Fils,"An herbal wine, this is full of gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It's tangy, tight with a steely texture and a strong mineral streak. The wine is fresh, fruity and ready to drink."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Toscana,Tenuta San Guido,"From the makers of Italy's legendary Sassicaia, this 70-30 Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese blend delivers sweet cherry aromas backed by vanilla and tobacco. This wine has shown a great improvement over the years it has been produced."
US,93.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"Just delicious, this wine shows its pedigree from some of the best vineyards in the valley, including Merryvale's St. Helena estate. Dry and rich in firm but refined tannins, it offers elaborate flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cherries, while 70% new oak adds layers of buttered toast and caramel. Great for drinking now with the best meats and cheeses you can find."
Argentina,91.0,25.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Chakana,"Compared to the regular 2006 Malbec from Chakana, this wine steps up in weight class and wins the crown. It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least."
US,86.0,50.0,Dry Creek Valley,Envolve,"Rustic and dry, this has flavors of berries, currants, licorice and spices. Made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,88.0,20.0,Yakima Valley,Maison Bleue,"This unique old vine Chardonnay vineyard makes cool-climate grape flavors as interesting and complex as any fruit bomb. Spring herb, light floral, citrus and grapefruit combine in a delicate, elegant wine. It's Chablis without the chalk; plenty of acid."
France,87.0,16.0,Chinon,Couly-Dutheil,"The youngest red in the Couly-Dutheil range is just such pure, exuberant Cabernet Franc. It is perfumed, ripe with black currant fruit and a layered with acidity. Its fruitiness makes it a wine to be drunk young, its tannins giving structure rather than aging potential."
US,91.0,22.0,Columbia Gorge (WA),Dowsett Family,"Sourced from vines planted in 1982, it's brightly aromatic with sweet floral notes, orange peel and lychee. Medium bodied, it drinks dry with abundant spice and floral flavors. A thoroughly delicious wine that begs to be paired with scallops or spicy Thai dishes."
France,94.0,163.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Olivier Leflaive,"Intense fruit shines through the toast and youthful acidity of this opulent wine. A generous structure will develop in concentration, bringing out the rich apricot and pear flavors. This is a grand wine, waiting to age. Drink from 2018."
US,86.0,23.0,Amador County,Uphill Vineyards,"This is a rounded mouth-filling wine that takes mild watermelon aromas and adds subtle white peach and pear flavors. It's quite rich in texture, low in acidity and alcohol, and has a lingering finish."
US,88.0,28.0,Santa Maria Valley,IndigenÃ©,"Tar, crushed peppercorn, blackberry, blueberry and purple flowers show the standard Syrah aromas, though they are a bit more complex thanks to a tobacco-ash dusting. Tarry structure frames the fairly rich palate, where flavors of dried blueberry, beef char, lavender and sweeter purple flowers reside."
US,83.0,11.0,California,McManis,"Good blackberry fruit in this Cabernet, and it's fine for everyday purposes. But it falls apart in structure, being too soft and featureless."
US,93.0,50.0,Ben Lomond Mountain,Beauregard,"Baked red cherry, cinnamon, star anise, dried dill and oregano and a touch of Kalamata olive decorate the fresh, fruity but spicy nose on this bottling. Black pepper and more olive characteristics pop on the palate, with crushed herbs, orange peel, tart cranberry, black peppercorns and North African spice properly representing this cool-climate vineyard."
US,85.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Goose Ridge,"Right on the border of being a dessert wine, this unusual Pinot Gris has 2.8% residual sugar. It's betwixt and between?not really sweet enough for dessert, but too sweet for most other food. A simple sipping wine, perhaps?"
France,87.0,13.0,Beaujolais,Georges Duboeuf,"This is a rich wine, with a texture that's comfortably cushioned by ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's a wine to savor now, full and fruity."
US,91.0,40.0,Carneros,Artesa,"Three-plus years in the bottle have been kind to this Pinot, letting the parts meld together. The oak is knitting with the cherry, raspberry and cola fruit, resulting in a creamy-sweet mouthfeel. Very nice, and should hold over the next 4?? years."
France,90.0,40.0,Chablis,Domaine Ellevin,"The wine is still young, with a dense and full-bodied series of flavors that are still developing. As it matures the ripe yellow fruits will come through strongly, assisted by the citrus zest and contrasting with the tight, nervy texture. Expect the wine to be ready in 2016."
US,90.0,23.0,Dundee Hills,The Eyrie Vineyards,"Lightly creamy in the mouth, tasting of wet stone and crushed apple, this young wine seems to gain weight as it runs through the palate. The scent and flavor of peanuts permeates the finish. Showing fine definition and length, it should continue to improve with an additional year or two of bottle age."
France,89.0,35.0,La Clape,GÃ©rard Bertrand,"A blend of 40% Bourboulenc, 30% Grenache Blanc and 30% Vermentino, this is a bright and floral wine, offering upfront scents of orange rind, melon, apple flesh, green fig and garrigue herbs. Flavors of red apple and stone fruits continue on the medium-weight palate, with ample acidity to provide good cut and freshness to the finish. A toasted-walnut flavor whispers softly on the medium-length finish. Drink now??016."
US,88.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are bright, with notes of guava, pineapple and citrus. The palate is lightly spritzy with plenty of grapefruit flavors that keep the interest high."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Korbel,"Another fine brut from Korbel, dry, yeasty and citrusy, just like a good bubbly should be. It's a little rough and scoury in the bubbles, but at this price, a good deal."
Italy,95.0,150.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Il Marroneto,"This is perfumed with classic scents of wild cherry, leather, crushed violet, baking spice and a balsamic note. The bold palate delivers juicy black cherry, black raspberry, anise, white pepper and cinnamon alongside firm tannins. Despite the hefty body, it also shows an almost weightless elegance while the fruit richness seamlessly supports the warmth of alcohol on the close."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Alto Adige,Muri-Gries,"A structured Pinot Grigio, it discloses aromas of fragrant white flowers, apple, pear and a hint of beeswax. The lively palate offers Granny Smith apple and citrus alongside zesty acidity. A subtle mineral note marks the close."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,Pietro Zardini,There's a touch of red apple here that adds to a sense of freshness and overall crispness. Those well defined tones are followed closely by fuller flavors of red fruit and exotic spice.
US,91.0,60.0,Willamette Valley,R. Stuart & Co.,"Refined and aromatic, this rewards your full attention. Polished cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors come with a light dash of herbs and penetrating acids. The delicate side of Pinot Noir is on display here, but in a most ageworthy package. Drink now through 2026."
Spain,87.0,10.0,Alella,MarquÃ©s de Alella,"Appealing bright citrus and slate flavors ride a round yet faintly spritzy mouthfeel in this lively white from Spain's northeast. The flavors and textures show some depth and positive tension. Best for current drinking, it closes bright and dry, with good length. Best Buy. ?M.M."
US,88.0,48.0,Moon Mountain District Sonoma County,Keating,"This is a big-boned, dusty varietal wine, aged in 50% new French oak. Oak spice scents enwrap its leathery blackberry and black currant flavors, finishing on a bittersweet taste of tobacco."
US,90.0,42.0,Mendocino Ridge,Donkey & Goat,"This is a particularly expressive wine with lots of personality. It opens with aromas of cherry, tea and wood smoke, and tastes very dry and structured with vivid fruit acidity and tannins. Sour cherry and raspberry provide the fruit flavors."
US,87.0,17.0,Horse Heaven Hills,The Conqueror,"This leads with light baking spice and apple pie aromas. The palate is broad, with abundant vanilla flavors that suggest strong oak influence."
US,87.0,18.0,Napa Valley,Rutherford Ranch,"A little sharp, but easily the winery's best non-vineyard designated Cab since the '02. Shows a ripeness level that slam dunks cherries, blackberries, cola and oak onto the palate, yet maintains an elegant dryness."
US,81.0,16.0,Napa Valley,Two Wives,"There's a thin line between attractive gooseberry and hay aromas, and more severe pungency. This wine is strong in the latter."
US,86.0,30.0,Solano County,Putah Creek,"While somewhat withdrawn aromatically, this Syrah has integrated flavors of cinnamon, plum and raspberry. It's structured with a tinge of sweetness and finishes on a leathery note."
US,84.0,40.0,Naches Heights,Wilridge,"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there."
US,91.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Walla Walla Vintners,"Hailing from some of the oldest blocks at this esteemed vineyard, this standout wine opens with aromas of toasty spices, herbs, coffee, dark cherry and earth. The palate is reserved with tightly wound fruit flavors and tannins that need some time to unfurl."
US,90.0,32.0,Sonoma Valley,Dunbar,"A 100% varietal wine from near the town of Glen Ellen, this is a healthy marriage of power and grace. The wine is fiery in leathery tannin and full-bodied blackberry ripeness laced in cinnamon and black pepper. Aged in new French oak, it's structured and age-worthy, though quite enjoyable now."
US,92.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Modus Operandi,"This is a big, sweetly oaked wine notable for its ripe flavors and sheer opulence. It's distinctly Californian in the massive, rather jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries, and shows good balance in the richness of tannins and savory acidity. Delicious as it is, it's all primary fruit now. Give it 2?? years to mellow."
Spain,83.0,14.0,Vino de la Tierra de CastellÃ³,Les Useres,"Initial stalky aromas are low on freshness and vitality, and with time, this blend of Macabeo and Chardonnay smells more artificial and soapy. Round on the palate, it tastes fairly bitter and pithy, with a modest white-fruit character that makes a soft impression."
Spain,86.0,24.0,Campo de Borja,Pagos del Moncayo,"This discloses funk, rubber and sulfur , but otherwise is a good but chunky and beefy Garnacha. Aromas of rubber and scrambled egg veer toward boysenberry and cassis, while the palate is grabby and jammy. Flavors of baked black fruits, prune and licorice finish pasty and oaky, with a note of sweet plastic."
Italy,85.0,23.0,Montecucco,Villa Patrizia,"Made with organic grapes, the nose offers oak, toast and espresso. The bracing palate shows dried cherry notes alongside raspy tannins that grip the finish. It doesn't have the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak."
US,83.0,17.0,Virginia,Hamlet,"Soft scents of dryer sheets, lemons, tropical fruits and white flowers mark this Pinot Gris. On entrance, this light-to medium-bodied wine feels loose and flat, but the acidity picks up on the finish to give it a final lift."
France,89.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Pourcieux,"The 18th-century estate that was once painted by CÃ©zanne has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. It is rounded and rich, full of red berries and some tannins. Age this wine and drink, with food, from early 2016."
France,88.0,29.0,Aloxe-Corton,Manuel Olivier,"A soft and deliciously jammy wine. It has immediately attractive ripe plum and berry fruits, layered with balancing acidity. The tannins sit well in the plump cushion of the wine. Not for aging."
Italy,93.0,30.0,Chianti Classico,Monteraponi,"Red berry, wild cherry, earthy underbrush, tobacco and clove are just some of the aromas and flavors you'll find on this vibrant, elegant blend of organically farmed Sangiovese (95%) and Canaiolo. Fermented with wild yeasts, it combines finesse and sheer drinking pleasure."
France,89.0,49.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Domaine Ferret,"At this stage, the wine seems to have too much wood. Hopefully this will dissipate because round yellow fruits are all there, along with fresh, crisp acidity. It is a wine with potential and will be better from 2017."
US,85.0,49.0,Washington,Gianni Buonomo,"The volatiles are quite amped up here along with abundant barrel spices, such as vanilla and toast. The palate brings sweet jammy slightly dried-out raspberry and cranberry flavors but they have a hard time making up the difference."
Italy,89.0,36.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Poderi del Paradiso,"A unique and distinctive style of Vernaccia: The wine offers a thick golden color and opulent notes of almonds, stone fruit, ripe melon and honey. There's style and elegance here and the wine leaves a clean, fresh sensation in the mouth."
France,94.0,24.0,Moulin-Ã -Vent,StÃ©phane Aviron,"A firm and structured cru wine from 100-year-old vines that has layers of firm fruits and tannins. It is a wine that is likely to mature well, with its wood aging and dry core. A blend from four parcels, it is concentrated and with a rich black-cherry character. Drink this exceptional wine, from old-vine hunter StÃ©phane Aviron, starting in 2020."
Italy,94.0,100.0,Barolo,Mirafiore,"New leather, dark berry, fragrant blue flower, rose and baking spice aromas take shape in the glass. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy raspberry, crushed black cherry, star anise and cinnamon flavors, with polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2023??033."
US,90.0,22.0,Sonoma Valley,St. Francis,"Sanguine in cranberry while offering a velvety smooth, rounded approachability, this well-made, robust wine will appeal to a wide range of palates, expressing a big, leathery backbone of tannin and toasted oak."
US,87.0,42.0,Alexander Valley,Cinnabar,"Drink this polished Cabernet now to appreciate its blackberry, currant, herb and cedar flavors. The tannins are astringent, but it shows elegance. It doesn't seem to be a wine for the cellar."
US,88.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Tudal,"The vineyard is in a warmer part of the valley, and the wine is a bit rustic, lacking some delicacy. But it has deeply delicious raspberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with earth and licorice notes elaborated by smoky oak. Give it a good, long decant."
US,85.0,5.0,California,Gallo Family Vineyards,"A very nice everyday wine, bone dry and savory in acidity. Shows polished flavors of lemongrass, vanilla, cinnamon pepper and wildflowers. Puts everything else at this price to shame."
US,90.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, cocoa and milk chocolate out in front of blackberry and black cherry. The palate also mixes fruit and barrel, showing pleasing depth of flavors and intensity along with a silky texture."
US,90.0,80.0,Stags Leap District,Clos du Val,"Dense and briary, with black and red plum notes complemented by a strong sense of clove, this wine is cushioned in tar, oak and cigar box, showing nicely resolved tannins. Blended with 16% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, it is enjoyable now and will cellar well for many years to come."
US,90.0,30.0,Horse Heaven Hills,14 Hands,"Near equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec with a healthy dash of Petit Verdot providing the frame, it displays notes of toast, coffee, chocolate, plum and woodspice with abundant blue fruit and coffee flavors."
US,87.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Cummins Road,"A hint of sweat in the nose blows away to reveal a solid core of cherry fruit, along with broad flavors of stem, coffee and earth. This wine is substantial, though that slightly funky character lingers into the finish."
US,86.0,15.0,Central Coast,Josh Cellars,"Smoked red-cherry and pomegranate-juice aromas show on the sip of this appellation blend. The palate shows fruit punch with touches of lavender and vanilla, which tastes good altogether, even though it is not very complex."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Barolo,Mario Marengo,"This is a loaded wine, ripe with aromas of cherry cola, chopped herbs, white chocolate, blackberry and cassis. The aromatic presentation is never overpowering and the wine is in fact delicate and elegant with finely tuned finesse. Pair this Barolo with truffle-stuffed veal roast."
US,86.0,45.0,Alexander Valley,Murphy-Goode,"From a single, high-elevation block of the Alden-Ellis Vineyard, this is somewhat muted aromatically, preferring to present itself in waves of oak and cigar box. Big tannins and weight surround a soft, approachable palate that's ready to enjoy now."
US,86.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Hill Family Estate,"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short."
US,90.0,24.0,Napa Valley,Napa Cellars,"Leather, cedar and tobacco figure most prominently here with an additional 12% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend helping matters. The juicy core of blackberry and currant brushes against a rustic, burliness of tannin that finds balance and restraint on the finish."
US,84.0,17.0,Sierra Foothills,Drytown,"A sweet version of Riesling, this offers fresh apple and strawberry aromas, sweet melon and cucumber flavors, a soft texture and light body."
US,93.0,39.0,Santa Maria Valley,Testarossa,"This brilliant Chardonnay has the ripe citrus and tropical fruit you want, but is also refined in winemaker technique, particularly a leesy note that marries well with the pineapples in sweet clotted cream. The oak is perfect and the acidity lovely in this wonderfully drinkable wine."
US,91.0,28.0,Santa Maria Valley,Zaca Mesa,"Light and subtle yet distinct aromas of pineapple meet with crushed white rocks on the nose of this bottling. Pineapple juice flavors also arise on the palate, with is lean and crisp with touches of ripe lemon and pear flesh."
France,87.0,29.0,CÃ´tes du Lot,Georges Vigouroux,"Only red wine can be produced under the Cahors appellation, so this is released as a CÃ´tes du Lot. It does however come from the ChÃ¢teau de MercuÃ¨s vineyard, producing a floral, fresh and creamed-apple flavored wine. It is now ready to drink."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Tupungato,Finca Sophenia,"Aromas of dried white flowers and citrus fruits are mild. This feels round pulpy and good. Flavors of melon and papaya aren't complex, but they satisfy. On the finish, this everyday Chardonnay is round in feel and tastes a touch salty."
Italy,86.0,61.0,Barolo,Pio Cesare,"The Pio Cesare is dominated by the smell of diesel. Beyond that are a few shards of fruit, but overall this is a throwback for those who like the tarriness that characterized old-fashioned Barolos."
US,90.0,48.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Big Table Farm,"Crisply fruity, this shows some carbonic brightness, pushing cranberry and raspberry fruit ahead of lighter flavors of cherry Popsicle. It's a lightweight, yet delightful, summertime red."
Argentina,91.0,45.0,Mendoza,Pascual Toso,"Compact, concentrated aromas of licorice, wild brush, fresh herbs, lemon peel and cassis come in front of a high-acid, juicy, racy palate. Flavors of black plum, blackberry, herbs and pepper finish spicy, woody and with some unresolved heat. Drink through 2024."
Italy,86.0,32.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Terralsole,"Scorched earth, dry underbrush and chopped aromatic herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean palate is rather evolved, showing dried cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside fine-grained tannins."
US,90.0,35.0,Alexander Valley,Longboard,"Not many people make a Carignan anymore, because the variety was condemned by critics as rustic. But this isn't a rustic wine. With sweetly ripened blackberry, mocha, toffee, black pepper and smoky new oak flavors wrapped into fine, classic tannins, it might almost be a young Syrah. Lovely now and for a couple years."
US,92.0,22.0,Santa Barbara County,Fess Parker,"Run, don't walk, to get this wine. It's wildly good for the price, offering powerful yet controlled black cherry, tea, bacon and black pepper flavors that are wrapped into smooth tannins. Production was 2,061 cases."
US,90.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Maryhill,"Tight and focused, this has a fine core of black cherry and cassis. Layers of coffee and dark chocolate are wrapped around the fruit, and the wine is compact and textural. Excellent now, but probably better in a few years."
France,88.0,14.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Bertinerie,"Totally herbaceous and crisp, this is a rich, citrus-flavored wine. Grapefruit flavors dominate with a twist of lemon on top, giving a zesty texture that shows a young wine. For it to calm down and broaden out, wait until the end of 2015."
US,92.0,21.0,Willamette Valley,WillaKenzie Estate,"This is a lush and fragrant wine, instantly appealing with aromas of orange blossom and sweet pear. Quite dry and concentrated, it brings further flavors of citrus, grapefruit and lemon rind as it plays out in a lingering, refreshing finish."
Argentina,94.0,90.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Toasty woodsmoke aromas are matched by wild berry, cassis, cherry and marshmallow scents on the nose of this huge Malbec. Creamy feeling but also inky and fully concentrated, this tastes like black cherry and cough drops. Candied ripeness carries onto the finish along with chocolate and dry spice flavors. Drink through 2022."
Spain,90.0,23.0,Ribera del Duero,Tierra Aranda,"A pure nose based on raspberry, blackberry, spice, leather and meaty aromas is attractive. This Tinto Fino features a tight, tannic mouthfeel and roasted plum, grilled beef and savory spice flavors. Long, spicy and lightly toasty on the finish; drink through 2020."
Australia,91.0,19.0,Adelaide,D'Arenberg,"This intriguing stickie is predominantly (94%) Chardonnay?an unusual choice for a botrytized wine. Dried apricot and ripe pear aromas lead the way, with the flavors leaning toward intensely honeyed apricot preserves. It's full-bodied, lush and candy-sweet, with a mouthcoating finish."
US,90.0,25.0,Grand Valley,The Infinite Monkey Theorem,"Concentrated cranberry and red currant aromas meet granite and dried herbs on the nose of this 100% Cabernet Franc. A round body of racy currant and blackberry meet a solid core of graphite, while finely-grained tannins give support. This is a well-balanced showing from winemaker Ben Parsons."
US,94.0,52.0,Russian River Valley,Siduri,"The pedigree of this vineyard shows in every aspect. It's not just the ripe black cherry and pomegranate fruit, or the brisk acidity, or the lush, gorgeous tannin structure. It's the incredible complexity, showing all kinds of mushroom,  cola, smoked meat and spice notes. Simply gorgeous now, and should develop over the next 10 years."
US,87.0,20.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Trio Vintners,"Light berry fruit, pleasingly spiced, with the natural acidity of Sangiovese and a light touch with the tannins. It all makes for a light and very pretty wine."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Alto Adige Valle Isarco,Alois Lageder,"Light and vibrant, this opens with aromas of fragrant spring flower, stone fruit and a suggestion of nutmeg. The palate offers white peach, apple and a hint of almond alongside crisp acidity."
US,91.0,23.0,Mendocino,Husch,"Enticing oak spices in the aromas and deftly blended fruit, spice and mineral flavors make this wine especially appealing. It's medium bodied, not a monster, and combines ripe black-cherry flavors, moderate tannins, muted acidity and a velvety mouthfeel."
US,86.0,21.0,Paso Robles,Pear Valley,"Fragrant aromas of apple blossoms swirl with a buttery croissant yeastiness on this bottling from Paso's Eastside. The palate tastes of green banana, with dried apples and apricots as well as ripe cantaloupe and a slightly buttery finish."
US,87.0,32.0,Willamette Valley,Van Duzer,"This is a forward, rather light, chocolaty wine. The berry fruit flavors are swathed in chocolate, and a suggestion of citrus keeps a frame around it."
US,88.0,19.0,Washington,Boomtown,Aromas of freshly cut apple and pear are followed by dry fleshy fruit flavors with Granny Smith apple notes on the finish. It's an accessible and enjoyable wine.
Italy,97.0,82.0,Barolo,Elvio Cogno,"Wild berry, iris, rose and a potpourri of culinary spice aromas emerge on the nose of this stunning red. Radiant and full bodied, the palate is young and primary at this stage but already evokes morello cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco and aromatic herbs. Bright acidity and taut tannins provide impeccable balance and an impressive, age-worthy structure. Drink 2025??043."
US,88.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Siot,"Fresh-pressed blackberry aromas leap out of the glass of this wine, along with asphalt and a touch of purple flowers. The palate is a study of density and thickness, with black plums, coffee and espresso showing most out of the deep, black flavors."
US,88.0,24.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Mercer,"Aromas of plum and wood spice lead to plentiful blue-fruit flavors that show a fine sense of purity. The tannins provide a dry, lightly astringent squeeze."
US,91.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Antiquum Farm,"This unusual rosÃ© is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity."
Argentina,88.0,30.0,Mendoza,Mendel,"Big, ripe, colorful and attractive, with leather and earth on the nose. The mouthfeel is a touch clanky, while the black fruit palate is broad and masculine as it shows a few holes in the fabric. With vanilla and mocha late, this is a nice Malbec with full tannins and grip."
France,86.0,18.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"This is a softly spicy wine that is understated and light. With its brisk acidity and flavors of citrus and lychee, it is an easy, gentle wine that is ready to drink now."
US,85.0,9.0,California,Happy Camper,"Although it's a little slender and simple, it's good for the price and offers pleasant cherry and spice flavors that finish dry."
US,90.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Jacob Franklin,"Aged in all-new American oak, this vineyard-designate is light bodied and restrained, a nice surprise for the variety. Soft, simple and bright, it shows a warmth of plum cake and Christmas spice, ending in a rainfall of black pepper. A nuanced, quiet wine, it should be enjoyed in its youth."
US,92.0,24.0,Santa Margarita Ranch,Ancient Peaks,"There is a lot to like in this blend of 80% Syrah, 18% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, which offers deep blackberry, black cherry, star anise and pie crust on the ripe, exotically spicy nose. The palate is rich with black cherry and vanilla flavors, cut by dark spice, lingering acidity and tannic depth."
US,88.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Toad Hollow,"This dry, acidic young Pinot Noir isn't offering much richness, but does have a nice heart of cherries and persimmons. Nice and elegant, it's pretty good for the price. Give it an hour in a decanter and drink now."
France,88.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine de la SangliÃ¨re,"Light in color and bright in taste, this is a lightly fruity wine. It's the epitome of the French Riviera?hinting at red currants and with plenty of acidity. It is an immediately drinkable wine with a refreshing crisp aftertaste."
Spain,93.0,95.0,Priorat,Clos Mogador,"Plum, blackberry and toasty aromas are pure, heady and classy. Immediately this wine shows itself to be powerful: The tannins are grating and the overall outlook is far from shy. Toasty, dark flavors of black fruits, spice and licorice end spicy and blackened, with hard-ripping tannins. Best from 2016 through 2026."
US,87.0,23.0,San Luis Obispo County,Vintage Cowboy,"Generous black plum, dried purple flowers, sweet raisin and sarsaparilla spice show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are rich and full with bright red plum and strawberry, but there is a rocky core and pinch of oregano as well."
Italy,90.0,24.0,Alto Adige,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro,"If you love Pinot Bianco, you will be delighted by this pretty expression from the mountainous north of Italy. Alpine breezes have shaped a balanced and mildly fragrant white with layers of exotic fruit, pineapple, pear and melon. It shows nice structure and length as well."
Italy,85.0,18.0,Rosso di Montalcino,La Colombina,"This has a nose of mint, blue flower and berry while the simple diluted palate offers hints of fresh strawberry and white pepper. It's easy drinking, with bright acidity and frail tannins."
US,85.0,11.0,California,Barefoot Bubbly,"This is the winery's off-dry sparkler. It's super-clean and crisp, with honeyed flavors of oranges and tangerines. A nice sip with fresh fruits, smoked ham, asparagus wrapped in prosciutto."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Colline Pescaresi,Ciavolich Giuseppe,"Giuseppe Ciavolich presents a wonderful expression of Pecorino with a dark golden color and intense aromas of apricot and ripe melon. It has a soft, creamy quality and touches of caramel and butterscotch."
France,94.0,235.0,Corton Vergennes,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year."
US,85.0,14.0,Amador County,Clos du Lac,Smoky aromas and lean fruit and herb flavors give a sense of reserve and dryness to this medium-bodied wine. It will be good as a house red that doesn't have to be the center of attention.
US,92.0,48.0,Calistoga,Envy,"While this is the most tannic of Envy's wines, it's also made in the house style of soft, fruity approachability. Forward and lush with blackberry jam, currant and spice flavors, it shows an impeccable balance. Wonderful now and over the next 3?? years."
Australia,89.0,20.0,Yarra Valley,Innocent Bystander,"This is an unusually firm, structured Pinot Noir for $20. Floral notes and hints of ripe cherries mark the nose, while the flavors feature cherry and vanilla. Probably best paired with slightly fatty or rich dishes, like roast pork."
US,95.0,58.0,Anderson Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip. Its balance of concentrated fruit flavors and solid structure indicates a long life in the cellar. Best after 2020."
France,86.0,15.0,Puisseguin Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Guillotin,"Dry, certainly not softened by the rich 2003 vintage, but showing fresh fruit, black currants and dry tannins. It's restrained, finely balanced, drinkable now, leaving a soft final impression."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Alto Adige,Caldaro,"Intense aromas of tomato leaf, hay and honeydew melon lead the nose and follow through to the lively palate along with tangerine, peach and an energizing mineral vein. It's balanced, with lively acidity that gives this a clean, dry finish. It's an exceptional effort for this cool, wet vintage."
US,88.0,26.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Savage Grace,"All Malbec aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with pure, penetrating aromas of plum, cedar, mushroom, spice and high-toned herbs. The palate is elegant in style?almost delicate?with bright, tart fruit flavors. Will show best at the dinner table."
France,90.0,59.0,Beaune,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Jumilla,Bodegas Murtia,"Blackberry and cassis aromas are bold and come with a coating of oak that brings vanilla and sweet plastic into the frame. A crisp, tightly wound palate shows plum and red-currant flavors in front of a snappy finish with oak spice and chocolate hints."
Spain,87.0,16.0,Calatayud,Bodegas Ateca,"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance."
Spain,90.0,17.0,Rioja,Olivier RiviÃ¨re,"Blueberry and blackberry aromas are spunky and a little earthy. A juicy, jammy palate is angular and fairly sharp. Wild berry flavors seem right off the bush, while this wine is tight and narrow on an acidic finish. Drink through 2023."
France,91.0,50.0,Champagne,Pierre Moncuit,"This a tight and mineral wine from Mesnil-sur-Oger in the heart of the CÃ´te des Blancs of Champagne. It's still youthful, fresh and crisp, with lemon and tangy citrus flavors. The lively character will certainly round out in 5?? years."
US,85.0,35.0,Sonoma Coast,16X20,"Ripe flavors of orange and tropical fruit jam abound, with a buttered toast richness from the oak. Its appeal is all upfront, with a simple, popular sweetness."
US,90.0,35.0,"The Hamptons, Long Island",WÃ¶lffer,"Hints of biscuits and smoked nuts lend a toasty feel to fresh floral and stone-fruit aromas on this balanced sparkling Chardonnay. Soft, delicate bubbles carry flavors of yellow cherries and blossoms accented with fresh, lemony acidity."
France,87.0,220.0,Champagne,Michel Moritz,"From the lesser-quality 2006 vintage, this is a gentle and tangy selection. It has lemon zest and steely acidity, with light touches of grapefruit and crisp apple. Not for aging, this is an attractive wine to drink now."
US,85.0,18.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Vital,There's just a trace of color on this wine. Light aromas of citrus and herb are followed by dry-fruit flavors. The concentration seems quite dilute.
Italy,87.0,19.0,Toscana,Mocine,"This organically farmed blend of Sangiovese, Foglia Tonda, Barsaglina and Colorino opens with sweet cherry and blueberry notes followed by light accents of spice and leather. This easygoing wine shows medium intensity and fresh acidity."
US,86.0,28.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"A vigorous, aggressive Syrah, this is full bodied and tannic, and it deals assertive blackberry, cherry, currant and sandalwood flavors."
France,92.0,34.0,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,"Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish."
Spain,85.0,9.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Fruity aromas of nectarine and red plum lead to a citrusy palate with flavors of pink grapefruit and red apple. A chalky, grippy finish is basic in its citrusy, pith-driven character. Drink this refresher as soon as possible."
Argentina,90.0,79.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Trivento,"Dark, extracted and woody almost to an extreme, this opens with resiny aromas of raw oak, coconut, vanilla and prune. A palate with pinching, hard tannins is fierce, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted blackberry feeding into a finish with dominant woodspice and resin flavors. Drink through 2020."
Italy,86.0,14.0,Veneto,Cescon Italo Storia e Vini,Il Tralcetto (with a grape vine cutting affixed to the neck of the bottle) is a series of red and white wines that offer easy food pairing opportunities and attractively low prices. This Pinot Grigio shows fresh crispness and clean aromas of stone fruit and citrus.
US,88.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Rock Wall,"This 100% Cabernet Franc shows the high alcohol, full body and concentrated power expected from a Rock Wall bottling. It's dry with fuzzy tannins, and it has rich, complex flavors of cherry, red licorice, Canadian bacon, anise and crushed peppercorn. Decant it for a few hours, and enjoy it now with a steak."
France,84.0,21.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Pierre Sparr,"Both citrus and apple notes are dulled by very earthy notes. The slender palate frothes softly but does not provide more fruit, either. This is dry and muted, but fresh."
France,90.0,60.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils,"This wine balances intense fruit with a steely core of minerality. It is packed with apple, crisp pear and kiwi fruits, contrasted with this tight texture and hints of wood aging. Well balanced, the wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
US,89.0,29.0,Ancient Lakes,Dusted Valley,"Aged in 20% new French oak with half of the wine undergoing malolactic fermentation, it's direct and appealing with peach, melon and buttery spices that lead to a warm finish."
US,86.0,18.0,Alexander Valley,Alexander Valley Vineyards,"There's a soft, candied appeal to the cherry, strawberry and blackberry flavors in this dry, young wine. With a sweet oak jacket, it's clean and pleasant to drink now."
Italy,87.0,35.0,Toscana,Agrisole,"Made entirely with Malvasia Nera, this opens with aromas of black cherry, ground pepper and cocoa that carry over to the straightforward palate. Close-grained tannins grip the finish."
US,87.0,30.0,Sonoma Coast,Keller Estate,"Crisp in acidity and delicious, with honeyed flavors of pineapples, green apples, Meyer lemons, vanilla and peppery spices. Finishes a bit sugary sweet, which detracts from pure balance."
US,90.0,55.0,Sonoma Coast,Siduri,"Eucalyptus, Bay laurel and other herbal aromas dominate the nose of this wine, making way for black tea and cola flavors. Full-bodied and robustly ripe with powerful tannin, it's ultimately earthy and complex."
US,86.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Atwater,"Dusty mineral notes mingle alongside pretty floral and apple aromas on this softly effervescent sparkling. A blend of 66% Pinot Noir and 34% Chardonnay, it's strikingly high in acidity but has pleasant lemon and apple flavors."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Sant'Antimo,Camigliano,"Here's an elegant expression of Cabernet Sauvignon with smooth aromas of wild berries and cherry that are seamlessly integrated with light shadings of spice and toast. The wine is crisp and generous on the palate and delivers a smooth, but determined texture."
US,86.0,32.0,Umpqua Valley,Reustle,"Quite lightly aromatic, it offers hints of barrel spice, cocoa, herbs and red fruit. The palate has coffee ice cream and vanilla flavors with a compact yet elegant feel, showing some grit to the tannins."
US,92.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),JM Cellars,"Purple-black, with rich scents of bright boysenberry fruit, and an unusual earthy umami note that adds depth to the finish. Sharp, young, acidic and grapy, this drinks like a younger wine."
Italy,92.0,64.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Masi,"Aromas of crushed violet, baked plum, cake spice, ripe berry and tobacco pervade in this bold, full-bodied red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, fig, mocha, nutmeg, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins."
Spain,93.0,50.0,Ribera del Duero,Balbas,"Aromas of barrel spice and vanilla lead the charge on this Tinto Fino that also contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. A tough, tannin-driven palate deals toasty flavors of black fruits, char and chocolate, which carry over to the finish. Call this an oak bomb, but at the very least the oak is of high quality and well integrated. Drink through 2025."
Argentina,86.0,25.0,Mendoza,Durigutti,"IThe nose is all prune and dessicated berry, while the palate is low on acid and feels heavy. Flavors of baked berry and raisin finish the same."
US,85.0,26.0,Fiddletown,Winery by the Creek,"Well-balanced, this medium- to full-bodied Zin offers spice and berry aromas and plummy flavors. The noticeable, firm tannins are a good thing in Zinfandel, which can sometimes be too soft."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Trentino,Maso Poli,"Lively freshness and tangy citrus notes open this easy-going Italian white. This Pinot Grigio shows more intensity of aromas with layers of grapefruit, peach and honeydew melon. In the mouth, it feels smooth and polished."
US,88.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Joseph Phelps,"A beautifully sweet, honeyed dessert wine with savory flavors of apricots, green apples and pineapples, this sweety is balanced with crisp acidity. Easy to drink, with just 8% alcohol."
US,86.0,24.0,Santa Maria Valley,Sobriquet Winery,"Strong and oaky but not particularly subtle or complex. It's impressive for its sheer power, offering blasts of buttered toast, butterscotch, pineapple and orange jam and vanilla, wrapped up in a creamy texture."
US,88.0,18.0,Amador County,Andis,"Light pink in color, this wine is fresh and zesty in aroma, mild and pretty in flavor and light on the tongue, with just a hint of sweetness. Made from 80% Zinfandel and bottled with an elegant screen-printed label, it's as a classy version of white Zinfandel."
Italy,93.0,100.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Bertani,"Aged in traditional oak casks for six long years, Bertani's beautiful 2004 Amarone delivers the best of Valpolicella. It shows beautiful complexity and elegance that is articulated by tobacco, brown sugar, cassis and sweet tobacco flavors. There's substance and length on the close with a delicately smoky aftertaste."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Insomnia,"Rustic and a little sweet tasting, this has flavors of cherry pie, red currant and toast. Drink it with cheeseburgers."
US,87.0,14.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"This bottling has consistently been one of Eberle's specialties for quality and price for many years, and it still is. With residual sugar of 5.6%, it's sweet in honey, apricot, orange, guava and Meyer lemon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity."
France,85.0,20.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Grand Bourgeau,"Dense and dry, this is a tough, extracted wine. It has a hard edge followed by juicy acidity and will probably remain on the dry side."
US,87.0,24.0,Dry Creek Valley,Dashe Cellars,"A pace off the 2007, but a pretty good Zin. Despite being a little too soft and candy-sweet, it sure is tasty, offering an array of ripe wild red berry, currant, licorice, cocoa, spice and sandalwood flavors."
US,88.0,30.0,Columbia Gorge (OR),Viento,"Pinot Noir from Washington? Yes, it's possible, and in this case, exceptional. Don't look for California sweetness and extract here, but you'll find genuine varietal character and perfect ripeness, without the leafy, tomato flavors that can plague parts of Oregon. This is gentle, elegant, light and captivating, like a perfectly made Bourgogne rouge from a great vintage."
US,82.0,15.0,Monterey County,Formation,"There's an earthy note of mushroom in this dry, lean, acidic Chardonnay. The fruit suggests pineapples and peaches, but it's watered down and simple."
US,91.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Altvs,"Lush ripe plum, licorice and toasty oak form a triangle of flavor in this blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, with 6% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. The tannins are undoubtedly present yet soft. Much of the fruit comes from cool Coombsville, with a slight floral characteristic popping up from the midpalate through to the finish."
Italy,91.0,119.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,CÃ²lpetrone,"Gold shows unexpected sophistication for the otherwise overtly bold and gregarious Sagrantino grape. Those prickly tannins you recognize from the variety are wrapped by layers of spice, cured meat and dried berry fruit."
Italy,86.0,32.0,Bolgheri,Campo alla Sughera,"Oak, honey, toasted nut and lime aromas carry over to the firm palate along with mature yellow-apple skin. Lacking fruit richness, you'll detect evident alcohol while a note of bitter walnut closes the finish."
France,87.0,35.0,Champagne,Nicolas Feuillatte,"Features very bright, almost candied, aromas of cherries and strawberries that are followed up on the palate by a creamy texture and more red fruit. There?s a slight hint of green herbs, but it?s well under control."
US,85.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Acre Twenty-one,"Straight down the fairway with notes of freshly scooped cantaloupe and pear slices. It's textured in feel showing little obvious oak influence, finishing a bit short."
Argentina,87.0,15.0,Mendoza,Mascota,"Grassy aromas include notes of citrus, apple, wheat and pool water. This feels fruity and a touch pulpy. Tropical, briny white-fruit flavors are pithy and finish light in weight, citrusy in flavor and ultimately a touch bitter."
France,86.0,19.0,CÃ´te Chalonnaise,Vignerons de Buxy,"This light and fruity wine has acidity sustaining the red-cherry flavors. It has a dry core along with really juicy flavors and soft tannins. Drink now, although the wine will be even fruitier from 2016."
France,88.0,67.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Vray Croix de Gay,"Relatively lightweight, the wine has soft, stalky tannins and flavors of hedgerow fruits to go with the well-judged layer of smoky wood. It is dry, firm and fresh."
France,91.0,36.0,Chablis,Domaine Vrignaud,"This is a beautiful, bright wine, still very young although already hinting at the warmth of Fourchaume. The steely texture is right up front, along with crisp apple and citrus fruits. Underneath, a vanilla, toasty character shows promise for aging. Drink from 2017."
Italy,92.0,20.0,Etna,Tenuta delle Terre Nere,"Delicate, attractive aromas of chamomile, pear and brimstone lead the nose on this graceful wine. The linear palate delivers green apple, juicy pear, savory herb and mineral alongside fresh acidity. It's linear, vertical and elegant. Hold for complexity. Drink 2015??020."
Australia,87.0,10.0,Central Ranges,Block 50,"A supple, medium-bodied Shiraz ideal for near-term consumption, the 2009 Block 50 Shiraz delivers clean aromas and flavors of dark fruit?black cherries and plums?and a hint of vanilla. It does turn a bit tart on the finish."
Italy,85.0,47.0,Gavi,La Scolca,"Linear mineral tones create an elegant frame for floral aromas and peach flavors. This is a thin wine, but also a very clean one with fresh acidity and citrus zest that wash clear over the palate."
US,86.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Goose Watch,"Layers of vanilla, spice and toast persist throughout this richly textured wine. Sunny raspberry and cherry flavors are pleasant, but peek through a bit shyly on the palate. It's an oaky wine, but supple and seductive with a fringe of finely grained, persistent tannins."
Italy,83.0,14.0,Prosecco,Cavicchioli,This Ã¼ber-simple sparkler has an extremely shy nose while the diluted off-dry palate offers mere suggestions of tropical fruit and a confectionery note. Brisk bubbles provide the backdrop.
France,93.0,35.0,Chablis,La Chablisienne,"This is a rich wine with a warm character. It comes from vines in the heart of Chablis, facing the Grand Cru vineyards on the opposite side of the river. It's full bodied and ripe, with plenty of acidity to partner its yellow fruit. Drink from 2019."
US,92.0,48.0,Napa Valley,Broman,"This late-release has benefited from its time in bottle. Juicy and beguiling in red raspberry and black cherry fruit, it has a back layering of spicy cardamom and a sphere of acidity. Buoyant and memorable, it finishes with more spice and savory leather."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Cordella,"Here's a straightforward Rosso with flavors of succulent black cherry, wild strawberry, truffle, white pepper and clove. It's round, ripe and extremely accessible so enjoy this now."
US,81.0,29.0,Finger Lakes,Ventosa,"Tar, tobacco and smoke can't mask the green tomato leaf characteristics on this ruby red Sangiovese. There are some interesting spice notes, but not a lot of ripeness or concentration in the fruit."
France,92.0,20.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Mas de Libian,"This superripe blend of Grenache (70%), Syrah (15%) and MourvÃ¨dre (15%) is full-bodied, with a rich, creamy texture and a long, velvety finish. Spice and herb notes accent dusty black cherries, and a hint of cocoa sneaks in as well. Drink now??017."
Argentina,89.0,15.0,Agrelo,Lamadrid,"Plum and blackberry aromas are fresh, while the palate on this fruity red is round and chewy. Blackberry and mild herbal notes make for a nice, familiar flavor profile, while the finish is solid and holds form."
US,92.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Marimar Estate,"Marked by high acidity and stony minerals, this is an austerely elegant Chardonnay. Its natural lime and Meyer lemon flavors have been enriched with sweet oak. Shows the pedigreed finesse of its chilly climate estate origin. Drink now."
US,84.0,14.0,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"Dry indeed; this is so dry as to be outright sour. It's an acid-lover's dream wine; but be prepared to pucker up. It's a mouthful of lemon juice, some cardboardy phenolics, and very tart green apples."
US,88.0,40.0,Temecula Valley,Hart,"Darker in color than many other versions of the variety, this bottling shows hearty charred meat, blackberry, gravel and condensed rose petal aromas. There's a leathery structure to the palate, where peppercorn, tobacco and red fruit notes lead into a mocha-laced finish.While it lacks the typical Cabernet Franc freshness, it has plenty of depth."
US,87.0,23.0,Finger Lakes,Heart & Hands,"A blend of grapes from three vineyard sites, this is an interesting contrast to its single-vineyard siblings. It's dry in style yet rich on the palate, with a distinctly creamy texture, offsetting a juicy fruit flavor with savory tones of herb, fennel and lanolin."
US,92.0,26.0,Paso Robles,Dunning Vineyards,"One of the many vintners proud of their forthcoming Willow Creek District appellation, Bob and Jo-Ann Dunning's Chardonnay presents delicate aromas of yellow flowers, vanilla bean, peach skin and limestone. The white rocks extend to the palate, picking up nectarine elements, too, creating a lean but flavorful wine that's refreshing enough to sip all night."
France,86.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Saint-Florin,"This is a ripe wine that has a high proportion of SÃ©millon in the blend. That makes it rich: revealing yellow fruits as well as greener herbal characters. It is fruity, tangy and refreshing. Drink from spring 2017."
France,88.0,22.0,Brouilly,Robert Perroud,"Named after the steeply sloping vineyard, the wine is cool, crisp with tight cherry flavors. It is lined with acidity and some tannins. The wine will need another few months to soften out and become richer."
US,85.0,15.0,Columbia Valley (WA),City Limits,"The wine's label sports a black and white image of a city skyline, and the wine inside the bottle might make for a decent glass pour at an urban bistro. There's a lot of vanilla flavor and some pleasant black cherry fruit."
Argentina,84.0,12.0,Mendoza,Tilia,"Generic, slightly soapy tropical fruit and cured-meat aromas smell oily. This is not flabby, with soft flavors of melon, papaya and lychee. A mild finish with some bitterness doesn't offer much snap or zest."
US,89.0,28.0,Livermore Valley,Rubino Estates Winery,"Smoky, charred-oak aromas and flavors streak through this otherwise smooth, ripe and moderately fruity wine. It is full bodied and firmly tannic but not coarse."
US,93.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Signorello,"This barrel selection has long been Signorello's best Chardonnay, and it still is. It elevates Napa Valley, not the most natural home to Chardonnay, to its finest expression. Earthy but complex, it has intricate citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, as well as a firm minerality. Drink now."
US,90.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,MacLaren,"Since 2009, the producer has sourced from this site, a relatively warm pocket of the northern reaches of the appellation. Vibrant in red cherry fruit, it's also layered and velvety smooth, with astructure and density that makes it complex and compelling. The fruit dances in blackberry as well as strawberry, with a subtle herbal undertone."
US,95.0,60.0,Stags Leap District,Renteria,"This remarkable Cabernet was grown and produced by a longtime Mexican-American immigrant. It is an extraordinary wine, rich and full-bodied, explosive in sweetly ripe blackberries, cherries and black currants, yet given firmness by a firm minerality that must come from the soil. Defines AndrÃ© Tchelistcheff's description of Stags Leap Cabernets as an iron fist in a velvet glove. Drink now??020."
France,83.0,15.0,Alsace,Pierre Deschamps,"Soft and aromatic, this is a crisp, clean and fruity wine. It has some sweetness (not indicated on the label) with lime and tangy citrus flavors. It's ready to drink."
US,89.0,100.0,Saddle Rock-Malibu,Cielo,"Dried berry, leather, cola, and herb notes show on the nose of this bottling from the mountains between the Conejo Valley and Malibu Coast. The flavors are savory at first?all crushed anise and mint?but grow fruitier as it opens, suggesting dark strawberry, blueberry, vanilla and clove. Quite quaffable."
Italy,88.0,75.0,Barolo,Cascina Chicco,"This wine has an unusual combination of sweet and sour sensations that include ripe plum, sour cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate, hay, dill, sage and leather. It's still very young with nervous acidity and aggressive tannins that need time to tame."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Greco di Tufo,Di Meo,"Elegant, savory and balanced, this opens with delicate orchard fruit, Mediterranean scrub and wet stone scents. The vibrant, ethereal palate delivers lemon, nectarine and pear fruit, buttressed by crisp acidity. A savory mineral note gives it a mouthwatering finish."
US,94.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),No Girls,"Dark in color, this wine offers reserved aromas of smoke, tobacco, red fruit, crÃ¨me de cassis, flowers, exotic spice and funk. The palate is plush and forward but still light on its feet, showing energy and focus. Fruit and savory flavors persist on the finish, demonstrating exquisite balance."
US,91.0,28.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Alma Rosa,"Very tight and Chablis-like in style, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows crisp Asian pear, lemon pith, Pink Lady apple rinds, wet concrete and a touch of petrol on the nose. The palate is light and fresh, with yellow pear, nectarine and a lemon skin-led acidity, possessing all the bones to age with style."
US,93.0,225.0,Napa Valley,Diamond Creek,"From an eight-acre block of the producer's iconic estate, this is a velvety smooth, darkly colored wine, luxuriously structured to age yet deliciously appealing now. Chocolate, blackberry, currant and a leathery, smoky edge combine forcefully on the palate with length and breadth. Drink now through 2023."
US,92.0,40.0,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Barton,"This bottling, which is both a reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd song and an ode to the grape growers, offers vibrant blackberry, slate and vanilla aromas. The palate is ripe and juicy but balanced, with tangy plum skin and dark spice flavors, framed by a chalky tannic structure. It's fruity enough for traditional California Zinfandel fans but complex enough to win converts."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Rosso di Montalcino,San Polo,"San Polo's Rosso di Montalcino offers classic aromas of cherry, black fruit and spice. But it also adds an extra layer of vanilla and sweet spice that makes for a very nice ensemble. It's smooth, rich and spicy on the close."
France,85.0,11.0,Vin de Pays CitÃ© de Carcassonne,Vignobles Sarrail,"A fruity and fragrant selection, with upfront aromas of ripe strawberries, banana and peaches and cream. There's a bit more tension on the palate, with bracing acidity and flavors of small, tart red berries and white cherry."
Canada,87.0,21.0,Okanagan Valley,Tinhorn Creek,"This unusual five-grape blend includes Chardonnay, SÃ©millon, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Muscat. It maintains a sense of focus, with the grassy, herbal character of Sauv Blanc and SÃ©millon commanding most of the attention. It's stiff, woody (rather than oaky) and herbal. Try it with fresh goat cheese."
Italy,85.0,14.0,Venezia,Tenuta Polvaro,"Bright citrus and bitter almond give this a sharp, tonic personality. Pair this easy, food-friendly wine with sushi or Thai food."
US,86.0,19.0,Lodi,Klinker Brick,"An aroma like maple syrup on waffles and similar, sweet-seeming flavors are reminiscent of breakfast, but this will pair well with slow-cooked barbecue. Most of that spicy sweetness comes from oak barrels or add-ins, complementing the full body and light tannins."
US,90.0,58.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Talley,"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Lone Madrone,"One of the first 2014s available, this obscure yet successful blend of 71% Grenache Blanc and 29% AlbariÃ±o invites the nose with vanilla-laced apple custard, orange blossom and baking soda aromas. It's bright on the tight and pithy palate, with bouncy apple cider flavors as well as poached pear and kaffir lime."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Uco Valley,Zuccardi,"Tropical fruit and vanilla-cookie aromas come with a note of nectarine. This feels juicy, racy and citric, with flavors of tangerine and nectarine. Despite having tangy acidity, the wine turns heavy on the finish."
US,95.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,"This Cabernet is a blend of estate and purchased fruit. In a successful year, it rivals Stag's Leap's best wines, including Cask 23, and 2008 was a very successful year. Blended with 2% Merlot, and aged in lots of new French oak, the wine is, in a word, stunning. Rich, flashy blackberry and dark chocolate flavors are anchored by an earthiness suggesting cured olives and dried herbs. Delicious now, this beauty should develop additional complexities throughout the decade."
Spain,86.0,18.0,Rioja,Bodegas Ondalan,"Forced oak is the lead aroma on this clampy, tannic Rioja from a marginal vintage. Pasty oak covers up dried plum and currant flavors. A raw, rubbery, scouring finish tastes dry and woody."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Catalunya,Torres,"This Tempranillo is more traditional than modern. The nose is crisp, with a hint of tomato, clay and dry herbs along with plum and berry aromas. The palate shows proper grip and honest flavors of leafy berry, carob, earth and prune. It's short on the finish but perfectly good overall."
France,90.0,20.0,Graves,ChÃ¢teau Haut Selve,"A rich white wine, its toast character submerged in a generous peach and apricot ripeness. There is an attractive lemon zest acidity to give a bright shot through all the richness. Worth aging 2?? years."
Argentina,82.0,15.0,Mendoza,Finca PasiÃ³n,"Red fruit aromas come with green notes of tomato leaf, oregano and sage. It tastes tangy, with flavors of tobacco and red berry. The finish is stalky and herbal tasting."
US,92.0,38.0,Mendocino Ridge,Spicy Vines,"Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish."
US,85.0,34.0,North Fork of Long Island,Sannino,"A hint of dill lends curious contrast to bright sour-cherry and raspberry flavors in this full-bodied wine. Supple on the palate and framed by the softest of tannins, it finishes briskly with a kick of cranberry acidity."
Argentina,87.0,15.0,Mendoza,Zuccardi,"Jumpy, bright berry and currant aromas come with a scent of wet dog fur. This is fresh but shallow, with simple, lively cherry and plum flavors. On the finish, this is easy and friendly but it evaporates quickly."
France,94.0,150.0,Champagne,Perrier JouÃ«t,"Toasty aromas abound, and the acidity is well integrated with the fruit and biscuit flavors. Pure brioche and ripeness. Ready to drink."
US,88.0,40.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,TondrÃ©,"This is a big, extracted wine, voluptuous with cherry, plum, Dr. Pepper, pomegranate and oak flavors. It has Pinot's silky texture and the delightfully crisp acidity typical to this central part of Monterey County. You might want to cellar it for 3?? years to see if it can mellow out."
US,92.0,65.0,Sonoma Coast,FEL,"This is a robustly built, densely packed and velvety wine with smooth layers of integrated oak. Tannins provide the power and foundation behind its crisp blue fruit and dried herb flavors, seasoned with cola and black pepper spice."
US,88.0,30.0,Dry Creek Valley,Del Carlo Winery,"This is an approachable, affordable wine that impresses on every level. It combines raspberry, vanilla and plum flavors with juicy, moderate acidity and rounded texture, the fruit accented with clove, cedar and bay leaf notes."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Monferrato Bianco,Pico Maccario,"This blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon delivers pretty floral and white-fruit aromas, while the long and linear palate shows restrained fruit flavors punctuated by pear and a hint of mineral."
Argentina,87.0,25.0,Mendoza,Weinert,"Initial rubbery, latex aromas give way to raisin, wet clay, alfalfa and horse hide. The palate has a nice, healthy feel and flavors of berry, green herbs and red-fruit zest. Shows good grab and mouthfeel on the back palate, with a touch of tomato leaf and herbal essence. More traditional in style than many highly extracted Argentine Malbecs."
US,91.0,47.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Demetria,"Demetria's Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah blend has had a good track record over the years, and what do you know, here's another fine offering. While the wine is quite dry, with a good bite of acidity, it has plenty of apparent sweetness, by way of sour raspberry candy, bacon and caramelized oak. Harder to describe is the splendid way it feels in the mouth, so silky, smooth and clean. Drink soon."
US,91.0,26.0,Yakima Valley,Animale,"The aromas start out quite locked up, with notes of purple fruit and flowers. The palate reveals fresh, quite pure aromas, with well-balanced acid and tannins and a finish that lingers."
US,91.0,90.0,Chiles Valley,Conn Creek,"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak."
Italy,86.0,26.0,Sicilia,Gurra di Mare,"Made from a 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Viognier, it features aromas of yellow peach, apricot and a hint of baked bread. The palate is less expressive however, with a thick honey-like consistency but not much flavor."
US,85.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Pull,"This blend of 53% Grenache, 23% Petite Sirah, 20% Syrah and 4% Viognier offers cinnamon spice, red cherry and slight pomegranate on the nose. The palate shows tangy cranberry fruit, a bit of baking spice and a very clay-like minerality and texture."
US,84.0,28.0,Carneros,Roche,"Sharp and gritty in the mouth, with cutting acidity. Despite nice cherry, spice and sandalwood flavors, the texture is too peppery tart."
France,90.0,114.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"This dense wine is still very young. The fruit still needs to express itself in a wine that is broad and ripe. Give this rich wine, with its creamy texture and touches of spice from wood aging, until 2021."
Australia,88.0,14.0,Victoria,Mount Langi Ghiran,"The price is right for this lush, immediately attractive Shiraz from Victoria. Smoky, vanilla-scented oak frames black currant and tobacco flavors that finish soft and velvety. Lacks the depth to age past 2010, but very flattering now. Imported by Epic Wines."
US,86.0,35.0,Rockpile,Mauritson,"Here's a big, rich, lusty Zinfandel, the kind that packs plenty of flavor. It explodes in wild forest raspberry and blackberry fruit, accented with spicy thyme and chamomile tea, while extremely high alcohol gives it heat and a glyceriny sweetness."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Collelceto,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of violet, wild berry and forest floor lead the nose on this easygoing red. The bright straightforward palate shows morello cherry, tangerine zest and a hint of clove framed in bright acidity and supple tannins."
France,89.0,28.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Union Beaujolaise,The wine has delicious acidity as well as lively fruitiness. An attractive mineral texture offers a tangy view of a ripe vintage. Drink this crisp wine now.
France,91.0,20.0,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz,"Evocatively tender notes of Conference pear appear on the nose. The palate is ample with juicy pear and has a generous dollop of residual sweetness. Nonetheless, this is balanced by vigorous lively freshness, leaving a harmonious, rounded, light-footed and elegant wine with a moreish finish."
US,88.0,25.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Hahn,"Light aromas suggest peach and pear. The wine's flavors revolve around a slightly tannic and tart tension, between hard green apple skins and sharp mustard, making for a somewhat angular yet interesting spin on Chardonnay. Ample weight provides a solid mouthfeel, with a medium-length finish."
US,90.0,25.0,Sierra Foothills,Terre Rouge,"Entirely varietal, this Roussanne was whole-cluster fermented and is intense in its mushroomy, woodsy richness and layers of complexity and depth. With a lingering mineral finish, a fine case study in Roussanne's ability to stand out on its own."
US,88.0,25.0,Finger Lakes,McGregor,"Slightly muted tones of black cherry and plum preserves are accented by wet soil, mushroom and coconut in this rustic yet elegant Cabernet Franc. Ripe fruit is contrasted by vibrant acidity, rigid tannins and a pleasant bite of astringency that persists through the finish. Drink now through 2022."
US,95.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Williams Selyem,"One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent. The palate is bright and tangy with acidity, and incredibly complex flavors of wild berries, mushrooms, balsam, cola and Asian spices. It's dramatic now, but will continue to improve for at least 15 years."
France,85.0,12.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau du Bois Chantant,"This wine has certainly been wood aged, the easy fruit well balanced with the layers of wood tannin, which come through in the aftertaste. Ripe, ready to drink."
Spain,90.0,35.0,Rueda,Emina,"Aromas of apple and hay are slightly oily but nice. Bright acidity renders this fresh and not too chunky, while flavors of dry oak, melon and salted apple finish steady, with a hint of lemon. If you are interested in barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is a good place to start."
US,91.0,45.0,Sonoma County,Hidden Ridge,"This wine tests the critic's judgment. Is it just a fruit bomb, bursting with cherries, raspberries and blackberries, enhanced with caramelized oak? Or is it a Cab that needs time? All indications suggest the latter. The tannins are thick and hard, courtesy of the vineyard's high altitude in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the acidity is perfect to protect the wine as it evolves in the bottle. Give it until at least 2017."
US,86.0,28.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"This late-harvest Viognier looks like a still wine as it comes out of the bottle, exploding with honey and wildflowers on the nose. Its fruitiness is restrained somewhat and would stand out paired with a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e?though on its own, the alcohol is overpowering."
US,91.0,95.0,Diamond Mountain District,Raymond,"This 100% varietal wine from the rocky, mountainous appellation offers sizable tannins and robust, smoky leather, black pepper and cola notes. Full-bodied and concentrated with ripe black fruit, it's a long, brawny experience."
Canada,89.0,35.0,Okanagan Valley,Burrowing Owl,"Oaky and full bodied, this features minty and savory highlights, with big scents and flavors of barrel. Tight cassis fruit, streaked with coffee and dark chocolate, finishes with a dusty coating of graphite. Give this at least a couple of hours in a decanter to loosen it up."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Sicilia,Tenuta Gorghi Tondi,"Easy and smooth, this shows bright fruit aromas of cherry and cooked raspberry, with soft layers of spice and tobacco at the back. Pair this with pasta and hearty meat sauce."
Spain,81.0,11.0,Somontano,Bodegas Pirineos,"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart. Mesache means youthful but youth is wasted on the young in this case. Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and the indigenous Parraleta."
France,88.0,16.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de Chambert,"From vineyards at the top of slopes above the river Lot, this balanced wine moves easily between red cherry acidity and dark, young tannins. Still young, the tannic structure needs to mellow and will soften with time. Drink from 2018."
US,94.0,70.0,Willamette Valley,Domaine Serene,"This includes grapes from the winery's Jerusalem Hill vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, in addition to the Dundee Hills sites, hence the more general Willamette Valley designation. It was aged in 65% new French oak for 16 months. It's open and generous, offering bright berry, cherry and red currant fruit matched to defining acids, all set in a fine-tuned frame of new oak. Re-tasted 24 hours after being opened, it remained fresh, dense and satisfying."
Spain,84.0,22.0,Sierra de Salamanca,La Zorra,"Bready, oxidized aromas are imprecise and lacking in fruit. This is a blend of Palomino, Rufete Blanca and Moscatel from Salamanca, which is off the beaten path. A plump but flat palate of yeasty white-fruit flavors lacks zest on a fading finish. Drink now."
France,86.0,22.0,Vin Mousseux,Hospices de Saumur,"Fresh raspberry-flavored sparkling wine, with vivid acidity but also some softness. It has a bright, crisp texture, lively and refreshing. The wine comes from a small parcel next to the Hospices de Saumur."
US,88.0,15.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"Here's a young, lusty, grapey Zinfandel that really gets the tastebuds watering. Crisp acidity stimulates the palate, while rich, dry flavors reward it with an array of briary blackberries, cherries, chocolate, tobacco and spices. Textbook Dry Creek Zinfandel."
US,87.0,16.0,Amador County,Sobon Estate,"Dry and full-bodied, this structured version of Viognier has subtle fruit aromas of melon and peach, flavors accented by oak and vanilla, a firm texture and clean finish. A substantial white wine, it should pair well with seafood, light meat dishes and creamy sauces."
US,89.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Soquel Vineyards,"The best way to understand this wine is to consider a fine Pinot Noir, with its light, silky texture and brisk acidity. Then make it very tannic, and add a smoked meat, bacon note to the cherries and raspberries. With a dry, distinguished finish, it strongly suggests beef dishes, preferably augmented with cheese."
US,91.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Spring Valley Vineyard,"Uriah is Spring Valley's Right Bank-style blend, with Merlot and Cabernet Franc sharing the lead. It's lively and fine-tuned, with a lovely mix of red fruits, spices, and fresh acidity. It spent 21 months in 65% new French oak, to good effect."
France,95.0,85.0,Champagne,Louis Roederer,"This wine is so crisp and piercingly direct in its acidity and minerality. On the palate, apples are fringed with grapefruit and white-currant flavors, with a texture that tight and edgy. Although hints of toast peek through, the wine is still young, so hold and don't drink before 2016."
US,86.0,30.0,Grand Valley,Canyon Wind,"A scent of toasted oak fully wraps the nose, with touches of mint, fruitcake and blackberry underneath. Fine-grained, astringent tannins coat the tongue, and tangy acids gain steam toward the finish."
US,87.0,12.0,Lodi,Gnarly Head,"This is a rich, soft, decadent red, with flavors of dark chocolate, juicy red fruit and a hint of leather. Made from Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot, Malbec, Petite Sirah and a few other red varieties, this is a wine that will delight many. Stock up."
Italy,86.0,36.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Bellarina,"This has toasted oak, espresso and mature dark-skinned berry aromas. The palate dense and packed with prune, blackberry extract and roasted coffee flavors. Raspy tannins leave an abrupt, astringent finish."
US,90.0,13.0,San Bernabe,Noble Vines,"There's nice restraint on the nose of this judiciously priced bottling by the Delicato group, with lemon-lime citrus and slightly green apple flesh on the nose. The wine is strongly textural once sipped, with sour apple, lime peel and riper stone fruit in the background, finishing grippy and clean."
France,92.0,119.0,Puligny-Montrachet,Domaine Faiveley,"Showing bright white fruits shot through with citrus, this ripe wine is intense in its freshness. It is very pure in its character with a great line of acidity. The hints of wood are modest, giving a wine that is all mineral fruitiness. Drink from 2018."
US,87.0,25.0,Napa Valley,St. SupÃ©ry,"Clean and crisp, this Sauvignon Blanc-SÃ©millon blend has flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and spices. It's technically dry, but finishes with honeysuckle sweetness."
US,87.0,28.0,Carneros,Schug,"Bright acidity gives the tangerine and citron flavors of this Chardonnay a bite. It's very dry, clean and minerally, and finishes with a mouthwatering scour."
Italy,87.0,49.0,Toscana,Fattoria Montellori,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, the nose reveals red berry and French oak aromas, while the palate offers unripe strawberry, clove and cedar. Rather astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish."
France,88.0,23.0,Sancerre,Xavier Flouret,"The Xavier Flouret brand covers the world, but its Sancerre is always among its most consistent. It is balanced, fruity and only lightly herbaceous. Touches of white currants add to the fruitiness of this ready-to-drink wine."
US,94.0,70.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"From the steepest, east-facing block of the estate vineyard, given 15% whole-cluster fermentation, this is a dense, brooding wine, spicy and concentrated in blueberry and black cherry. It has a tenacity of earthiness that never lets go, lingering on the full-bodied palate for days. Drink now through 2023."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau le Gardera,Ripe fruit aromas give this wine its full-bodied feel. It has acidity and spicy tannins while the rich fruit theme continues. It should develop well and be ready from 2018.
Italy,87.0,12.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Bianca Vigna,"A great deal at this price point, this vintage-dated Italian sparkler opens with steely bubbles and tightly focused aromas of white peppercorn, white peach citrus and honey. It's considerable intensity helps drive it forward over the palate."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Soave Classico,Bolla,"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit, pressed flower and a whiff of citrus zest take center stage on this enjoyable white. The bright palate offers golden apple and pear while a note of bitter almond closes the finish."
US,94.0,45.0,Ribbon Ridge,Styring,"The totally delicious fruit offers immense flavors of black cherries and cassis, along with streaks of cola, coffee and chocolate syrup. It's a luscious, beautifully balanced wine with a long and thoroughly delicious finish."
Spain,87.0,20.0,Rioja,Baron De Ley,"This is smooth and smells like true Rioja with its vanilla, dill and raspberry aromas. It feels fresh and healthy, but a little choppy and gritty, and it tastes of cherry, vanilla, tobacco and leafy herb."
US,89.0,40.0,Finger Lakes,Ravines,"Notes of hazelnut and freshly baked brioche add depth and a sense of maturity to fresher aromas of apple and pear on this sparkling wine. Made from equal proportions Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's bright and brisk with acidity and penetrating flavors of apple and lime. Finishes with a lingering hint of cookie crumbs."
US,87.0,28.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Refugio Ranch,"An intriguing waxy character shows strongly on the nose of this bottling, with ripe lime and green-apple aromas as well. The flavors are light and delicate, with a touch of pomelo that grows with patience into more tropical yet still restrained papaya and bubblegum elements."
Spain,90.0,26.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de Murrieta,"Earthy, dry aromas of plum and cherry come with notes of vanilla, herbs, tobacco and leather. This feels fresh, acidic and generally well balanced. Flavors of spiced plum and berry are riper than many 2008s from Rioja, while a finish with tobacco and leathery flavors is solid and fairly long. Drink through 2020."
US,94.0,625.0,Napa Valley,Yao Ming,"As imposing as the athlete himself, this is an impressive wine from the get-go, high in acidity and the resulting bright cassis and red berry fruit. It's nuanced in pretty ways, with peppercorn, herb and chalky tannins. Lingering on the palate, the structure suggests significant aging potential; enjoy from 2021??024."
US,89.0,18.0,Columbia Gorge (OR),Sineann,"This Oak Ridge bottling is rich and unctuous. Scents and flavors of rose petals mingle with a lightly soapy, oily, broad midpalate that floats along on a bed of flowers, stone fruits, toast, hazelnuts, caramel and stone. A splash of everything, but it comes together in a seductive, open framework with just enough acid to support it."
US,87.0,24.0,Redwood Valley,Claudia Springs,"Made from grapes sourced from an inland Mendocino County appellation, this is at first forceful, tannic and dusty, with strong red-berry and blueberry flavors. A tad decadent, it settles down nicely in the glass."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,La Mormoraia,"Aromas of white spring flower, oak-driven vanilla and a whiff of white stone fruit lead the nose. The oak sensations follow through the somewhat lean palate, along with pear and a confectionery note. It closes on a note of bitter almond."
Canada,92.0,85.0,Okanagan Valley,Le Vieux Pin,"Steely and compact, this rather reluctantly opens to reveal subtle complexity. The mix of tart blueberry and blackberry fruit is accompanied by scents of cured meat, menthol and garrigue. It spent 18 months in a mix of barrels and puncheons, yielding a pleasant finishing impression of cedar. Decant this for at least an hour or two."
US,85.0,40.0,Willamette Valley,Kramer,"This special selection is already showing some brick around the rim and seems to be aging rapidly. The flavors are mostly herb and root, sassafras and beet root in particular, with the fruit leaning toward Dr. Pepper soda."
Italy,84.0,14.0,Veneto,Villa Cornaro,"This is one of those fun, easygoing Italian Pinot Grigios that tastes great on a hot summer afternoon. The wine is crisp, light and lean with simple endnotes of citrus and melon."
US,86.0,11.0,California,Thornton,"The lightest of the Thornton lineup marches to the beat of a different drummer. Dominated by Muscat Canelli, the aromas suggest ripe pears, buttered cinnamon toast and candied orange peel, but it?s not really sweet. In fact, it?s just barely off-dry, with wonderfully rich flavors. It finishes a little sugary, which makes it cloying, but this is a minor criticism. All in all, it?s good, unconventional stuff."
US,92.0,24.0,Sonoma Coast,Lusso Della Terra,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony."
US,88.0,14.0,Mendocino-Lake,Bonterra,"This is hard to resist, a crisp, easy sipper that's gentle on the wallet and bright with sweet jasmine aromatics. On the palate expect refreshing Mandarin orange and lemon zest flavors. It's a clean, crisp wine made from organic grapes, 52% of which hail from Lake, the rest from Mendocino County."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,Bodega Cuarto Dominio,"Savory, spicy, minty aromas are rustic and rooty. This feels big and broad, with a fair amount of body weight. Flavors of savory berry and leather filter into a creamy, full finish with a residual saline flavor."
US,85.0,10.0,California,DC Flynt MW Selections,"This is a softly delicious red wine. It's strong and jammy in raspberries, cherries and milk chocolate, and is a little sweet, with a spicy finish. Nice barbecue wine. Mainly Zinfandel, with Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot and a few others."
US,91.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Davis Family,"Soft, silky and made in a delicate style, Horseshoe is all about forested earth, black tea and truffle, a delicate lining of orange peel accented in the background. The tannins are well managed and subtle, with the right amount of oak letting the minerality of the wine speak softly but surely."
US,92.0,75.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),18401 Cellars,"This is the inaugural release from this Oregon-based winery, with the fruit coming from Loess and Seven Hills vineyards. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (54%), Merlot (38%) and Petit Verdot, it offers laromas of pencil box, high-toned flowers, bittersweet chocolate, herbs and barrel spices. The flavors show depth and intensity as well as exquisite balance and length."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Rioja,Larchago,"Minerally plum and raspberry aromas come with latex and Band-Aid notes. This feels tannic, loud and high in acidity. Rubber and iodine flavors come in front of plum and raspberry fruit, while the finish is juicy and fresh, but drawing."
US,87.0,30.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Zerba Cellars,"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity."
France,93.0,68.0,Cahors,Jean-Luc BaldÃ¨s,"Named after Roman emperor Probus, who allowed the replanting of vines in France, this finely mature wine is smooth, with a dry core. That structure supports secondary flavors and spice, which add to its juicy acidity and overall richness. Drink now."
US,91.0,60.0,McMinnville,Hyland,"Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate. Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate."
Argentina,90.0,20.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Familia Cassone,"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete."
Italy,92.0,69.0,Barbaresco,Pelissero,"Tulin opens with thick concentration and a dark, brooding appearance. The aromas are intense and extremely inviting and recall blackberry, cherry, eucalyptus leaf, cola, underbrush and licorice. The thickness and density in the mouth creates a big, satisfying sensation and the wine ends with a soft, plush finish. Drink after 2015."
Italy,89.0,22.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"Beautifully fragrant and breezy with summer aromas of white flower, green herb and exotic fruit, here is the perfect summer sipping wine. Pair this Sauvignon with spaghetti with vongole and freshly chopped parsley."
Italy,84.0,13.0,Valpolicella Classico,Nicolis,"This edition of Nicolis' base Valpolicella Classico wine shows more heft and greater concentration of cherry fruit. Background tones include mocha, dried mint and candy cough drop."
US,85.0,15.0,Lodi,Noble Vines,"This is a Cab made unabashedly to appeal to a broad range of palates. It's medium in weight and texture with layers of vanilla and cherry that are persistent enough to stand up to all kinds of food. A perfect burger wine, especially for a crowd."
US,87.0,26.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pondera,"Aromas of vanilla, spice box, raspberry, dill and wood spice are followed by medium-bodied cherry flavors that linger."
Italy,92.0,61.0,Toscana,Villa Cafaggio,"This Cab offers big blackberry aromas, brown sugar, dark concentration and a brooding disposition. It's plush and modern, and a true bruiser, with firm tannins and opulent flavors of toast and plum. Ready to drink."
US,89.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Jamieson Ranch,"A very nice wine, showcasing the Napa style of lush, plush opulence. It's softly tannic, with ripe blackberry, raspberry, mocha and cedar flavors. Not an ager?drink by 2015."
Italy,93.0,133.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Donatella Cinelli Colombini,"Truffle, leather, scorched earth, menthol and steeped plum aromas lead the way on this full-bodied red. The brawny palate offers dried black cherry steeped in spirits, blackberry confiture, licorice, cinnamon and mocha alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish. Give it a few more years to fully come together. Drink 2018??026."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Toscana,Ruffino,"A flashy, modern-style wine, Modus takes traditional Tuscan flavors of leather and tobacco, dresses them up with cassis, vanilla and toast and wraps all that in a cocoon of lush, supple tannins. An immediately approachable blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot."
Italy,88.0,32.0,Toscana,I Giusti e Zanza,"Aromas of ripe, dark-skinned berry and crushed violet emerge from this vibrant blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese. The  savory palate doles out black cherries and black currants accented with notes of toast and ground pepper. It's already accessible and made to be enjoyed young."
US,92.0,29.0,Monterey,Metz Road,"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character."
France,90.0,72.0,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger,"With time, fresh rose petals merge into heady Turkish delight notes on the nose. This is full-on Gewurztraminer with all the bells and whistles: utterly decadent rose water and honeysuckle notes are submerged in rich, indulgent sweetness. This is perfumed and full-on: a super-charged varietal expression with rich, powdery layers of rose, honey and caramel."
US,89.0,30.0,Willamette Valley,Bethel Heights,"Fine aromas of sour cherry, violets and spice open this light-bodied but nicely textured wine. Very clean cherry fruit shines on the palate, and there is very good fruit-to-acid balance here. Has a lengthy finish with dry cherry flavors, a mineral note and even tannins. Focused and attractive already, it will age well for two or three years."
Spain,88.0,16.0,Montilla-Moriles,Garcia Hermanos,"Heavyweight aromas of molasses and honey are friendly but flat. A dry, drawing palate holds nutty, salty walnut flavors that run only so deep before bottoming out. A tight, basic finish doesn't waver."
US,92.0,50.0,Ribbon Ridge,Chehalem,"Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish."
US,89.0,25.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Sextant,"Familiar aromas of plum, mulberry, clove and slate show on the nose of this appellation blend by the Paso Robles-based winery. There is decent tension on the sip, where cooked cranberry and strawberry meet with a backbone of allspice and nutmeg as well as bittersweet chocolate."
US,85.0,11.0,California,Dante,"This tastes like it could be anything from Chardonnay to Sauvignon Blanc to Grenache Blanc, but it's rich in honey, orange and buttered toastflavors. It's seems a little sweet, but it has a good cut of acidity."
France,90.0,14.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Houchart,"With really ripe fruit and juicy black flavors, this is a rounded, warm wine. It tastes of sun, although there is also something more seriously structured about it. Acidity gives freshness, while the tannic structure suggests further aging. Drink now, but better in 2015."
US,89.0,45.0,St. Helena,David Fulton,"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness."
US,87.0,39.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Byington,"Coming from a vineyard 2,100 feet high in the Santa Cruz Mountains, this is quite light in color, with a fruit-punch aroma alongside graphite, vanilla and French toast. The easy-drinking flavors are tart and straightforward."
US,92.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Flora Springs,"A lovely wine, soft and charming, but far from simple. Although it has complex layers of cherries, blackberries, cassis and cedar, it also shows a fine structure of ripe, smooth tannins and supporting acidity. Drink now??015 while it's fresh and forward."
France,93.0,46.0,Chablis,William FÃ¨vre,"This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years."
Argentina,89.0,20.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Rooty, earthy berry aromas include a hint of clove. This feels full and chewy, with broad shoulders and firm tannins. Herbal blackberry flavors come with tea and spice notes. It is stocky and woody on a finish that tastes like campfire smoke."
France,89.0,31.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Bret Brothers,"This is a rich, fruity wine that has a definite minerally character. The chalky texture is laced with lemon and apricot flavors, leading to a crisp, tight finish."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Monteregio di Massa Marittima,Rocca di Montemassi,"Sassabruna is a Sangiovese-based wine with an added component of Syrah and Merlot that adds spice, consistency and fruitiness. Aromas here include red cherry, leather, black berry and vanilla bean."
Argentina,86.0,13.0,Mendoza,Maipe,"Red berry, sweet cherry and ripe plum aromas come with a touch of leather. The palate feels a bit sharp and acidic, with tangy, juicy flavors of plum and wild berry as well as some stalkiness. Cleansing and long on the finish thanks to high acidity."
Italy,87.0,85.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Siro Pacenti,"Toasted aromas come along with fragrances of espresso, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate delivers raw red cherry layered with mocha and coffee bean alongside astringent wood tannins that generate a drying, bitter finish."
US,91.0,28.0,Monterey,Cambiata,"Another successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time. Interesting as an alternative to a big Zinfandel or Petite Sirah."
US,91.0,33.0,Napa Valley,Hendry,"Lightly textured, this is an ethereal and sublime wine. Dark brick red in color but feathery on the palate, it offes earthy cherry around a core of subtle spice."
US,88.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Left Coast Cellars,"Ripe pear fruit introduces a full-bodied Pinot Gris, and carries it through a satisfying finish. It's fruit all the way, dusted with a little taste of cinnamon spice."
US,87.0,20.0,Alexander Valley,Folie Ã  Deux,"This is immediately attractive in blackberry, cherry and red currant flavors, with a subtle coating of smoky oak. With plenty of elegance, it's wonderful for drinking now. It should be relatively easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases in circulation."
Italy,87.0,25.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Peter Zemmer,"Cortinie Bianco opens with impressive intensity and lasting aromas of peach cobbler, vanilla cream and preserved peaches. It follows with a smooth, dense texture in the mouth."
US,93.0,85.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"The 2010 Widowmaker shows a bit more fruit, less funk than usual. It's a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, plums and figs, along with clean earth, green tea and a hint of chocolate. The tannins are smooth and the flavors linger gracefully and slowly fade through the finish."
Italy,90.0,85.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Cordella,"Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass. The firmly structured palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, vanilla and an earthy hint of game while assertive, close-grained tannins provide support. Give it a few years for the tannins to relax then enjoy. Drink 2019??023."
US,92.0,70.0,St. Helena,Trinchero,"Made in a ripe, oaky style, this 100% Cabernet has powerful blackberry and cassis flavors that are a little warm. Its 95% new French oak is evident in the smoke, vanilla, toast and caramel notes. It's a very tannic wine that locks down the palate with dry astringency. All indications suggest the cellar. Give it at least eight years."
France,87.0,18.0,Morgon,Vignobles Bulliat,"This wine is all bright cherry fruit with juicy acidity and a jammy character. It's delicious now, with its light tannins and bright raspberry aftertaste. Drink now."
US,89.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Crest,"Hand harvested from Block 15 of StoneTree Vineyard with a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon from Block 14 (10%), it brings notes of coffee, cocoa and plum. The fruit flavors are elegant in style accented by barrel notes and mouthwatering acids. It doesn't seem to have fully reached its potential yet, with the tannins bringing a slightly gritty feel."
US,94.0,36.0,Calaveras County,Prospect 772,"An incredibly concentrated, silky blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Nothing shy about this wine, inspired as it is by the great Chateauneuf-du-Papes and yet undoubtedly Californian. Make that mountain Californian. With baked cherry fruit and baking spices throughout and serious grip and weight, this is one heady and delicious wine."
Argentina,89.0,22.0,Agrelo,Finca Decero,"Aromas of asphalt and grilled steak accent berry and cassis scents. This hits hard on the palate, with no mercy to the tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis come with notes of desert sage and chocolate. Drilling tannins last through the finish. Drink through 2020."
US,97.0,90.0,Russian River Valley,Arista,"Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine."
US,91.0,80.0,Anderson Valley,Goldeneye,"This is a full-bodied Pinot Noir, showing lavish new-oak aromas and rich, ripe fruit flavors. Medium-deep ruby in tone, it has aromas suggesting vanilla, toasted oak and nutmeg, with a hint of rhubarb. Flavors recall cherry and blackberry. Gradually the oak flavors recede and the lively fruit character comes out, lingering on the finish."
Italy,93.0,29.0,Eloro,Curto,"A medley of pretty aromas, including blue flower, perfumed berry, carob and Mediterranean herb all mingle in the glass. On the smooth, almost creamy palate, savory notes of clove, orange zest, white pepper and licorice add depth to the juicy blackberry core, while polished tannins provide the framework."
Italy,87.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Donatella Cinelli Colombini,"This conveys aromas of mature dark fruit and leafy underbrush. The firm palate displays stewed plum, ground pepper and a hint of dried sage alongside extremely astringent tannins that cut short the finish. Tried twice with the same notes."
US,90.0,18.0,Lodi,Uvaggio,"Herbaceous aromas and bright citrus flavors give an almost-electric charge to this light-bodied, crisp and appetizing wine. Aromas of snap peas, parsley and fresh-cut grass lead to lemon and grapefruit flavors and a tingly mouthfeel. It's a perfect summer-to-fall drink."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Extremadura,ViÃ±a Santa Marina,"Earthy, rubbery berry aromas are potent. So is the palate, which is demanding and bouncy but also a bit rough. Pinched, herbal plum and tomato flavors are rustic in style and reflect Extremedura's sunny, dry terroir. This wine is interesting and moderately complex."
US,87.0,35.0,McMinnville,Yamhill Valley,"The winery's reserve bottling is consistent in terms of flavor and style, with the estate 2009 just a bit deeper in color and body. Still tight, with green tea flavors in the tannins leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste."
US,88.0,48.0,Dundee Hills,Francis Tannahill,"This opens with strong scents and flavors of stem and herb, and shows some potent tannins as well. Then along comes chewy cherry fruit, substantial and somewhat in hiding. Green tea, earth and a hint of baking spices suggest that further aging will help to pull it all together."
Italy,94.0,130.0,Toscana,Monteverro,"Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a RhÃ´ne-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting."
US,85.0,13.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sagelands,"This wine seems to show some of the effects of the cool 2010 growing season, where ripeness and botrytis presented issues in some areas. Notes of tobacco, ash and orange peel surround a sweet cherry core accented by grainy tannins."
Australia,86.0,28.0,McLaren Vale,Wirra Wirra,"Loaded with earthy espresso and charred wood, this full-bodied Shiraz makes for a chunky mouthful of wine. Black pepper, leather and dried spices round out the flavors. ?J.C."
Italy,93.0,45.0,Piemonte,Colombo,"Structured and refined, this opens with aromas of mature berry, a hint of leather, savory herb and cooking spice. The focused palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, black pepper and licorice alongside youthfully austere tannins. Give this time to wind down and develop complexity. Drink 2018??024."
US,90.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,McCrea,"This is the third year McCrea has made an Elerding Chardonnay, fermented on wild yeasts in stainless tanks, then aged sur lie in fairly neutral oak. Complex, textured and loaded with banana and butterscotch flavors, it's a rich wine that retains enough elegance to go down easily with food."
France,84.0,15.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Clos Bourbon,"The wine is soft, just juicy and with little in the way of concentration. Barrel-aged for 12 months in one-third new oak, it is attractive and ready to drink now. Vines are planted on limestone and clay above limestone and iron schist subsoil."
Argentina,86.0,10.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Tight, snappy aromas of citric red fruit and lemon peel set up a driving, tight palate with brambly berry, spice and herbal flavors. This shows chocolaty oak on the finish and juicy acidity that ensures freshness and long-lasting flavor."
Argentina,84.0,8.0,Mendoza,Santa Julia,"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. Keep in mind the price and young vintage when drinking."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Franciacorta,Villa,"Cuvette Brut has a beautiful floral fragrance of white and yellow flowers, baked bread and Alpine herbs. The elegantly sparkling palate delivers citrus fruit layered with sage and rosemary. The wine's creamy texture is supported by crisp acidity."
US,92.0,39.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Soquel Vineyards,"From what's becoming one of the most heralded vineyards in the region, this bottling shows wet cement, baked plums, blackberry, thyme and black sage on the nose. Boysenberry fruit comes first on the sip, followed by tart orange peel, a touch of green olive and more fresh thyme flavors."
France,87.0,25.0,Chablis,Domaine Louis Moreau,"A light approach to Chablis, this brings out crisp fruitiness, attractive acidity, apple flavors and a touch of steeliness. With its creamy, ripe aftertaste, the wine is ready to drink."
Italy,86.0,21.0,Alto Adige,Tiefenbrunner,"This wine from the Tiefenbrunner estate at Castel Turmhof is a lively, crisp, fresh style of wine, with flavors of green peppers and mint, and good acidity."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Aglianico del Beneventano,Villa Matilde,"Fruity aromas of blackberry and red forest fruit take a back seat to penetrating oak-driven notes of cedar and vanilla, although the end result is not unbalanced. You'll also detect hints of asphalt, licorice and plum delivered over smoky, dusty tannins and long persistency."
Italy,91.0,59.0,Sforzato di Valtellina,Caven,"This opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, blue flowers, oak and baked plum. The palate offers dried cherries, figs, nutmeg, tobacco and anisette alongside assertive but polished tannins. Drink through 2020."
US,87.0,30.0,Livermore Valley,Concannon,"The Mother Vine Cabernet is drinking soft and easy now, with gentle tannins framing slightly herbaceous blackberry and black cherry flavors, touched with smoky oak. It feels like a wine you want to age, although the softness suggests it won't for long."
Argentina,84.0,16.0,Mendoza,Chakras,"Rubbery stewy berry aromas give way to a pinched-feeling palate. This tastes of salty roasted plum and it stays that way on a dense, chewy, meaty finish."
US,84.0,30.0,Paso Robles,B&E;,"Pizza, burgers and other everyday foods that forgive rusticity are what to drink with this ripe, highish alcohol wine. It offers typical warm climate California flavors of black cherry jam and mocha."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Chianti Classico,Villa Calcinaia,"This soft, plummy expression of Chianti Classico shows ripe black fruit and roasted coffee bean aromas that carry over to the palate. Thanks to its tame acidity and round tannins, this is perfect to drink young."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Chianti Classico,Castelli del Grevepesa,"This opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, leather, game, dark berry and graphite. The firm palate offers up juicy blackberry, dried black cherry, notes of grilled porcini, peppercorn, thyme and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a licorice note. Hold for complexity. Drink 2016??022."
France,86.0,19.0,Alsace,Antoine MoltÃ¨s & Fils,"A subdued nose of earth leads to an off-dry palate with a core of ripe, yellow plums framed by pithy citrus. It is pith rather than freshness that defines this rounded wine."
Italy,88.0,26.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Bersano,"This opens with spiced blueberry, red plum and tilled earth aromas while the medium-bodied palate doles out blackberry, black cherry and clove flavors. Fine-grained tannins and firm acidity provide support. Drink through 2020."
US,91.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Barrister,"The fruit for this excellent Cabernet Franc is sourced from wide-ranging vineyards throughout the Yakima, Columbia and Walla Walla valleys. Aged 18 months in a mix of French, American and Hungarian oak, it is the most accessible of the new red wine releases from Barrister. The tart red fruits are coated with creamy caramel and pretty toast notes, and it sails like clean silk into a long, smooth, buttery finish."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Toscana,Ceralti,"This blend of Chardonnay and GewÃ¼rztraminer opens with pungent aromas of peppermint, dried apricot and caramel candy. Loads of honey and yellow fruit flavors follow on the palate, backed by a rich, almost chewy, consistency."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau la Freynelle,"The wine, unusually 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is ripe and juicy with some smoky tannins in support. It has a finely perfumed character although touches of extraction give it a bitter edge. That should blow by, leaving an attractive fruity wine."
Italy,93.0,92.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Le Salette,"Alluring aromas of exotic spice, purple flower, dark-skinned berry and a balsamic note lead the nose. The concentrated palate delivers dried cherry, ripe plum, mint, licorice and a hint of game alongside velvety tannins that wrap around the finish. It nicely balances weight and finesse."
Australia,86.0,60.0,Padthaway,Two Hands,"High-toned on the nose, coming close to a hint of mail polish, which detracts slightly from the flavors of stewed berries and dark chocolate. It's full-bodied and round, leaving an almost confected impression on the palate."
Italy,90.0,48.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Nardone,"Ripe fruit tones of raspberry jam and blackberry jelly open the bouquet giving this Brunello a plump, sun-kissed personality. It shows a dark garnet color in the glass and has flavors of toasted espresso bean, tobacco, leather and spice with aromatic vanilla endnotes."
US,92.0,75.0,Calistoga,Turnbull,"The extra heat of Calistoga shows in this wine's softness, which limits its ageability. On the other hand, it's supremely ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast and caramel. Drink now??015."
US,92.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma Coast Vineyards,"An intriguing Pinot Noir that shows the possibilities of this cool-climate, southwestern Sonoma region. The wine has been well-oaked, but it's powerful enough to carry that coating of caramel and char, with a massive palate explosion of purÃ©ed ripe cherries, red currants and sweet rhubarb pie. Delicious now with decanting, and should do interesting things over the next six years."
Italy,88.0,21.0,Collio,Isidoro Polencic,"Vibrant and elegant, this opens with scents of citrus blossom, Golden Delicious apple and a whiff of herb. The bright palate offers tangerine zest, mineral hint of almond alongside bright acidity."
US,90.0,28.0,Fiddletown,Easton,"The texture stands out on this dry, balanced wine. It's all velvet and silk in the mouth, almost like Pinot Noir, but everything else screams Zinfandel. The flavors are wild and exuberant, of innumerable wild berries, pepper, licorice and sweet, smoky bacon. Should develop over the next four years."
France,91.0,54.0,Champagne,Vincent Couche,"With vineyards in the southern vineyards of the Aube, Vincent Couche makes a rich style of Champagne. This 2002 vintage, now maturing well, is ripe?almost opulent?in character. Its peach and apricot flavors shine at the fore, extended on the palate with a brisk, nervy texture."
US,85.0,32.0,Russian River Valley,Orsi Family Vineyards,A sourness of bitter black tea overtakes a shyness of fruit in this light-bodied wine that holds on to its tannin with tenacity.
Italy,90.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Fattoria Poggerino,"Blue iris, violet and wild berry aromas waft out of the glass of this pure expression of Sangiovese. The structured but still easy-drinking palate doles out juicy black cherry, clove, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, polished tannins. The warmth of alcohol closes the finish but doesn't throw off the balance."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"Shades of smoke, dried herbs and nut skins add savory tones to this dry Riesling. The palate builds intensity on the midpalate with layers of fresh apple, lime skin and underripe stone fruit, bolstered by sprightly tangerine-laced acidity."
Italy,91.0,40.0,Barolo,Monchiero,"This opens with some funky, earthy aromas that soon blow off to reveal scents of leather, truffle, eucalyptus, berry and meat juices. The palate shows dark cherry, raspberry, pipe tobacco and balsamic notes and big, ripe tannins. This reflects the forward vintage, so drink now."
US,91.0,22.0,Anderson Valley,Lazy Creek,"This beautifully balanced, flavorful wine combines vivid watermelon and canteloupe flavors with medium body, a rich texture and lingering finish. It has great concentration without being heavy."
US,90.0,90.0,Napa Valley,B Cellars,"This blends 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Petite Verdot, the Cabernet hailing from vineyards such as To Kalon and Dr. Crane. This wine is defined by its ripeness, a high-octane expression of coconut and soy with a syrupy concentration of blackberry and cherry that explodes with richness on the palate."
Australia,94.0,95.0,Yarra Valley,Yarra Yering,"Dry Red No. 2 is virtually all Shiraz, though small amounts of Viognier, Marsanne and Mataro are often included. The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance."
US,93.0,58.0,Napa Valley,Chateau Montelena,"This is a dreamy creamy white founded in stony mineral and juicy acidity that shows a mix of baked apple, pineapple and melon. A tease of green olive provides a briny, salty edge to its tense balance. A lingering hint of vanilla oak figures prominently on the lengthy floral finish."
US,91.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Bomb,"Smooth and silky, this seductive wine is absolutely loaded with flavors of cherry and chocolate. It's irresistible, and probably at or near its peak drinking window, as it affords maximum pleasure in a luscious, palate-coating style."
France,88.0,14.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Ricaud,"The wine is soft, ripe and fruity with fine tannins and plenty of red-berry fruit flavors. Structured and spicy, it will develop well into a concentrated ripe wine. Jean-Michel Baudet's Blaye estate vineyards were the first to be certified sustainable by Terra Vitis. Drink from 2018."
US,88.0,50.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mounts,"Referring to the old-time pronunciation of this RhÃ´ne red in California, this wine is awash in flavors of baked plum, maple syrup and dried cherry, akin to raisin cake. The ripeness and rusticity are wrapped in tight, firm tannins that grip on the finish."
US,86.0,15.0,Leelanau Peninsula,Shady Lane,"Citrus, orchard blossoms and sea-spray aromas are lively and focused, with an almond-skin note lingering in the background. The juicy, racy, off-dry palate brings to mind talc-dusted red apple and quince, with a toasty, leesy finish."
US,84.0,17.0,North Coast,Chasing Lions,"Powerfully intoxicating in aroma, this North Coast Cab turns slightly thin and tannic upon tasting, with a melange of herb and coffee flavor."
Italy,83.0,19.0,Sicilia,Cambria,"This oak-aged Chardonnay opens with aromas of candied fruit and butterscotch. The bouquet presents oxidized aromas, with creamy yellow-fruit and vanilla bean flavors."
US,87.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Thirsty Owl Wine Company,"Whiffs of freshly pressed apples and peaches entice on this brisk, easy-drinking wine. Refreshing on the palate, it has a hint of minerality that lingers on the finish."
US,87.0,38.0,Oregon,Le Cadeau,"Rhubarb and cranberry fruit, along with a touch of red apple suggests minimal ripening. It's a tangy, pleasant wine, light and optimal for near-term drinking with simple poultry dishes."
France,90.0,30.0,Saint-Joseph,E. Guigal,"Aged in a combination of one- and two-year-old oak and stainless steel, Guigal's 2007 Saint-Joseph is round in the mouth yet minerally at the same time, with graphite notes supporting the voluminous pear and melon fruit, right through the lengthy finish."
US,91.0,50.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brave & Maiden,"This new project by a former White House videographer recently enlisted Paul Hobbs as a consultant. The promise is already apparent in this wine, with aromas of cedar, cherry extract and pleasant green-pepper elements. Spicy black pepper leads the palate, which finds ripeness in black cherry and balance with leather and coffee."
Canada,91.0,95.0,Niagara Peninsula,Peller,"A direct and appealing wine, with notes of wild strawberry, wet stone, cherry and cranberry. It's fruity and concentrated while still retaining lightness of expression. Drawn out fruit flavors linger on the finish."
US,90.0,34.0,Oregon,Lumos,"This well-aged release, from one of Oregon's premier vineyards, is soft and approachable, well-rounded with lovely plum and black cherry fruit holding down the center. Barrel aging adds baking spices to liven up the finish."
France,91.0,35.0,Alsace,Domaine Weinbach,"A beautifully balanced wine, expressing a certain sweetness, this has a great line of acidity. It's full bodied, ripe and packed with spice and fruit, while remaining elegant and impressive."
US,91.0,22.0,Central Coast,Malene Wines,"Light pink in color, this wine offers laser-sharp, zesty aromas, with pink limeade, pink grapefruit and crushed white-rock scents. There's lots of life to the palate, where a cement minerality unites ripe flavors of watermelon, tart nectarine, white peach and strawberry."
US,89.0,130.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gypsy Canyon,"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla. Could be a little more focused and intense, but very fine, although it calls for a certain appreciation of this oxidative quality."
Italy,90.0,29.0,Chianti,Pietralta,"Underbrush, violet, woodland berry and Mediterranean herb aromas lead the nose of this savory wine. The firm palate delivers ripe wild cherry, black currant, mint and orange peel alongside polished tannins. A balsamic note accents the finish. Enjoy through 2017."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gamache,"Brooding aromas of coffee, vanilla and herbs lead to elegantly styled fruit flavors that taper toward the finish."
US,91.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Hertelendy,"Chappellet winemaker Phillip Corallo-Titus helps make this wine, a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec. While possessing a sizable tannin structure it remains balanced and elegant in cedar, pencil shavings, tart cranberry and cassis. It's rich and velvety."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,"LamÃ¹ri shows a food friendly side of Nero d'Avola that would pair with veal, pork or roasted turkey. The bouquet is redolent of cherry cola, forest fruit, ginger and toasted nut. Subtle notes of smoke and spice appear on the finish."
Argentina,91.0,100.0,Mendoza,TintoNegro,"Boysenberry and raspberry aromas are not simply dark, ripe and macho, but instead show herbal accents along with floral notes and cardamom. This is old vines Malbec with particular flavors of herbal, brushy berry and plum. On the finish, oaky spice, toast and coffee flavors keep the momentum going. Drink through 2021."
US,85.0,34.0,Rogue Valley,Folin Cellars,"Made up of equal parts Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre with the balance Grenache, this has notes of burnt embers and smoked meat. Though only 20% new oak, the wood still seems at the fore with notes of sawdust and toast that distract."
France,87.0,17.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de Gaudou,"The simplest and fruitiest of the Cahors made at Gaudou, this is still a structured wine that has some firm, very young tannins that need to round out. Plenty of fruity, fresh black-currant flavor is cut by crisp acidity. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2016."
France,84.0,20.0,Vin Mousseux,Barton & Guestier,"A sweet sparkling wine that is fresh and clean, this comes from the south of France. The light, crisp character with some acidity leaves a fresh aftertaste. This is a new release from Barton & Gustier."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Puglia,Amastuola,"Bold and full bodied, this offers aromas of steeped plum, prune, clove and blue flower. The concentrated, savory palate doles out mature blackberry, raisin, clove and licorice. Big but velvety tannins and just enough freshness give this a surprisingly drinkable quality that belies its heft."
US,91.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),JM Cellars,"The best blend from JM Cellars is Tre Fanciulli, here composed of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, and 14% Syrah. You'll find pleasing strawberry and Bing cherry fruit, along with claret-like structure and nicely applied cinnamon and baking spice accents. It could almost fool you into thinking you were drinking an excellent Dry Creek Zinfandel."
US,94.0,50.0,Anderson Valley,Expression 39,"An earthy but fruit-drenched character makes this wine an enchanting and multi-layered marvel. The aromas are spicy and savory, recalling clove, raspberry and rhubarb, while the flavors echo just-ripe black cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg without over-reaching. The texture is warm and velvety, with a finish that lingers on the verge of sweetness."
Spain,85.0,29.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Vitis Terrarum,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ??3, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired."
Spain,88.0,16.0,Ribera del Duero,Tineta,"Initially, this smells horsey, minty and not entirely clean or clear. A full chunky but clumsy palate is home to dark toasty flavors of clove and spice, while fruit notes are secondary. Barrel-driven mint, spice and clove flavors dominate the finish."
France,89.0,50.0,Champagne,GÃ©rard Loriot,"From the heart of the Marne Valley, this 100% Pinot Meunier bottling is ripe and yeasty. It has a rich, soft character and hints of toast from the 30% reserve wine in the blend. Balanced dosage gives a soft, smooth aftertaste. Drink now."
US,90.0,60.0,Livermore Valley,Steven Kent,"This lovingly made wine is packed with boysenberry, black cherry and swirls of vanilla cream around its soft, round texture and structure. Its long finish is laced with plum, whispers of smoke, licorice and a touch of cedar. Another 3?? years in bottle will tame its tannins further and enhance every last nuance."
US,91.0,75.0,Stags Leap District,Shafer,"A substantial and imminently structured wine from a coolish vintage, this blends 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec to impressive effect. Leathery and intense it will benefit with time, its black pepper, red cassis fruit and flowery anise layers commingling in complex ways."
France,87.0,55.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Jaffelin,"This wine is solid, concentrated and tannic, and it has a dark chocolate flavor from having aged in wood. It's likely to develop into a chunky wine over the next few years."
US,86.0,24.0,Anderson Valley,V. Sattui,"Basically a dessert wine because it jumps beyond the off-dry line into overtly sweet. Shows pastry-filling flavors of apricots and pineapples, with rich vanilla and smoky honey overtones."
US,86.0,24.0,Willamette Valley,Cooper Mountain,"Light, tart and slightly mushroomy, this Pinot might pass for a solid Bourgogne from one of the better nÃ©gociants. Organically grown grapes add some lightly earthy notes. All in all, quite pleasant."
US,86.0,50.0,Alexander Valley,Clos du Bois,"Very ripe and extracted, this has flavors of blackberries and cherries that are a bit heavy-handed. There's a lot of oak influence, too, which adds to the heaviness."
France,90.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau Tour de Mirambeau,A light touch of toastiness gives this Despagne family wine extra richness. It offers spice as well as plenty of crisp green and citrus fruits. The two elements balance and will allow this wine to age well. Drink from late 2017 or even early 2018.
US,92.0,35.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Domaine de la Terre Rouge,"Dynamic, intense, and complex, a massive wine that explodes with blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and herb aromas and flavors. Terrific texture, thick and smooth, and totally drinkable tonight."
France,89.0,29.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Vincent,"Named after the current generation's grandmother, this wine comes from family vines. It is crisp with the strong mineral character typical of the vintage. The acidity and citrus fruits are up front and ready to drink now."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,Tezza,"This vintage of Tezza's Corte Majoli Ripasso offers much more intensity on the nose that comes forward as smoky-spice, leather, tobacco and mature berry. The wine is aged in oak and this process had imparted background tones of vanilla and toasted nut."
US,94.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"An acid-lover's Riesling, this is bone dry and loaded with phenolic detail. Fruit flavors run the table on citrus, most especially grapefruit, with plenty of pith and rind. It's lush, tart and deeply penetrating."
US,94.0,50.0,Sonoma County,Donelan,"A Chateauneuf-du-Pape inspired blend of 64% Grenache, 24% MourvÃ¨dre and 12% Syrah, Moriah was not made in 2011 but roars back to life in 2012 light ruby red in color and fully refined in rose petal aromatics. Integrated and subtle, it's focused in bright red fruit and layered white pepper."
US,90.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Emerson,"Thick and lemony, this is a juicy fruit-powered style. It places its power squarely on plush fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, candied orange peel and candied pineapple. It saw no oak and needed none. Drink while it's at its freshest."
Italy,88.0,19.0,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,Jasci & Marchesani,"Violet, plum, black cherry and cooking spice aromas take center stage on this enjoyable red. The juicy tangy palate doles out blackberry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of cinnamon framed in chewy tannins."
Argentina,85.0,12.0,NeuquÃ©n,Familia Schroeder,"A simple but reasonably good white wine. Applesauce and citrus aromas are fruity and clean, while the mango-orange palate is tasty, a little sweet and citric. Pithy on the finish but mellow overall."
US,92.0,32.0,Dry Creek Valley,Dry Creek Vineyard,"Blended with 19% Petite Sirah and 3% Carignane, from vines averaging 50-plus-years of age, this is a bold and brambly wine, laced in elegance. Coffee, leather and a taste of caramel are seasoned in allspice and black pepper, as persistent, sinewy tannins provide weight and heft."
US,83.0,10.0,Lodi,Ironstone,"For the price, you get a fair deal with this dry, clean wine. It has flavors of cherries and oak and spice, and goes down nice and easy."
France,93.0,44.0,Mercurey,Domaine de Suremain,"From perhaps the best known of Mercurey's premier crus, this is a firm solid wine, dense with tannins and concentrated berry fruits. It has a ripe character that is still embedded in the tannins. That means aging and this wine should not be drunk before 2023."
Italy,89.0,120.0,Barolo,Pio Cesare,"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso and exotic spice follow through to the firm palate along with star anise and notes of dried cherry. Bracing, close-grained tannins leave an extremely astringent finish."
US,87.0,125.0,Rutherford,Aiken,"Still young and tight, this cassis-laden wine has a softness, complemented by herb and dusty tannin. As it opens, more ripeness comes to the fore, almost like grenadine, with a braised meat streak to the aroma."
US,92.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Domaine Serene,"This entry-level Pinot from Domaine Serene outshines more than a few Oregon reserves. It's splendidly clear, refined and aromatic, with a tantalizingly smoky note in play. There is a pleasing dusty character to the cherry fruit and the finish is dappled with highlights of cinnamon toast. It's flat-out irresistible."
Italy,94.0,20.0,Bardolino,Le Fraghe,"Showing Bardolino's more serious side, this delicious red opens on aromas of wild berry, pressed blue flower, spice and a balsamic note. With a blend of Corvina and Rondinella, the elegant, well-structured palate delivers morello cherry, black pepper and clove. Refined tannins provide the polished framework. Drink through 2019."
France,89.0,115.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Louis Latour,"Concentrated, with dark tannins to go with the ripe fruit. There is a tough edge to the wine, although it is more accessible than some Nuits-Saint-Georges at this stage."
US,91.0,43.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"Ample toast, cinnamon and cedar gild this intensely ripe concentrated Cabernet Franc. It's a lusciously textured wine, full of fleshy blackberry and plum flavors. Velvety tannins, brisk red-currant acidity and meandering traces of smoked meat and game contribute finesse and depth. It's ready to drink now but should improve further through 2023."
Italy,94.0,350.0,Toscana,Tua Rita,"One of Italy's truly great 100% Merlots, this wine opens with aromas of plum, black currants and exotic spices. The opulent, smooth palate delivers blackberry, white pepper and a note of creamy milk chocolate alongside firm, velvety tannins. Soft and round, it's delicious now, but it will also develop for a decade or more. Drink 2016??026."
France,92.0,87.0,Champagne,Henriet-Bazin,Marie-AmÃ©lie is the daughter of the Henriets and her cuvÃ©e is a fine blend of ripe fruits from the difficult 2010 vintage. It has a crisp element as well as fresh acidity and delicious apple juice and ripe pear flavors. A crisper element gives a balanced wine that has soft acidity at the end.
France,87.0,24.0,Banyuls,Les Clos de Paulilles,"Notes of dried dark berry, leathery spice, sweet tobacco and chocolate-covered cherry fill the nose of this wine. The satiny texture pairs well with the dusty tannins, and additional flavors of prune, sweet smoke and fresh caramel linger through the medium-length finish."
France,90.0,20.0,Buzet,Vignerons de Buzet,"The wine comes from a 196-acre property on the first slopes above the Garonne river. Made from the classic Bordeaux blend, it has been aged in wood which gives the intense perfumed, toasty character. The wine is dense, tannic with layers of black fruits. It needs to age more, so drink from 2016."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more."
US,87.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Pursuit,"Dry and tannic, with black cherry, blackberry, leather, cedar and peppery spice flavors. A tough, gritty wine that needs serious decanting."
US,81.0,7.0,Missouri,Les Bourgeois,"Scents of red licorice and candied ruby grapefruit and red berry portend the sweetness of this wine. The palate feels slack, and it comes with noticeable residual sugar. Delicate tannins lend the finish light traction."
France,92.0,23.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Roubine,"Bright and fruity, this crisp and fresh wine is full of lively red currants and berries cut with acidity and a tangy, orange peel texture. This is a great summer rosÃ©."
US,92.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Ballentine,"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors."
US,83.0,34.0,Carneros,Tin Barn,"This is a simple Pinot Noir that has raspberry and cherry jam flavors. While it has a delicate mouthfeel, it tastes candied and sweet."
US,93.0,60.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"From a low-yielding vineyard full of galets, or stones, comes an excellent and dark wine, with aromas of cherry pie in a mint-speckled crust along with graphite and blueberry. The palate is a swirl of cola, rooibos tea and blackberry juice, with sharper eucalyptus notes coming through on the finish."
France,89.0,45.0,Champagne,Chassenay d'Arce,"This wine is all fruit that has some age to give it richness, with a high dosage that adds soft texture. The result is a balanced, smooth and very drinkable wine. Floral aromas and a spicy character bring out the final acidity. The bottling is ready to drink."
US,91.0,18.0,Santa Barbara County,Brander,"This unique blend of 37% Sauvignon Blanc, 38% Pinot Gris and 25% Riesling plays each grape to a distinct advantage. Its fresh aromas recall yellow blossoms, jasmine and stone, while the palate bursts with rounded stone fruit and tangy citrus peel flavors, all driven by bright acidity."
US,82.0,13.0,Finger Lakes,Prejean,"A pretty, floral nose adds a surprising dimension to this wine, but on the palate, the flavors fall somewhat flat. A good balance of oak and fruit prevails, but the nose suggests more."
US,88.0,34.0,Wahluke Slope,Bunnell,"An oak-driven blend of Syrah, Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre, Cinsault, and Petite Sirah with notes of vanilla and woodspice sitting atop concentrated dark cherries, stewed raspberries, and white pepper leading to a vanilla filled finish."
France,88.0,18.0,Alsace,Mittnacht FrÃ¨res,"Classic, soft, easy and broad Pinot Blanc. There is an attractive buttery character to go with the peach and lime flavors. The wine is ripe, with pure fruit and a final tang of acidity."
France,94.0,100.0,Champagne,ThiÃ©not,"White flowers and almonds give fragrance to this Chardonnay-dominant Champagne. It is a concentrated wine, full of ripe white fruits, with a tight core of acidity. Named after the producer's owner, it is a flagship wine, intense and just ready to drink."
US,90.0,60.0,Edna Valley,No Limit,"This wine shows roasted beef with blackberry crust, fresh-cracked black pepper and tarry asphalt on the nose. The asphalt and charred meat play strongly on the heavy-duty palate that also offers blackberry balsamic reduction. It's brawny and burly, perhaps too much so for the everyday drinker."
US,86.0,47.0,Willamette Valley,VinStrata,"Already entering its maturity, this offers flavors of dried cherries, cherry tobacco and rather tough, chewy tannins. It seems to have a hole in the midpalate, and may be moving quickly past its prime. Drink up."
France,89.0,32.0,Lalande de Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau la Croix Romane,"In this Merlot-dominated wine, powerful wood flavors still show strongly against the fresh, juicy black-currant and berry fruits. As this combination ages, it will produce a ripe, full and always fruity wine with strong final acidity. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now."
Italy,94.0,90.0,Barolo,Brovia,"This classically styled Barolo has hallmark Nebbiolo scents of rose, violet, spice, leather and forest floor. The creamy palate delivers wild cherry flavors, layered with spice, mint, licorice and eucalyptus notes. It's well balanced, fresh and structured. While it's already enjoyable, drink it after 2018 for more complexity."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Maison Bouey,"Touched by spice from wood aging, this is a balanced wine. Its toastiness supports the ripe peach and apricot fruits, lifted by acidity. It will be a good wine; drink from 2018."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Rosso Conero,Fattoria Le Terrazze,"Floral aromas of blue flower and bright berry take center stage in this pretty blend of 85% Montepulciano and 15% Syrah. The palate delivers juicy raspberry and cherry flavors, alongside soft, supple tannins. This is round and extremely accessible now so enjoy soon."
US,84.0,28.0,Rutherford,Conspire,"While there's no oak here, there's a heft and weight to the mouthfeel of this wine. The flavors veer toward orange and apricot jam."
US,84.0,25.0,Sonoma Valley,Wellington,"High alcohol makes this Grenache seem hot and sweet in glycerine. It tastes candied, with cherry pie and red licorice flavors."
US,91.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Seven Hills,"Smooth and palate-coating, it's 100% varietal, with just the right balance between blackberry and black cherry fruit, and barrel-induced flavors of toffee, toasted macadamia nuts, and cafÃ© crÃ¨me."
US,87.0,40.0,Sierra Foothills,Terre Rouge,"Savory and herbal, this Roussanne is given more time on lees and made to be rich and complex. It accomplishes those goals, providing medium body and high acidity, a texture that is dry, and wild in honey and dried apricot. Pair with lobster."
US,91.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"The cool vintage has kept this wine tart in acidity; and there may even be a touch of botrytis, to judge from the golden apricot note that rides over the pears, limes and buttery cream. Bone dry and minerally, it's an elegant, Chablis-style wine for drinking now."
US,86.0,18.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Stonehouse,"A little sugary-sweet, but the acidity is so crisp and clean, it balances things out. The pineapple, papaya, peach jam, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors are really delicious."
US,87.0,27.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pech Merle,"This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick. It erupts in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, cola, anise and white pepper that should pair well with equally spicy fare, preferably fatty meats and cheeses."
Argentina,88.0,20.0,Mendoza,Rubus,"Blueberry, plum and cardamom aromas include a whiff of wood smoke. A balanced palate has energy along with brambly berry and chocolate flavors. A chewy, solid finish is good but less lively than the palate."
US,89.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Clos du Val,"This Reserve requires the faith of a true believer in its future. It's awkward now, a tannic, very new-oaky wine with jammy black currant flavors, and seems all over the place. We know from long experience that CDV Cabs age terrifically, and this one might. Best after 2012, and could improve a great   deal."
Italy,87.0,24.0,Lazio,Casale del Giglio,"Casale del Giglio, from the Lazio region in central Italy, exports what may well be Italy's only 100% expression of Petit Manseng. The wine is fragrant and ripe with pretty tones of peach blossom, jasmine and honeysuckle."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Etna,Biondi,"Scents of Spanish broom, pineapple, orchard fruit and a saline note meld together in the glass. The focused palate offers mature apple, peach, botanical herb and mineral alongside firm acidity."
Italy,94.0,43.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Abbadia Ardenga,"An alluring fragrance of rose, aromatic herb, dark berry and a whiff of new leather take shape in the glass. The firm palate delivers ripe, dark berry, grilled sage, mint and sweet pipe tobacco alongside austere tannins that need time to come around. It's well balanced, with a licorice finish. Drink after 2018."
US,91.0,52.0,Sonoma Coast,Williams Selyem,"This shows the lovely balance of both the winery and the appellation, with a silky, lightly tannic mouthfeel brightened by plenty of acidity. The flavors are delicate and complex, suggesting wild raspberries, thyme, cranberries and toast. No reason to age this puppy, so drink now??016."
France,90.0,13.0,Madiran,Domaine du MouliÃ©,"A fine blend with 60% Tannat that has been softened and filled out by Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon. It still does have a firm tannic core although this is surrounded by ripe black fruits and acidity. It has all its bright fruit and so could age further, although it is now ready to drink."
US,88.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Castello di Amorosa,"This is a supremely earthy and highly tannic wine, leathery and smoky in oak and texture. Grown in the foothills of Diamond Mountain, as well as pockets of Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder, the variety is unusual for the Napa Valley. This one is worthwhile, showing subtle cassis, cranberry and vanilla."
France,93.0,75.0,Champagne,Philipponnat,"Only disgorged in 2007, this fine vintage wine has preserved all its freshness. There are white fruits, pear juice, a crisp texture. They combine well to create a wine with considerable minerality, flinty, but full in the mouth. Age over the next 4?? years."
US,88.0,25.0,Willamette Valley,Lundeen,"Chunky, chewy and full-bodied, this fills the glass with flavors of tart red berries, tea leaves, wintergreen and a whiff of smoke. It's a gulp-able, interesting, and relatively affordable example of the outstanding 2012 vintage in Oregon."
Italy,89.0,37.0,Barbaresco,Luca Bosio,"This bright, elegant wine opens with wild berry, violet, cake spice and aromatic herb notes. The palate delivers red cherry, cranberry, white pepper and licorice flavors framed by taut, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity."
Italy,92.0,75.0,Barbaresco,Cascina Luisin,"Alluring Nebbiolo aromas of dark berry, purple flower, baking spice, truffle and herb slowly unfold in this wine. The savory, succulent palate doles out Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and licorice flavors against a backdrop of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity."
Argentina,87.0,10.0,Mendoza,Finca El Origen,"Clean, fresh, stony aromas are basic but good. A round palate benefits from citric kick, while this tastes of mixed tropical fruits backed by skins-based bitterness."
US,95.0,75.0,Rutherford,Inglenook,"This bottling reflects the past several years' fine-tuning the winery's vision in the vineyard and in the cellar. Including small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's a rounded, concentrated wine that expresses the vintage with ripe, grippy tannins that beg for further resolution. Blackberry, clove and leather flavors rise to the fore. Cellar through 2035."
US,82.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Babcock,"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful."
US,86.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Maisonry,"A nice, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, a little sweet and simple, but satisfying nonetheless for its array of ripe pineapple, citrus, lime, green apple and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Morellino di Scansano,Santa Lucia,"Aromas suggest leafy underbrush, woodland berry and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The lean palate offers raw red cherry and the barest hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins."
France,86.0,14.0,Pays d'Oc,Lorgeril,"There's a slight mealy presence to this wine, with warm aromas of muddled plum and cherry. Hints of black tea and plum skin lend some texture and astringency to the palate, coupled with soft tannins and an overall light, approachable character. Drink now."
US,90.0,32.0,Willamette Valley,Apolloni,"A fine value in Oregon Pinot Noir, the estate bottling from Apolloni brings typical varietal flavors of sassafras, cherry cola and fresh herb. The fruit is perfectly ripe, yet retains the peppery, herbal, leafy character of northern Willamette Valley sites. Barrel aging adds length, texture and a finishing splash of butterfat."
France,89.0,60.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau Rauzan-Gassies,"The second wine of classed growth Rauzan-Gassies in Margaux is ripe, soft with touches of licorice, wood aging and spice. It has attractive, forward red-berry flavors and the tannins of the 65% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. It is ready to drink."
US,89.0,22.0,Santa Maria Valley,Zaca Mesa,"Baked lemon, jasmine and honeyed Pink Lady apples open the nose of this bottling, a special anniversary project for the usually RhÃ´ne-only winery. Lighter flavors of lemon zest and crisp apple flesh sit atop a chalky grip, making for a wine that would work well with a variety of lighter foods."
US,89.0,28.0,Finger Lakes,Inspire Moore,"Delicate whiffs of black cherry and berry intensify on the palate of this vibrant, delicately concentrated Pinot Noir. It's fresh and fruity yet elegantly structured offering fine lingering tannins and bright cranberry acidity. Extensive aging in new French oak lends a lavish spicy character that reverberates through the finish."
US,86.0,14.0,Paso Robles,Clayhouse,"This is a sweeter and fruity take on the grape, beginning with a nose of fresh and vibrant boysenberry fruit and wet-asphalt minerality. The palate is tasty in a hedonistic way, but very primary, with flavors of fruit punch."
Spain,87.0,15.0,PenedÃ¨s,Albet I Noya,"Peach and yeast aromas are mostly fresh. This Xarello has a citrus-like palate with the suggestion of spritz. Melon, green banana and papaya flavors finish with mild pithy bitterness but nothing off-putting."
US,89.0,14.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Roza Ridge,"This Syrah bears a gamy accent that overlays the flavors of juicy berries, herbs and spices. A peppery note highlights the clean, crisp finish."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Lyeth,"Dry, thin and simple, with a green, minty streak and lots of acidity. Still, with some decent blackberry fruit, it's not a bad wine for the price."
US,90.0,28.0,Paso Robles,Calcareous,"Petite Verdot is a hard variety to succeed on its own, but Calcareous has produced a fine, dry wine made from that Bordeaux variety. It's full-bodied and complex, with flavors of currants, mushu plum sauce, violets, dark chocolate and anise. Such are the tannins that the wine should develop through 2010."
US,88.0,15.0,California,Malibu Rocky Oaks,"Crisp, clean aromas of Asian pear, Pink Lady apple, dried pineapple and a touch of dried melon show on the nose of this wine from a group of Malibu vintners. The palate shows ripe apple and brown-pear flavors, with a bubblegum twist and lime-juice acidity."
Italy,90.0,33.0,Taurasi,Le Masciare,"The nose is a bit shy but eventually reveals subdued aromas suggesting leather, underbrush, chopped herb and dark-skinned fruit. The robust, enveloping palate doles out fleshy blackberry, mature morello cherry, licorice and vanilla framed in solid tannins. Drink 2019??026."
Australia,89.0,15.0,Rutherglen,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,"Medium amber in color, this Muscat boasts scents of berries, pineapple and raisin to go with flavors of honey and spice. It's a lush, sweet style, with less complexity than some, but great texture and length."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Pietrafitta,"This is a lean white wine with pretty aromas of stone fruit and some banana and mango. There's a bit more flesh and pulp here, which makes the wine suitable for freshwater fish or pasta salad."
US,86.0,24.0,Napa Valley,Apriori,"Fresh-cut grass and gooseberry dominate on the nose of this wine, a style that's not for everyone. From there, bristling sparks of lemon and lime dominate, giving the wine a refreshing edge. Unoaked, the finish is a tad severe in its austerity."
US,92.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,Graton Ridge,"Dryness, tannins and acidity mark this elegantly structured Pinot Noir. It's an earthy wine, with mushroom and herb notes to the cherries and cola. Maintains a sense of restraint, while tantalizing with complexity. Drink now??015."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Lugana Superiore,Ottella,"Yellow peach, pear, mineral, Alpine herbs and almond jump out of the glass. The elegant but structured palate delivers a great depth of flavors alongside crisp acidity. It's already delicious but will also develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink now through 2016."
US,94.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,La Follette,"This wine is both incredibly pretty and wild, a tenacious quality of feral forest and ocean at its core. Honeysuckle and rose provide the beauty first, followed by a depth of gorgeous cherry, strawberry and rhubarb, the fruit alive and fresh atop a gravelly texture of complexity."
US,86.0,30.0,Washington,Almquist,Aromas of saddle leather and sour cherry are followed by lightly styled tart cherry flavors and gritty tannins.
US,90.0,36.0,Sonoma Valley,Westwood,"Estate-grown Roussanne (63%), Viognier (32%) and Chardonnay (5%) are blended together in a medium-bodied coming-together of floral, light aromatics and supportive acidity. Fruity highlights run the gamut of apricot, peach and lime, with a tiny touch of sweetness on the finish."
Italy,89.0,19.0,Chianti Classico,Podere Capaccia,"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, menthol, blue flowers and spice lead the nose. The fresh palate offers dried black cherry, plum, aromatic herb and clove. It's balanced, with firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity."
US,95.0,75.0,Sonoma Mountain,Paul Hobbs,"This exquisitely crafted model of balance offers lemon-bar meringue and baked pear on the nose before revealing a tightrope of minerality and lush concentration on the palate, weighted perfectly against each other. Fleshy and delicious, the wine has so much fine fruit to offer now it'd be shame to wait, yet it will clearly hold onto its beauty with age."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Valpolicella Classico,Terre di Leone,"?Il Re Pazzo,??which is Italian for ?the crazy king,??delivers a cheerful berry note, with enough spice, tobacco and leather tones to give the wine heft and staying power. The sharp note of acidity would make this pair well with cheesy pasta."
France,88.0,18.0,La Clape,ChÃ¢teau d'AnglÃ¨s,"Notes of orchard apple, peach skin, yellow melon, orange blossom and a touch of beeswax unfold on the bouquet of this nuanced rosÃ©. It's medium in weight, with a softness on the midpalate that's lifted on the close by ample acidity."
Australia,88.0,25.0,Coonawarra,Yalumba,"There's a bright, almost Ribena-like quality to the fruit in this wine, with underlying hints of wood and mint. It's full bodied, but the tannins are modest and softly rounded, making it deceptively easy to down. Drink now??018."
Spain,89.0,31.0,RÃ­as Baixas,La CaÃ±a,"A yellowish color announces this oaked AlbariÃ±o. Aromas of sunflower seeds and stone fruits are more mellow than loud. Creamy and full bodied, this benefits from bold malic acidity. Flavors of summer corn, dried apple and wood resin finish salty. Drink now with fish, crab or lobster."
US,85.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Eaglewood,"Brown sugar and brown apple betty figure into this wine's aroma and flavor profile, making for a slightly overdone quality of ripeness. Slightly tropical as it moves along, the finish is robust in size and body."
US,88.0,32.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Demetria,"Lots of delicious blackberry, cherry, cola, roasted meat and sandalwood flavors in this Syrah. While it has a certain fanciness, it's kind of simple, soft in structure and without a future. Drink it now, especially with lamb dishes, or try a vegetarian lasagna."
France,83.0,22.0,Saint-Amour,Georges Duboeuf,"The cru wine is tight, missing out on what should be its fruitiness. It has some tough dry tannins that are not showing signs of softening."
US,84.0,20.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Los Portales,"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge."
Italy,86.0,16.0,Terre Siciliane,Duca di Salaparuta,"This blend of 60% Nero d'Avola and 40% Merlot has a pretty fragrance of blue flower, black berry and baking spice. The simple palate is less expressive, offering fleeting wild cherry flavors."
US,92.0,45.0,Santa Maria Valley,Chanin,"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011."
US,87.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Raymond,"A small addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot don't rein in any of this wine's significant power, highlighted in plummy licorice and inviting aromas of chocolate that mellow on the palate, revealing a thick and rich explosion of ripeness with a concentrated finish."
France,92.0,33.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Pontac Monplaisir,"Named after the Pontac family which in the 18th century owned large swathes of Bordeaux and its vineyards, this estate is based around a former hunting lodge. The wine is ripe and full, finely structured and with tight still-young acidity. Drink from 2022."
US,88.0,25.0,Texas,Brennan,"A bit of skin contact gives this Viognier some extra character and texture. Quite aromatic on the nose, peach and pineapple juice aromas are shot through with pink peppercorns and grapefruit spray. The rich palate shows good acidic verve, however it feels slightly hot. Notes of jasmine show up on the midpalate leading to a slight astringent bitterness. In the end, fruit tones prevail and linger on a moderate finish."
US,90.0,150.0,Napa Valley,Pine Ridge,"The winery blends 84% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec for this high-end red. Burly in tobacco and cedar, it also offers a floral, high-toned spirit built around juicy cranberry on the palate. With well-integrated tannins and oak, it finishes in a note of bittersweet chocolate."
Spain,87.0,25.0,Rioja,DinastÃ­a Vivanco,"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose. The palate shows average density and depth, with lighter flavors of strawberry, raspberry, herbs, tobacco and vanilla. Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast."
US,90.0,15.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now."
Italy,94.0,60.0,Barolo,Brezza,"Scents of rose, violet, leather, berry and spice unfold from the glass. The linear palate displays sour cherry, juicy raspberry, mint, thyme, balsam and baking spices alongside invigorating energy and supple tannins. Drink 2018??030. Acid Inc Selections, Stefano Miretti Imports."
US,88.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,WesMar,"A soft, ripe style of Pinot Noir showing cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Drink this fruity young wine now."
US,86.0,16.0,Dry Creek Valley,Pedroncelli,"Considering this is Petite Sirah, this is surprisingly soft and gentle?almost like a Pinot Noir. The texture is silky, with flavors of cherries, currants, Canadian bacon and black pepper. Drink now."
Italy,89.0,18.0,Alto Adige,Cantina Terlano,"In northeast Italy (in this case Alto Adige) they don't use the ?Blanc??qualifier, but this is definitely SB. Lemon and mineral qualities are strong on the nose and in the mouth, while driving acids create a mouth-watering feel. While citrus rind and a touch of toast offer nice secondary qualities, the main flavors are apple and something akin to tangerine. A distant almond marzipan note comes on as a lasting final impression."
France,86.0,16.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Trenel Fils,"Crisp and textured, this is a ripe wine with a core of tight structure. Fruity with its lemon and apple flavors, it has a lightly herbal edge that adds a green, fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
US,92.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Spring Valley Vineyard,"This introduces itself with sweet scents of plum and cherry, the sort found in young vines. It moves into a thick, well-structured midpalate, with big splashes of coffee, earth and roasted nut."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Marchesi di Barolo,"A charming package, with raspberries and fresh plums as an opening act followed by leather and mushrooms on the palate and just a hint of tannin. The finish falls a bit short but offers up an intriguing watermelon note. Drink up."
France,89.0,25.0,Francs CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Cru Godard,"Touches of vanilla and caramel give this wine an extra dimension of richness. It is full while remaining crisp and herbaceous, with a lively, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2016. The Richard family's two-acre Sauvignon Blanc vineyard is certified organic."
US,86.0,9.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Barnard Griffin,"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and SÃ©millon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley. It shows plenty of Sauvignon's herbal character while also displaying the ripeness of the vintage, with lightly spritzy tropical fruit and fig flavors that possess a fleshy feel."
US,88.0,57.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,SÃ©amus Wines,"Dried black cherry, shaved chocolate and dried herb aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a producer based in Marietta, Georgia. Fat flavors of cocoa and black cherry mousse make for a compelling sip."
Spain,80.0,15.0,Rueda,Aromal,"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution."
US,86.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,McGregor,"Smoky and a bit stark with whiffs of struck flint and stone. This off-dry Riesling is piercing on the palate with nervy lime-juice and lime-skin flavors. The finish is medium long, ending on a softly floral, crushed-stone note."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Tenuta di Riseccoli,"With its violet, berry, spice and leather sensations, this savory blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot displays the quintessential perfume of a youthful Chianti Classico. The juicy wild cherry and ripe raspberry flavors are accented by notes of cracked black pepper and hints of grilled herbs that add depth. Refined and delicious. Drink 2014??018. Trilussa Wine, J.W. Sieg Wines."
Italy,88.0,15.0,Collio,Borgo Conventi,"Crisp, green, grassy wine with fresh acidity and herbeceous character. It is very New World with its tropical flavors and open, forward fruit."
Spain,88.0,27.0,Priorat,Scala Dei,"Cherry and plum aromas come with overt notes of sucking candy and schist. In the mouth, this is grabby, raw and tannic, with mild astringency. Cherry, plum and boysenberry flavors run sweet and candied, while the finish is baked, with loamy weight. Drink through 2019."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Charles Krug,"Thick and chocolatey, this brawny wine is full bodied and richly concentrated. It is a mighty force of blackberry, blueberry and toasted oak."
US,87.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Windsor Sonoma,"Rich and soft and silky, a nice Pinot for drinking now. Flatters for its wealth of raspberries, cherries, persimmons, cola, spices and sandalwood."
France,91.0,20.0,Morgon,Georges Duboeuf,"Rich and full in the mouth, this still-young wine also has a good structure. It is dark and dense, smoky over the red-berry fruits. Concentrated fruit and tannins give a solid base for the wine's ripe, aromatic character. Drink from 2017."
US,89.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Argyle,"Argyle sets the standard for Northwest sparkling wine, and this wine beguiles from the beginning. The massive bead, citrus-scented bouquet and perfect fruit is balanced elegantly by palate-clearing acids and just a hint of toast. The wine is a 100% barrel-fermented blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay."
US,88.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Oso Libre,"Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper. The meaty wine really gets your attention once sipped, with boysenberry, cracked peppercorn, some iron and a lingering licorice flavors."
US,88.0,32.0,Wahluke Slope,Bergevin Lane,"In sharp contrast to the heavily oaked companion Syrahs from Bergevin Lane, the Oui Deux puts the fruit up front. Spicy and sharp-toned, it was co-fermented with 5% Viognier, and for all practical terms is a Stonetree Vineyard bottling. It should continue to improve nicely with a couple more years of bottle age."
US,92.0,75.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Corliss Estates,"Brooding aromas of barrel spices, red and black fruit, freshly brewed coffee and pencil lead are followed by an intense full palate. It displays a lot of layers to explore."
Spain,84.0,54.0,Navarra,Bodegas JuliÃ¡n Chivite,"Nutty, oaky aromas along with a gold-brown maderized color indicate a wine past its prime. In the mouth, there's not much fruit left but there is a whole lot of weight and resiny oak. Lead flavors of almond and walnut oil suggest Sherry more than Chardonnay."
US,87.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Arger-Martucci,"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now??012."
Canada,86.0,45.0,Niagara-On-The-Lake,Pillitteri,"This special-edition wine carries a striking logo relating to a particular chair that has something to do with the owners. Apart from that, it's pretty standard stuff?black cherry, plum and cocoa flavors with a definite green edge. It finishes tannic and chewy with a bit of alcoholic heat."
France,89.0,37.0,Sauternes,ChÃ¢teau Gravas,"A rich wine from a fine Sauternes year. It has honey, sweet orange marmalade and just enough freshness. At the same time, there is enough botrytis to give a good dry edge. With its weight and bit of spice, it could age."
US,92.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Ottimino Vineyards,"When Russian River Zinfandel succeeds, and this one does, it marries the variety's wild, feral personality to the valley's perfect terroir to produce distinctive wines. Ottimino's 2005 Von Weidlich is very tannic, but classic in presentation, showing blackberry, currant and intense black pepper aromas and flavors. Might tempt you to cellar it, but it's best over the next year for sheer exuberance."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Tussock Jumper,"Quiet up front, with dull, candied aromas of black cherry and plum. This feels bullish and grabby, with clipped, crisp flavors of red plum and cherry pie filling. Fresh, but it comes up short on flavor on the finish."
US,90.0,25.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Claiborne & Churchill,"Salted lemons, seared nectarine, chamomile, yellow apple and a touch of sourdough show on this bottling, which deftly balances crispness with richness. Slightly browner flavors pop on the palate, with buttered peaches, lemon oil and Marcona almonds."
Australia,92.0,65.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"This Grenache-based blend derives considerable structure from its Shiraz (38%) and MourvÃ¨dre (7%) components, giving it more firmness, length and ageability than might be expected. Dark chocolate and berry aromas and flavors pick up hints of dried tobacco and other herbs, ending on a crisp note. Give it two or three years, then drink it over the next 10??2."
US,87.0,8.0,Washington,Columbia Crest,"A mongrel blend of Syrah, Sangiovese, Grenache and Cabernet Franc, this fruity red has a sweet core of blueberry jam, round and forward and quite appealing. It's dusted with baking spices and fades gently into a soft finish. Hard to imagine a more agreeable bottle of Washington red at this price."
Australia,92.0,20.0,Clare Valley,Kilikanoon,"Despite a nose and palate that delivers plenty of mixed citrus fruit, this comes across as very dry. It's lemony and crisp on the long, austere finish. Drink now with oysters, or cellar for 5??0 years."
Italy,89.0,23.0,Valle d'Aosta,Cave du Vin Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle,"Honeysuckle, chamomile, pear and passion fruit aromas meld together in the glass. The palate offers pear, apricot, nectarine peel and a touch of tropical fruit alongside brisk acidity. It closes on an almond note."
France,93.0,36.0,Coteaux du Layon Beaulieu,ChÃ¢teau Pierre-Bise,"Already with a deep golden color, this single vineyard wine is richly honeyed and dense. It has a viscous texture, ripe with Seville orange marmalade and apricot fruits that are cut by the acidity that gives this wine its lift and its ageability. The wine is delicious now, but don't be too impatient: it will get better and better over many years. So drink from 2020."
US,90.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Coelho,"Ripe strawberry compote typifies this appealing wine. The nicely ripened fruit is set in a mineral-driven, high acid frame, and shows both texture and length as it develops in the mouth. It's especially noteworthy given the moderate alcohol."
France,92.0,95.0,Champagne,Dom Caudron,"A 50-50 blend of Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay from the Marne Valley gives this wood-aged wine richness, with good spice and flavor concentration. Dry and crisp, it benefits from the fine vintage to highlight ripe grapes with acidity and citrus flavors. The wine is ready to drink."
US,92.0,26.0,Central Coast,Calera,"Savory, earthy aromas of mushrooms, black pepper, iron and cranberry arise from this blend of nine vineyards, many of which are usually featured in single-vineyard selections. Umami rules the palate, and it's quite full for a lighter-colored wine, with brown spice, light red fruit flavors and expertly balanced acidity."
US,87.0,45.0,Knights Valley,Murphy-Goode,"Weighted in tannins and oak, this wine is also perfumed in ripe berry and chocolate, along with dried herb. Bittersweet tobacco marks the finish, complemented in vanilla."
Argentina,92.0,64.0,Uco Valley,Salentein,"Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best. It's harmonious and inviting, with cola, mineral, floral notes and honest black fruit aromas and flavors. The feel is secure and tight but also well balanced, with a touch of molasses but mostly just deep, driving black fruit. Muscular, intense and long on the finish. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,23.0,Collio,Marco Felluga,"Molamatta is a blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano and Ribolla Gialla that opens with a pretty golden color and rich aromas of creamy peach and vanilla mousse with pretty highlights of citrus and light spice. This feels rich and long on the palate."
US,91.0,45.0,McMinnville,Hyland,"This rich and creamy wine definitely pulls out the new barrel flavors, with buttery nut, salted caramel and toast notes highlighting its ripe peach and apple fruit. From vines planted in 1989, it's styled for drinking right now."
Spain,82.0,13.0,Somontano,GlÃ¡rima,"This blend is so oaky and sticky on the nose that it smells like a Hershey's Kiss. The palate is out of balance, with chunky weight and unintegrated acidity. Like the nose, this tastes like a drugstore chocolate bar, while the finish is hot."
Spain,86.0,16.0,Vi de la Terra Mallorca,?nima Negra,"This white blend from Mallorca is melony up front and, like an island wine is prone to show, saline is all over the nose. In the mouth, this is melony but not too soft, with flavors of papaya, banana and honeydew. A smooth, creamy finish says drink this soon."
US,94.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,"So upfront in spectacularly ripe raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, it's hard to keep from draining the bottle now. This shows the classic tannins of Stags Leap, soft and sweet but potent. Drink it now and enjoy for sheer opulence, but you might be missing out on something really special around 2016."
US,85.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The blend includes 18% Syrah, which helps to emphasize the spice and sweet fruit flavors. But in the back, this is a stiff and fairly tannic wine, with a disconnect between the strawberry fruit and the slightly stemmy, herbal finish."
Spain,86.0,17.0,Rioja,Bodegas Muriel,"Opens with a warm, baked nose of raisin, roasted plum and tobacco. The palate is scouring and crisp due to sharp acids, and thus the flavors follow suit in that they're lean and tart and focus on pie cherry and red plum. Lean, zesty and lively Rioja to drink now."
France,85.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Georges Duboeuf,"From vines with an average age of 40 years old, this wine is the Duboeuf classic. It is soft, easy and fruity with its red fruits and gentle tannins. There is a dry edge to the wine, giving a touch of concentration. Drink this crisp wine now."
US,87.0,14.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Mercer Canyons,"The barrel notes of vanilla and wood spice are out front on this blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 1% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot. It's dry in feel, pulling up a bit short."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Bortolotti,"This Prosecco Superiore is characterized by an immediate whiff of tree-fresh lemon and shows a stronger citrus quality than most sparklers in its category. The close is steely, bright and dry."
Spain,82.0,19.0,Montsant,GarbÃ³,"Oxidized and flat on the nose, this has a palate with mealy, bland strawberry flavors. Nothing changes on a fading, less-than-fresh finish."
France,86.0,39.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Domaine du Grand Tinel,"Decant this wine to help lessen the burnt match aroma that mars the nose initially. Once past that annoyance, this is a broad, very drinkable wine that blends pineapple notes with touches of honey, spice and alcoholic warmth. Drink now."
US,83.0,25.0,North Fork of Long Island,Palmer,"Intense perfume and floral notes overcome ripe apple aromas. It's dry on the palate with flavors of savory apple and green herbs, but feels a bit flat and heavy in mouthfeel."
France,85.0,13.0,Vin de Pays de la MÃ©diterranÃ©e,Jean-Luc Colombo,"This blend of two-thirds Syrah and one-third MourvÃ¨dre is fresh and aromatic, showing some peppery-gingery spice to go with watermelon and strawberry notes. It's medium in body, with an abbreviated finish."
France,89.0,22.0,Alsace,Domaine Mersiol,"The nose gives almost nothing away. The palate, however, is full of mild, tender and rounded pear fruit. This is very fluid, almost a little dilute, but very easy, very light and full of that mild tender pear. The finish is dry."
France,86.0,22.0,Coteaux du Languedoc,Le Mas de Bertrand,"A Syrah-dominant blend with 20% Grenache and 20% Cinsault, this wine exhibits some greenness to the skin-driven red fruit flavors. Herbal notes of rosemary and thyme sprigs add depth to the nose and mouth, while a touch of mocha graces the clean finish."
US,90.0,16.0,Napa Valley,Girard,"This wine packs a punch of flavor for the price, and is made in large enough quantities to find easily. Vibrant in lemon, lime and mandarin orange, it's smooth, refreshing and delicious."
Australia,86.0,60.0,Heathcote,Two Hands,"This ambitious offering from Two Hands is a bit of dissappointment. The bold black cherry fruit seems slightly cooked or raisiny, and there's a grassy, herbal element as well. But it's also nicely concentrated and weighty, with a mouthwatering finish that redeems it."
US,88.0,28.0,Red Hills Lake County,Sol Rouge,"Mostly rich and broad in mouthfeel, this offers light, savory aromas of dried herb and sunbaked earth plus solid plum and red berry flavors. It features a full body, firm texture and flavor complexity."
US,91.0,45.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"The best of the 2009 lineup from Willamette Valley Vineyards, this Eola-Amity Hills single-vineyard offering has the most complexity, in both nose and mouthfeel. Balanced fruits fill the palate, with spicy hints of earth, leaf and a wash of barrel-induced mocha."
France,88.0,18.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau du Cros,"Structured and firm, with dense, dry tannins, this wine also has plenty of fruit. Black cherry flavors envelop its dry core, feeling rich and ready to drink from 2021."
US,83.0,11.0,Monterey County,Cooper Station,"This is your typical inexpensive California Chardonnay. It's overtly fruity with orange, pineapple, vanilla bean and buttered toast flavors."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Calatayud,MarquÃ©s de MontaÃ±ana,"Rubbery, herbal red-berry aromas introduce a fresh but grating palate with high acidity. This tastes a touch oaky and herbal, with generic red-fruit flavors. A crisp, slightly sharp finish is as you'd expect."
Spain,86.0,12.0,La Mancha,Finca Antigua,"Kicks off with minty coconut aromas and prune, then a hint of creamy green. The palate shows proper acidity and tannin balance, so the framing for the wine's raspberry flavors is good. Grabby but fresh on the finish, with just enough grapey richness."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Colli di Faenza,Rontana,"This Sangiovese from central Italy offers abundant freshness and pretty aromas of wild berry, almond, cola and dried ginger. There's a touch of dried herb and licorice that gives the wine a bright, buoyant finish."
Italy,90.0,50.0,Maremma Toscana,Mazzei,"Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, this boasts aromas of black currant, mature plum, black pepper and clove. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and Mediterranean brush accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins."
US,89.0,18.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"A rich, savory Pinot Gris that's just a little sweet, and has a slight fizziness that makes it lively. Rich in citrus, tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, brightened with brilliant acidity, it shows a buttery smokiness from neutral oak. Drink this refreshing wine now."
US,89.0,12.0,Finger Lakes,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards,"Intensely tropical on the nose and palate, this off-dry Riesling shines with notes of juicy melon, papaya and peach candy, with a hint of white, waxy flower for extra flair. Brisk acidity keeps all that fruity sweetness in check, leading to a sleek, steely finish."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Toscana,Il Poggione,"Here's a plump, juicy rosÃ© from Tuscany with a pretty palette of aromas that goes from wild berries to pink flower. There's a touch of ash or white mineral at the back and the wine tastes generous and full in the mouth. It has intensity, personality and staying power."
France,90.0,32.0,VirÃ©-ClessÃ©,Domaine Michel,"Big and ripe, this rich wine offers a good combination of spice and tropical fruits. It is bold, smooth and creamy. Deliciously ripe, it's ready to drink."
Italy,85.0,10.0,Soave,Cantina di Soave,"You can't beat the price versus quality ratio on offer here. Yes, this is an easy and thin wine, but it also delivers just enough fruit freshness and personality to pair with easy vegetable dishes or salads. Great for pool side parties or barbecues."
US,88.0,55.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Two Vintners,"The Oliver red is a mix of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache from the excellent Olsen and Stone Tree vineyards. At four years of age it seems to be flattening out. The blueberry and cassis fruit, along with substantial savory notes, are smooth but not quite as lively as past vintages. Drink now."
US,91.0,58.0,Napa Valley,Stags' Leap Winery,"Small amounts of Malbec, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot punctuate this well-made wine, layered in red currant and cassis, with classic highlights of cedar and graphite. Softly integrated tannin and oak provide approachability, before a powerful, lingering finish."
Australia,89.0,20.0,Barossa Valley,Hewitson,"Smells leathery and savory, then folds in ripe, plummy fruit on the mouthfilling palate. Finishes supple and softly dusty. Ready to drink now."
US,92.0,48.0,Yakima Valley,JM Cellars,"Brooding blackberry, dark plum, dried herb, vanilla and bacon fat aromas are followed by sappy, rich, saturated fruit flavors in this wine. It's a hedonistic rendition of Syrah that holds nothing back."
France,87.0,60.0,Champagne,Soutiran,"Made, unusually, by skin contact rather than adding red wine, this rosÃ© is dark in color, with tannins as well as fruit. That gives it a rich character, full in the mouth and certainly putting it in the food-friendly category. It's an acquired taste because it is different."
US,89.0,34.0,Sonoma Coast,Failla,"This is a fine Pinot for drinking now. It's dry and brisk with coastal acidity, firm tannins and elaborate raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, touched by sweet, smoky oak."
US,90.0,38.0,Livermore Valley,Concannon,"This wine tames the notoriously stiff texture of the varietal with a little extra richness of fruit and a slight softening of the usual tannic mouthfeel. So it tastes generous, coating the palate with ripe boysenberry and black-pepper flavors, and finishing smooth. It's still a big wine, but won't need extended aging."
US,93.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"Something special from the west side of the Salinas Valley, with its fogs and wind. Drinks very bright in acids and even some tannins that frame a melange of flavors, including sweet lime, green apple, and the ripest white peach. Tastes leesy and has the texture of sweet cream. This distinctive wine defines Monterey's interpretation of Chardonnay."
France,84.0,13.0,Beaujolais,Thorin,"Bright red cherry fruits, fresh and light with fruit acidity and the minimum of tannins."
France,87.0,14.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Les Dauphins,"Passion fruit, kiwi fruit and hints of strawberry mark the nose of this wine. It's strident, intense and a bit one-dimensionally fruity, yet packs a lot of flavor into a refreshing, medium-bodied wine."
US,86.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Epiphany,"Sweet-tasting, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors abound in this Grenache-based blend. there are also notes of orange zest, grilled prosciutto, black pepper and sandalwood. The mouthfeel is simple, and the finish is a bit hot and heavy with glycerine."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Somontano,ViÃ±as del Vero,"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013."
US,82.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Red Pony Ranch,"With loads of oak, pineapple and orange honey flavors, this sweet Chardonnay will appeal to those who like this heavy, over-the-top style."
Spain,85.0,38.0,Extremadura,MarquÃ©s de Valdueza,"Gaseous berry aromas settle on pepper, oregano and earth tones. It feels tight, full and potent, with herbal, peppery flavors of black fruit and licorice. This turns more meaty and pumped up as it unfolds?much more rugged than refined."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Sicilia,Baglio di Pianetto,"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, bell pepper and cassis. The palate offers black cherry, cranberry, vanilla, mocha and oak alongside astringent, drying tannins."
US,89.0,33.0,Rockpile,Carol Shelton,"Marked by dryness and some heat from alcohol, this wine also has a rich core of ripe cherries. It's very strong and powerful, not a Zinfandel that's shy or apologizes for its brashness. But that's the essence of Rockpile. Drink this sturdy wine now, and the ideal food pairing is barbecue."
US,91.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,OS Winery,"This wine explores the variety's savory side, with aromas of fresh herbs, green pepper and dried tobacco followed by flowers and cherry. It brings suppleness and richness of flavor but also exceptionally well-balanced acidity with length to match, with cedar notes on the finish."
Spain,82.0,23.0,Ribera del Duero,MarquÃ©s de Vargas,"The 2013 vintage may not have been good in Spain, but this is really struggling. Green aromas are sharp and suggest vinegar. This feels hard as a pile of rocks, with herbal flavors of green tomato and rustic plum. An herbal-tasting astringent finish will win no new friends."
France,91.0,48.0,Chablis,Garnier et Fils,"This wine has the richness of 2009, while still is mineral, taut and textured. The yellow fruits are balanced by intense acidity and a ripe, full-bodied feel. The wine is complex, needing aging; the aftertaste intense, crisp and fruity."
US,86.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Kenwood,"A reductive nose distracts from the dusty oak, vanilla and robust peach and papaya notes in this food-friendly, round and approachable wine."
Italy,84.0,15.0,Asti,Mondoro,"Frothy cream and a thick white mousse cap this bright, sparkling Asti as the wine is poured in the glass. Floral and fruity aromas of jasmine and peach appear on the bouquet and the mouthfeel is silky and easy."
Italy,91.0,64.0,Franciacorta,Bellavista,"Fragrances recall acacia, white spring flowers, honey, bread dough and beeswax. The concentrated palate delivers mature yellow apple, toasted walnut, clove, vanilla and pie crust alongside vivacious, persistent effervescence."
Italy,89.0,139.0,Barolo,Mirafiore,"This opens with aromas suggesting toast, dark-skinned berry, smoke and a balsamic note. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, sage and a hint of clove alongside assertive tannins. Drink after 2020."
Spain,84.0,11.0,Rioja,Rio Madre,"Reedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act."
Australia,86.0,11.0,South Australia,Gotham,"Supple, round and ready to drink, this blend features hints of tomato leaf, watermelon and clove layered over ripe cherries. Drink now??016."
US,94.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Walt,"This is a bold, brawny red from a famous site, velvety in texture and all power and concentration. Forest floor and a touch of smoke complement juicy dark cherry, caramelized oak and licorice, while bright acidity supports the layers of flavor and strong tannins."
France,91.0,79.0,Gevrey-Chambertin,Louis Latour,"Structured and firm with fine red fruits and acidity, this is a wine that brings out all the structure of the appellation. It has acidity and red cherry and berry fruits that are shot through with a crisp texture. Drink from 2020."
Argentina,87.0,18.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Black fruit aromas feature a touch of licorice. Feels lively and alert, with edgy acids and juicy, forward flavors of plum and wild berry. Toasty, integrated and spicy on the finish, with pinches of green and black pepper."
France,85.0,11.0,Alsace,Dopff & Irion,"As its name suggests, this wine is meant to go with shellfish. Light and fruity, it's perfect background wine to highlight a variety of foods. Fresh acidity, citrus and delicate apple notes are enjoyable."
France,89.0,13.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau la Chapelle Maillard,"This ripe, concentrated wine is full of tannins and ripe blackberry fruit. It is still youthfully dry, but shows the potential to develop for 3?? years."
France,88.0,26.0,Gigondas,Andrieux & Fils,"This is a very drinkable Gigondas despite being very much in the savory-spicy style. Leather, garrigue, cinnamon and clove are the dominant notes, softened by silky tannins and modest cherry fruit. Drink now??015."
France,85.0,7.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Taussin,"Although obviously still young, this fruity wine will develop fast. It benefits from the ripe fruit of the vintage, sweet black currants and berries that are given a crisp edge by the acidity. Already balanced, it will be drinkable from 2016."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Alto Adige,Klaus Lentsch,"Subdued aromas suggesting yellow apple and a touch of citrus emerge after a few twirls of the glass. On the tangy palate, a vein of mineral and crisp acidity underscore juicy tastes of nectarine, pear and a hint of crystalized ginger."
France,88.0,20.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Lamothe-Bergeron,"This easy, early-developing wine has balanced tannins that lift the black-currant fruitiness and the fresh acidity. It is developing fast, with its fruit right to the front and the tannins in the background. Drink from 2017."
US,86.0,37.0,Dundee Hills,Archery Summit,"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made."
US,88.0,39.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Baer,"The Ursa blend is about 40% each of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the rest. Unsurprisingly, there is a forceful streak of herbal flavors running through this wine. It's more focused on the palate than the Star, with riper flavors of blackberry and bramble, albeit with plenty of pepper and stem."
US,84.0,39.0,Paso Robles,Cerro Prieto,"A vegetal note drags down the enjoyment. On the plus side, the wine is nice and silky, with good acidity and raspberry, cherry and fig flavors. But that tug of asparagus is a problem."
France,90.0,32.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"A fresh nose suggests both green and yellow pears. The palate shines with the freshness of both fruits?crisp, sunny, light and very fruity. The finish is clean and very refreshing."
US,89.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),DaMa,"This is a GSM blend from a single vineyard, Lonesome Springs. Tobacco and vanilla scents merge into a midpalate with light red fruits. The acidity and smooth tannins keep it clean and tasty through the finish."
US,92.0,50.0,Red Mountain,Matteo,"This is pure Chenin Blanc from Kiona's 1976 planting, fermented in concrete eggs and left on the lees for five months. A pretty golden hue, this bone dry wine did not undergo malolactic and has retained its sturdy acid base. Rich with glycerine, it's scented with and has flavors of lemon oil, orange peel and candied pineapple."
US,93.0,48.0,San Luis Obispo County,Presqu'ile,"From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria comes this exciting wine. Green and Kalamata olives show on the nose, along with crystallized cherry, juniper, fig, unripe strawberry and Mediterranean spice. It explodes with acidic life on the palate, where underripe cherry and tart strawberry flavors mix with green peppercorns, forest underbrush, wet gravel and thyme."
France,87.0,14.0,Alsace,Pierre and Charles Sparr,"A very perfumed, fragrant and refreshing wine. It is full in the mouth, ripe, smelling of hedgerow blossoms and having a touch of spring in its fruits. Ready to drink, but also keep until 2016."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Soave,Fattori,"Aromas of exotic fruit and candied citrus zest take center stage on this deeply colored white. Reflecting the scorching vintage, it's ripe and round, offering dried apricot and nectarine drop. Enjoy soon to capture the fruit and freshness."
US,90.0,35.0,Paso Robles,Lone Madrone,"There's a pleasant steel cut to a nose that also shows pressed red apple and dried white flowers on this blend of 37% Viognier, 31% Picpoul Blanc, 22% Roussanne and 10% Marsanne. The palate clings tightly to Japanese pear and yellow apples, showing some ripeness on the midpalate before returning to crisp rain-on-cement minerality."
US,91.0,49.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Black Ridge,"A beautiful Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, albeit a very young one that would be a shame to drink too early. The score indicates its current drinkability, but that could heighten over the next 6?? years. Shows a very firm tannic structure, with luscious black currant flavors that grow richer as the wine warms up in the glass."
Argentina,87.0,16.0,Mendoza,Argento,"Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right."
US,88.0,20.0,Clear Lake,Rosa d'Oro,"A deep, dark, robust Lake County Barbera, tame by Barbera standards, with softened tannins but lots of black licorice, fruit?rustic plum, mostly?and a hint of baked bread. Worth a try with meaty pasta dishes."
US,84.0,37.0,Paso Robles,Harmony Cellars,"There are some tough, astringent tannins in this wine that make it harsh on the palate and bitter on the finish. The actual flavors are of cola, raisins and black currants. Doesn't seem like an ager."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Lago di Corbara,Barberani,"What a surprise to find such a delicate and berry-driven Pinot Nero from sunny Umbria in central Italy. This tastes very much like a Pinot you'd find in any northern region with feminine fruit and floral nuances lavished over by raspberry, vanilla, honey, cola and lavender. It's fragrant and buoyant in the mouth with loads of personality and bright acidity on the close: a pleasure to drink."
Australia,88.0,15.0,Australia,Jacob's Creek,"California winemaker Ehren Jordan contributed to the making of this wine in partnership with Australian Bernard Hickin, hence the Two Lands moniker. It's a solid wine for the price, delivering subtle toasted-grain notes, vanilla and citrus custard flavors and a reasonably full, creamy texture. Drink now."
US,91.0,70.0,Chalk Hill,Chalk Hill,"This behemoth is all gristle and power, voluptuously combining 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Malbec, 9% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot, 4% Syrah and 2% Carmenere in a mad scientist's way. Velvety, it's beyond full-bodied in blackberry and chocolate, integrated in terms of oak, with a splash of black pepper and tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2022."
Italy,92.0,48.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Villa Monteleone,"Elegant lines distinguish this wine, making it a fantastic choice with almost any hearty meat dish. Notes of chocolate, espresso, cherry and sweet, toasted vanilla characterize the bouquet, giving this Amarone a modern, forward feel. The finish is long, luscious and driven by a melted chocolate flavor."
Italy,94.0,80.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Speri,"From one of the Valpolicella's best producers, this vineyard-designate Amarone is amazingly soft and velvety, with aromas of softly worn leather, moist chewing tobacco, ripe black cherry and barbecue smoke. It's an elegant but modern rendition, showing power, intensity and impressive length. Best yet, the fruit is young enough to promise more years of graceful aging."
US,90.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Amity,"Dark in color and flavor, the Crannell brings ripe fruit flavors of black cherry and prune. Smooth and full-bodied, with an easy-drinking roundness to the mouthfeel, it finishes softly with all components well integrated."
France,90.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Bourg,ChÃ¢teau MÃ©tairie Neuve,"From a 34-acre property that has vines both in Blaye and Bourg, this is concentrated, showing the ripe, generous fruit of the vintage. Still youthful, its blackberry juiciness lies behind its wood-aging flavors. Drink from 2020."
US,87.0,12.0,Finger Lakes,Prejean,"A spray of lime pith mingles with white florals on the nose and palate of Prejean's Dry Riesling. It's dry on the palate, but softened considerably by a gorgeously concentrated apricot and white peach fruit profile."
US,90.0,27.0,Yakima Valley,Tapteil Vineyard,"Threads of licorice, steel, earth and smoke weave through the proportionate strawberry and raspberry flavors, offset by hints of herb and baking spice. It's a seamless, complex wine of moderate length."
France,90.0,30.0,Alsace,Domaine Gresser,"Full and ripe, this has a pure, fragrant fruitiness. Its structure and freshness add a delicious drinkability to this rich wine. Age for another year."
US,91.0,22.0,North Fork of Long Island,Paumanok,"Juicy mango and yellow peach flavors are intensified by a mineral slick in this gorgeously textured wine. A jolt of lime on the midpalate gives edge to silky layers of fruit, exposing a lingering honeycomb finish. Complex yet light bodied and quaffable, it's a new benchmark for Long Island Riesling."
US,88.0,18.0,Virginia,Old House,"A Cabernet Franc with Pinot Noir-like charm, this bears an aromatic admixture of macerated cherries, strawberry preserves, mushroom caps and leather. Light to medium bodied, this has graceful, dusty tannins and acids that have some spark."
France,90.0,65.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau de l'Annonciation,"This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017."
US,91.0,18.0,Santa Maria Valley,J Wilkes,"This is a very accessible white wine for those seeking a reliable alternative that's both bright and flavorful. Aromas of coconut, poached pear, chamomile and white flowers show on the broadly painted nose, while the palate is clean and crisp with apple, zippy acidity and a chalky minerality."
Italy,90.0,75.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Santi,"Proemio has a bouquet of mature black fruit and mushroom, layered with bitter almond. The warm palate delivers ripe raspberry and prune flavors, accented by black pepper and nutmeg. This is already developing complexity but is fast approaching its ideal drinking window, so enjoy soon."
US,88.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,Uptick Vineyards,"Made from a 50-50 split of Pinot Noir and Syrah, this pinkish wine is medium bodied and intensely electric in acidity, a taste of wild strawberry and waxy apple at its core. Lemony, it remains dry on the palate throughout, with some girth on the finish."
France,87.0,9.0,Languedoc,Laroche,"Floral scents of carnation, baby's breath and garrigue abound on the nose of this bright rosÃ©. Notes of small red cherry and berry ground the herbal character, while pure, citrusy acidity enlivens the palate. Drink this direct but attractive gem now."
France,87.0,17.0,Cahors,Georges Vigouroux,"While this could be considered the equivalent of a second wine for the ChÃ¢teau Pech de Jammes estate, it is in a modern, fruity style, which sets it apart from the ChÃ¢teau wine. Bold, ripe and generous fruits give blackberry flavors alongside a lively, perfumed character. The wine is ready to drink."
US,87.0,56.0,Coombsville,Richard Perry,"While bottled for four years now, this Cabernet is still developing bottle-aged notes. It's rich and jammy with blackberries, blueberries, cherries and mocha, along with a good overlay of oak. It's a pleasant wine to drink over the next few years."
Australia,92.0,25.0,Hunter Valley,Tyrrell's,"The Tyrrell family was excited about its 2014s when I visited there earlier this year, and this suggests their ebullience is well founded. The aromas are fresh and floral, loaded with cherry-berry fruit and a hint of cracked pepper, while on the palate, the wine is medium bodied and supple, with a long, peppery, silky finish."
Italy,90.0,88.0,Franciacorta,Ca' del Bosco,"Buttered baguette, apricot, chestnut honey and yellow rose describe the fragrant nose of this luminous sparkling wine from northern Italy. It boasts well-integrated acidity and lively freshness on the close."
US,91.0,100.0,Columbia Valley (WA),J. Bookwalter,"All Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers reserved aromas of dried herbs, toffee and high-toned dark fruit. The black fruit flavors are full and generous but still elegant with a pronounced finish."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Alto Adige,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro,"This structured Pinot Grigio boasts aromas of yellow spring flowers, exotic fruit, citrus and a hint of Alpine herbs. The juicy, vibrant palate delivers green apple, pear, white peach and citrus allied with fresh acidity."
US,87.0,40.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Tertulia,"Aromas of whole green pepper, hot spice, cherry and baking spice are followed by lighter styled, tart, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors."
US,86.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Wagner,"Lively and fresh with a floral and lemon citrus character in the nose and on the palate, this full-bodied GewÃ¼rtz offers lovely aromas and full-bodied flavors. Dry in style with a clean character. Pair with Indian or Asian cuisine or grilled chicken."
Argentina,87.0,19.0,Valle de Uco,Cruzat,"Dusty citrus aromas show a hint of butterscotch. This feels about right, with modest lift coming from mild acidity. Dry simple flavors of white pepper and generic bitterness close this out."
US,90.0,45.0,Chalk Hill,Chalk Hill,"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors. Complex and intriguing, this unfined, unfiltered Chard should drink well for the next few years."
US,86.0,28.0,Paso Robles,Still Waters,"Grape soda, prune, leather, graphite, dust and black tobacco blend into an intriguing nose on this estate Malbec from Paso's Eastside. It's a little rustic around the edges once sipped, but pleasantly so. The mouthfeel is soft, the flavors are peppery and the tannins and acidity are built to last."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Alto Adige Valle Isarco,Abbazia di Novacella,"Subtle aromas of beeswax, white spring flower and a whiff of pear mingle in the glass. The linear palate offers crunchy green apple, nectarine zest and ground white pepper alongside brisk acidity. It's very pretty and extremely refreshing."
Italy,87.0,27.0,Barolo,Cantina Terre del Barolo,"Aromas of cellar floor, underbrush and stewed prune open. The straightforward palate offers dark cherry, raspberry, toast and white pepper. Drink through 2020."
US,85.0,20.0,Oakville,Flora Springs,"Good structure on this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, with crisp acidity and even some nice, dusty tannins. But the pineapple, Meyer lemon and lime flavors are too sugary sweet for a dry table wine."
Australia,91.0,25.0,Adelaide Hills,Sidewood,"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp."
US,85.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Lucky Rock Wine Co.,"Thick and dense in oak, this is a basic and generic version of the variety. Medium in weight it hints at elements of forest floor, tea and black cherry fruit."
France,85.0,12.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Clos des Menuts,"The classic Bordeaux white blend of Sauvignon Blanc and SÃ©millon has produced a light and fruity wine. It has some attractive green plum and currant flavors that are lined with clean, pure acidity. Drink the wine now."
US,88.0,38.0,Green Valley,Iron Horse,"This is one of Iron Horse's sweeter sparkling wines. There's a sugary edge to the raspberry, strawberry, lime and orange flavors. But it's not too sweet, and there's plenty of balancing acidity. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay."
France,86.0,17.0,Bordeaux Clairet,ChÃ¢teau Vignol,"With an edge of tannin and with sweet strawberry fruits, this Doublet family clairet is an attractive wine. Dark pink in color, it appears and tastes rich. With its peppery aftertaste, this has to be a wine designed for food."
Italy,91.0,79.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenuta Oliveto,"This wine definitely shows a ripe side in its cured meat, tobacco, sandalwood, smoked bacon and old spice. Delivers a rich, plump feel in the mouth, backed by gritty tannins and bright acidity. Despite the cooler vintage, this wine packs power, heat and a tiny touch of sweetness on the close."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Prosecco,Andreola,"Aromas of exotic fruit carry over to the off-dry palate along with white stone fruit, candied citrus peel and a note of glazed pastry. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors."
Argentina,87.0,14.0,Mendoza,Hacienda del Plata,"Cherry, cassis and spice aromas are mild and comported. The wine feels chewy and just dense enough, with baked cassis, berry and herb flavors that finish toasty and hot, with a rubbery note. Clean aromas and full fruit flavors are this wine's best attributes."
Italy,86.0,28.0,Friuli Venezia Giulia,Colutta,"Colutta is a fun and consistent producer from northeast Italy who works with a long list of indigenous grapes. This sparkling Ribolla Gialla is redolent of exotic spice, stone fruit and dried herb. There's a very perky and sharp quality to the close."
Italy,90.0,65.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Montresor,"Cherry liqueur, smoke, black pepper, licorice, brown sugar, hummus and steak sauce open the nose of this hearty Amarone. Sweet fruit flavors that recall prune, raisin and currant characterize the close and add a sweet, succulent note to the overall picture."
US,89.0,17.0,Paso Robles,J. Lohr,"This wine strikes a wide purple fruit note at first before centering on plum jam, wood smoke and a licorice element. On the palate, medium tannins frame a medium and smooth mouthfeel, with flavors of tobacco leaf giving way to richer coffee and woody elderberry flavors."
France,86.0,23.0,Moulin-Ã -Vent,Domaine du Haut-PonciÃ©,Some wood aging gives the fruitiness of the wine an added spice. Tannins support the bitter cherry flavors and add firmness to the juicy acidity. Drink from the end of 2015.
US,92.0,100.0,Spring Mountain District,Frias,"A near twin to the excellent 2006, and as ageable. It's a big wine, but immature, with scads of blackberry and cherry jam fruit, smoky new oak and stiff tannins. Give it eight years to let everything mellow together, and it should hold until at least 2020."
Spain,86.0,9.0,PenedÃ¨s,Cristalino,"There?s plenty of enjoyment in this modestly priced wine, which has dusty, earthy aromas and just the slightest hint of citrus and melon. It?s very dry and faintly fruity. Has a bit of a scouring quality from high acidity, and it?s rough, but it?s exceptionally clean and brisk."
US,89.0,26.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"Bold and substantial, this full-bodied and firmly tannic wine has a good core of ripe black berry and black cherry trimmed with lighter cinnamon and vanilla notes from oak. It's very attractive in a firm, palate-gripping way."
Italy,90.0,100.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Podere Brizio,"This is a delicate and harmonious wine with a large offering of fragrant aromas that are doled out in measured, careful doses. You'll get chocolate and coffee shavings next to earthy tones, Porcini mushroom, forest floor and a delicate embroidery of small berry fruit. It's a distinctive wine with tight tannins, solid structure and a fresh, clean finish."
US,84.0,17.0,Grand River Valley,DebonnÃ©,"This is a vibrant, energetic Chardonnay that starts with fresh aromas of lemon zest, vanilla and spice and follows with appealing flavors of lemon, spice and citrus. Food- friendly and versatile."
US,90.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,David Bruce,"This is a broad-shouldered, full-bodied wine that shows true varietal character in its mix of earthy, spicy strawberry and cherry notes."
France,85.0,10.0,Vin de France,Vindivin,"This crisp, clean and zesty wine is lightly herbal and immediately appealing. It's full of citrus and gooseberry flavors and is ready to drink."
France,93.0,103.0,Champagne,Pol Roger,"From start to finish, this top quality vintage follows a straight line. It starts with freshness and explodes into richness. The initial very tight structure soon opens out with white pears and green plums, soft and ripe. The fruit is supported by the structure which offers orange zest. Like many 1999s, this is almost ready to drink."
US,90.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Acacia,"This wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core. For fans of a rich style, it will impress for  its ripe, dark fruit and sizable yet velvety mouthfeel."
Spain,89.0,14.0,Cava,Freixenet,"This is a serious Cava for the money. It's mildly briny and dusty up front, with peach and apple notes filling out the nose. The palate is elegant and smooth enough, while apple and melon flavors are naturally spicy and ripe given the warm conditions of the '09 vintage. The long, nectarine-flavored finish will win you over."
US,92.0,50.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"Named for the soil layers important to wine's terroir, this Pinot is sourced from a variety of sites and multiple clones, providing a complexity of wild strawberry, high acidity and an herbaceous, oaky backdrop. A teasing kiss of toffee and chocolate on the finish is deliciously intriguing."
France,89.0,18.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Domaine des Marrans,"This is a ripe and structured wine of red fruits and fine acidity. With its tannins and tangy edge, it has a dry core that gives it a great chance with food."
France,93.0,39.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Olivier,"This has smooth, rich fruit, with sweet berries, ripe tannins and strong layers of wood. The wine is powerful; the stalky and bitter chocolate edge contrasts the sweet, ripe fruit. This is meant for long-term aging."
Spain,82.0,21.0,Ribera del Duero,Hemar,"An herbal and brambly roughneck with forced aromas, lots of leather, and ultimately cranberry and other tart red-fruit flavors. Not much body, and thus it's short and piquant."
Italy,86.0,50.0,Terre del Volturno,Vestini Campagnano,"This wine opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, tire rubber, coffee and mature black fruit. The palate is also dominated by wood sensations, offering oak extract, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and espresso that smother the hints of ripe black plum that peek through."
US,84.0,42.0,Sonoma Valley,Ty Caton,"A hard wine to like, although it's clean and without technical flaws. Tastes very oaky now, with hard grapeskin and oak tannins giving an astringency to the superripe blackberry and cherry jelly flavors."
US,90.0,35.0,Santa Barbara County,Steele,"Here's a supple, delicious Pinot Noir. The wine is elegantly silky, with satisfying flavors of cherries, currants, Dr. Pepper, smoky vanilla and fresh ProvenÃ§al herbs. It has a good edge of tannins."
US,93.0,105.0,Stags Leap District,Chimney Rock,"A textbook illustration of Stags Leap Cabernet. The ?velvet glove??is the elaborately ripe, sweet blackberry, cherry and chocolate fruit. The ?iron fist??is the tannin structure, so finely woven you hardly notice it, but there it is, offering a coat of astringency and protecting the wine over the next decade."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Chianti Rufina,Castello del Trebbio,"Lastricato Riserva is a compact and traditional wine with fine texture, a tight feel and bright aromas of forest berry, white cherry and almond skin. Those elegant, subtle qualities make this a good selection for chicken or white meat."
Italy,88.0,37.0,Barbaresco,Ca' del Baio,"Dark spice, camphor, menthol and crushed herb aromas take center stage in this wine. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and licorice flavors alongside assertive, close-grained tannins. A hint of candied orange zest signals the close."
US,81.0,19.0,California,One Hope,"This quirky medium-bodied wine has a flavor spectrum all its own. It smells floral and tastes like spiced red candy, and is noticeably sweet."
US,82.0,15.0,Central Coast,Clayhouse,"A rugged wine, with harsh tannins and a green, unripe taste to the cherry-berry flavors."
US,93.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,Two Vintners,"This vineyard is best known for its Syrah but Grenache also shines, as evidenced by this compelling bottle. The aromas pop with complex notes of flowers, brown stems, mineral, smoke, raspberries, peppery spice and the vineyard's signature earthy funk. The palate shows delicacy, precision and detail, with a lightly meaty, peppery finish that lingers. It's a completely captivating expression of the variety with balance that downright dazzles."
US,88.0,32.0,Willamette Valley,Chehalem,"This blend of the three estate vineyards is the first Pinot to be released from each vintage. Here it spent time in 22% oak, roughly half new. Cranberry, pomengranate, dried herbs and some gently earthy tannins combine in a tart, gulpable style."
Spain,85.0,10.0,Rioja,Montecillo,"Angular and tasty, Montecillo's regular offering  is an appealing, uncomplicated ready-to-drink red. Dried fruit, herb and oak flavors meld nicely in this light-medium weight wine best for drinking now through 2004. Best Buy. ?M.M."
France,85.0,60.0,Champagne,Luc MÃ©rat,"Full and rich, this is ripe with red berry-fruit flavors. Orange-pink in color, the wine, despite its acidity, seems heavy. The aftertaste is soft and rounded, with strawberry flavors."
US,89.0,22.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gainey,"Dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and with a firm steeliness to the citrus and tropical fruits, this Chardonnay is fancy enough to drink with rich fare, like crab. It shows the elegance of the Santa Rita Hills, at a fair price."
US,92.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Aubichon Cellars,"This shows some extra concentration in its plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel has a pleasing texture, and the streaks of herb and cola are nicely integrated. As with many of the wines of this vintage, it's forward and fruit-driven and ready for immediate enjoyment."
US,84.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Cinnabar,"Briary berry and cedar flavors are marred by less ripe notes of green herbs. It's dry, tannic and spicy."
Italy,88.0,48.0,Sicilia,Abbazia Santa Anastasia,"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge?almost too much?emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot."
US,85.0,40.0,Carneros,Isabel Mondavi,"Intensely oaky, this Carneros Pinot is brooding in ripe plum fruit and straightforwardly layered with approachable fruit flavor and mellowing tannins. Enjoy now."
US,88.0,25.0,Virginia,Horton,"A grape known in Uruguay and Madiran has proved to show well in Virginia and this is a solid example. This wine has a pronounced nose of red berries, barnyard and purple flowers. Flavors of raspberry, cranberry, red plum and violet ease the way into more spicy and charred notes. A firm tannic grip is softened by zippy acidity that gives the palate a nice lift."
US,88.0,20.0,Central Coast,Martin Ranch,"Coming from a slightly warmer part of the Central Coast, this bottling plays to the dried fruit and earthy side of the grape, with cranberry, hibiscus, turned loam and pencil shavings on the nose. Dense black-plum flavors show on the palate alongside crushed lava rocks, turned soil, juniper and dried pine needles."
France,85.0,15.0,Bourgogne AligotÃ©,Vignerons de Buxy,"This fruity, ready-to-drink wine is crisp and packed with citrus and grapefruit flavors. With bright final acidity, it is refreshing and herbal."
US,89.0,28.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Betwixt,"From a winery located below Bernal Heights in San Francisco, this wine offers rich aromas of thick, chewy Meyer lemon pith, lightly toasted sourdough bread, toasted almonds, struck match and the slightest hint of browned butter. The palate is intriguingly tart, oily in texture and quite powerful, with cooked lemon rinds, lemon creme brÃ»lÃ©e and marcona almond oil flavors."
US,87.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Maroon,"Marked by strong, ripe fruit, this Cab is a bit one-dimensional. It offers waves of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak, and has a soft, melted mouthfeel. Seems at its best now."
Australia,89.0,20.0,Margaret River,Robert Oatley,"Aromatic in style, this veers on the side of perfume on the nose. Nevertheless, it's very likable. Red apple skins and florals lead on the palate that's a little soapy, but is well balanced and stylish. More red apple lingers on the finish. Drink now??020."
US,89.0,90.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Alleromb,"High-toned aromas of dried herbs, cocoa, licorice, woodspice and blackberry lead to full-bodied yet elegantly styled black fruit flavors, with the tannins showing some grit."
France,85.0,11.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Blaignac,"Fresh and fragrant, this is a lively, bright and tangy wine. With crisp acidity and raspberry fruit that is twisted with orange peel it is ready to drink."
France,86.0,20.0,Sancerre,Joseph Mellot,"Ripe and creamy wine, with some herbaceousness and yellow fruits. Layering citrus and a tangy texture, it's fruity, full of lively acidity and ready to drink this year. Screwcap."
US,88.0,24.0,Santa Maria Valley,Mattina Fiore,"This saignÃ©e blend of Grenache and Syrah offers buttered strawberries and cherry juice on the playful and fun nose. There's a touch of effervescence on the lively, acidic palate, with flavors of berry-spiked lemonade and watermelon bubble gum."
France,90.0,50.0,Francs CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Marsau,"A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine."
France,87.0,50.0,Champagne,Heidsieck & Co Monopole,"Delicacy and finesse mark this pretty wine. From the slight lime and vanilla aromas to the light, effervescent citrus flavors, it hits all the right notes of elegance. Finishes toasty and clean. This is an easy-to-drink, likable Champagne."
France,89.0,17.0,Saint-Amour,Jean Loron,Billards is the name of a small area of Saint-Amour. The cru wine from this vineyard is richly structured and packed with juicy black fruits. There is a mineral texture from the granite subsoil that gives the wine its structure. Drink from late 2017.
Italy,86.0,24.0,Soave,La Cappuccina,"Pressed yellow flower, dried fruit and toasted oak aromas lead the nose. The lean palate offers candied citrus zest, vanilla and drying, wood-driven sensations but not much fruit richness. It finishes on a bitter, nutty note."
US,89.0,18.0,Fair Play,M2,"Full bodied and opulent in texture, this wine was grown at high elevation and relies more on its luscious mouthfeel than its subdued fruit flavors for appeal. While dry, the wine has attractive viscosity and a lingering finish."
US,87.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Amici,"Blended with 50% Sauvignon Musque that gives it a distinctly floral note, this wine has just a touch of oak, which gives it some smoky toastiness. It's quite tart in citrusy acidity that gets the mouth watering. Flavorwise, the lemon, lime, and guava flavors have a strong cut of tart, green gooseberries."
US,87.0,45.0,Sonoma Valley,Westwood,"A bit heavy for a Pinot Noir, lacking the lively zest the grape needs in California to balance the ripe fruit. Flavors range through blackberries and plums, with oak complications. Quite good, but doesn't seem like an ager."
US,90.0,16.0,Central Coast,Sextant,"This wine from San Ardo Ranch in the San Lucas appellation wins against Zins twice the price. Black cherry and blackberry aromas meet with sensuous lilacs and wet asphalt on the nose. The palate's cherry juice front quickly turns to tobacco, dried blueberry and a tarry, dried-berry finish."
Spain,85.0,15.0,Somontano,BatÃ¡n de Salas,"Oaky resiny spicy aromas are an indicator of what's to come. This has a scratchy mouthfeel and resiny notes akin to licking a plank of wood. A heavily oaked flavor profile tastes mostly of dry wood and clove. On the finish, wood-spice flavors and drying tannins are in control and don't let go."
Argentina,92.0,75.0,Mendoza,Matias Riccitelli,"This power-packed new Malbec from the son of legendary Mendoza winemaker Jorge Riccitelli shows lush blackberry and cassis aromas along with burnt toast and graphite notes. A huge, saturated palate is resiny and chewy, while flavors of baked black fruits are oaky and savory, with a saucy finish that's bulky. This is full, chunky and delicious; drink through 2024."
US,87.0,10.0,California,Rare,"This wine tastes like a rosÃ© Champagne without the bubbles. It has a classic light salmon color, light aromas like white cherries and raspberries, and a surprisingly layered texure that curls around the tongue. And what a great value, too."
US,88.0,8.0,California,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,"Crisp in a very good way, this wine has lively lemon and green-apple aromas, flavors that are a bit riper than that and a texture that's smooth without giving up a little nip of acidity. The wine has great balance, light body and a high refreshment quotient."
France,92.0,65.0,Champagne,Ayala,"A ripe, soft wine that still does manage to preserve the Ayala lightness of touch. The fruit is green apple and pink grapefruit, with great freshness. The structure, though, is open and hints of yeast show through the fruit. The aftertaste is deliciously fresh."
France,87.0,28.0,Santenay,Domaine Jessiaume,"Jessiaume is based in Santenay and the wine shows the attraction of this village at the southern end of the CÃ´te de Beaune. It reveals soft fruit, warmed by a jammy layer of red berries and ripe acidity."
US,88.0,19.0,Lodi,Klinker Brick,"This is a great wine for fans of the flashy, almost sweet, dark colored and fully oaked style of Zin. It has a tasty sense of maple syrup on waffles, boysenberries and vanilla. Full-bodied and concentrated, it's firm in texture and slightly sweet on the finish."
US,92.0,23.0,Russian River Valley,Trione,"Pressed and fermented in stainless steel vats and partially aged in neutral oak, this wine rewards in a vibrancy of grapefruit, tangerine and peach flavors, allowing space for a plush texture through the long-lasting brightness of the fruit."
US,90.0,39.0,Fair Play,Cedarville Vineyard,"Cedarville's estate-grown, Priorat-inspired blend of 45% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, is well made and inclined to age. It's still soft and oaky with a hint of leathery cassis and game. Imagine a Spanish fiesta for this food-friendly wine."
US,93.0,115.0,Rutherford,Judge Palmer,"Inviting, exotic coconut and vanilla scents give this vineyard designate a tropical flourish before more traditional cassis and cherry notes take the lead. Bright acidity counters velvety texture as the wine unfurls its underlying grip of tannin. Approachably rich, it rewards with full flavor and body."
Italy,92.0,25.0,Greco di Tufo,Mastroberardino,"From the family firm that resurrected native grape Greco, this structured, elegant wine offers rich peach, apple and citrus flavors accented with intense mineral, spice and aromatic herbs. Crisp acidity beautifully balances the rich flavors. Drink 2017??022."
US,87.0,20.0,Idaho,Colter's Creek,"Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red."
Italy,88.0,65.0,Toscana,Diadema,"Made with Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with aromas of raspberry jam and underbrush along with whiffs of coffee and vanilla. The medium-bodied palate delivers mature plum, vanilla and white pepper alongside smooth tannins."
US,90.0,49.0,Russian River Valley,Siduri,"A waft of freshly baked baguette unfurls on the nose of this wine, followed by sautÃ©ed mushroom scents, giving it earthy character. Soft and round on the palate, the fruit tends toward darker, lusher notes of blueberry and plum."
France,86.0,10.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Henry Fessy,"This merchant house, with labels that carry a classic Frenchman's mustache, has made a soft rounded wine with attractive red-berry fruits. It is juicy and full of acidity that finishes the wine with a crisp aftertaste."
Italy,92.0,66.0,Roero,Negro Angelo e Figli,"Aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, toasted hazelnut, espresso, menthol and oak-driven spice meld together in the glass. The concentrated, full-bodied palate boasts succulent black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, vanilla and sage framed in velvety tannins that give this a polished texture. Drink 2018??027."
Italy,89.0,45.0,Barbaresco,Marchesi di Barolo,"Classic Nebbiolo aromas of violet, wild berry and a whiff of baking spice float out of the glass on this attractive red. The elegantly structured palate offers mature wild cherry, cinnamon, white pepper and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017??022."
France,88.0,18.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Barbanau,"Rich and juicy, this has tannins and wood-aging flavors that are already well integrated into the ripe, jammy berry fruits. The wine is still young, although it can be drunk now. Better to wait until 2017."
Italy,92.0,47.0,Barolo,Ca' Viola,"Aromas suggest ripe blackberry, baking spice, mocha and a balsamic note of menthol. The brooding palate opens with mature black cherry, savory herb and black pepper alongside tightly knit but velvety tannins that still need to unwind. Drink 2016??021."
Italy,88.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Cencioni Patrizia,"Dark-skinned berry, forest floor and coconut touches lead the nose. The dense, full-bodied palate evokes fleshy black cherry, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors, all set against chewy tannins. Drink through 2022."
France,87.0,39.0,Champagne,Chassenay d'Arce,"This is a simple, fruity Champagne, made to be drunk young. With its crisp citrus tang and bright acidity, it is well balanced with the soft dosage. The wine is dominated by Pinot Noir that grows so well in the CÃ´te des Bar."
France,85.0,16.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Louis Chevallier,"This wine is soft, simple, fruity and ready to drink. It has apple and apricot tones and light acidity to keep it fresh, with a bright and refreshing aftertaste."
US,92.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Vine Cliff,"Brawny, with an explosive concentration of blackberry, this intense wine offers hints of tobacco, smoked meat and black licorice elevated on the palate. Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, it finishes on a bittersweet note and with some black pepper. Cellar through 2020."
Italy,91.0,99.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Tedeschi,"You'll discover aromas of leafy underbrush, grilled herb, raisin, new leather and a whiff of blue flower on this bold red. The syrupy concentrated palate doles out raspberry jam, stewed prune, anise and nutmeg framed in big chewy tannins. A confectionery note closes the finish."
France,94.0,66.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Domaine de la Janasse,"A terrific value among top-flight ChÃ¢teauneufs, even Janasse's entry-level wine excels in 2010. Sexy leather and suede trappings embrace ripe cherry and chocolate notes, while the palate exudes lushness yet retains enough firmness on the finish to suggest a lifespan of at least 6?? years."
US,94.0,60.0,Carneros,Hartford,"There's a sweet fruit and pastry quality to this wine that's reminiscent of a cherry tart, with its vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon and smoky buttery pie crust flavors. It's very delicious but also brilliantly structured as a wine, with fine tannins and a sunburst of citrusy acids. One of the best Carneros Pinots of the vintage, it will provide pleasurable drinking now??013 at the least."
France,90.0,32.0,Vacqueyras,Famille Perrin,"Full bodied and richly textured, this wine stood out in a flight of southern RhÃ´nes for its obvious oak. It's a toasty, cedary, vanilla-laden wine, but with enough fruit weight to support the wood. Drink it now if you like that style, or give it a few years' in the cellar and see if the fruit emerges over time."
US,88.0,55.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Fess Parker,"This is a big, dense Pinot Noir, and quite a good one, although it's a bit sharp in acidity. Really packs in the black cherry and oak flavors, with a long, red licorice finish, but it's immature, and needs time to come together. Give it 2?? years."
US,96.0,62.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip."
France,84.0,11.0,Vin de Pays du Val de Loire,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"A fresh, simple wine with an edge of earthiness and flavors of soft caramel and apricot skin. There is a green herbal character leading into the light, crisp finish."
US,88.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"A soft and layered expression of dense black cherry, chocolate and spicy tobacco, this is easy to enjoy and approachable, rich and round. A taste of black licorice dots the finishing moments."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Lison-Pramaggiore,Beccarello,"Made with air-dried Tocai Friulano grapes (now simply called Friulano), this golden wine opens with apricot tones, peach, candied fruit and honey. It's a simple, clean sweet wine with a crisp touch of acidity on the finish."
US,92.0,60.0,Russian River Valley,Merry Edwards,"Planted on a relatively cool site for the Russian River, the Laguna Ridge, this Pinot is velvety and lush in baked strawberry and black raspberry, a celebration of finely grown, ripe fruit, with sharp-edged acidity and waves of savory mocha. With pronounced oak that mellows in the glass, it should only become more interesting with a few more years in the cellar, through 2022."
France,86.0,18.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Brigue,"Soft and ripe, this has attractive red-berry fruits that are layered with acidity and tangerine flavor. It's delicate, light hearted, and great as an apÃ©ritif."
Italy,90.0,169.0,Chianti Classico,Castello di Ama,". There's a compact, traditional characteristic here that gives this wine smooth, sophisticated appeal. Aromas include white cherry, dried raspberry, tar, licorice and root beer. Twenty percent Malvasia Nera is added to the blend."
Italy,87.0,13.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,"Syrah finds a perfect home in Sicily. The sea breezes and sunny weather help give ripe aromas of blackberry, cherry, tobacco and smoked bacon. It exudes a spicy touch of barbecue sauce, with gritty tannins that give the wine texture, richness and power."
US,84.0,24.0,Central Coast,Jason-Stephens,"Overly soft and simple and quite sugary sweet, like an inexpensive Port-style wine. Shows flavors of berries, currants and chocolate. Drink now."
US,89.0,49.0,Sonoma Coast,MacPhail,"This wine initially presents itself as lighter in body than it actually is, a tease from the cool-climate aromas of cucumber, dill and cranberry tea. The oak is toasty with a whiff of smoke, the acidity somewhat subdued. An appealing funk of earth gives it varietal distinction."
France,89.0,25.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Domaine CÃ©drick Bardin,"With grapes from 40-year-old vines, this is a dense and concentrated wine. Yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus flavors give a balance between richness and freshness. It has high alcohol that shows in the light pepper edge although this doesn't detract from the fruitiness of the aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
France,90.0,42.0,Alsace,Domaine FranÃ§ois Schmitt,"Lemon notes are subdued by earth on the nose but they shine on a rather textured, palate that needs some air to open up. There is concentration at the core and generous freshness that lights up everything. Subtle but totally worthwhile with a clean lemon finish."
US,95.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Aberrant Cellars,"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage. Blackberry and black cherry fruit, adorned with a sprinkling of Sumatra coffee beans, rocks on with polished tannins. The pleasing roasted character is just right to power it through a clean, sexy finish. Drink now and on through 2026."
France,91.0,75.0,Hermitage,Ferraton Pere et Fils,"This is rich, honeyed and ripe on the nose and full-bodied and round in the mouth, with just enough acidity to provide backbone and length. The peach, melon and citrus notes linger on the mouthwatering finish."
US,92.0,60.0,Sonoma Coast,Lutum,"Winemaker Gavin Chanin's co-effort with Durell owner Bill Price aims to show vibrancy and freshness of fruit and succeeds on both counts in this light-bodied, complex wine. Clove, rich, dark cherry and bright acidity combine for a fresh take on a typically voluptuous vineyard, finding the layers of rocky minerality that lie beneath."
US,84.0,19.0,Finger Lakes,Bellangelo,"Smoky, elegant and soft aromas of leather, pepper and berry lead into flavors of cherry and cigarbox spice on the palate of this approachable Cabernet. The wine is not terribly complex, but good structure and acidity give it cellaring potential, and paired with duck, lamb or beef dishes, it will make a very nice addition to the table."
Spain,85.0,13.0,Rioja,Palacio del Burgo,Open-grained oak aromas dominate a toasty nose with heat. This feels lean and tomatoey. Flavors of tart plum and pie cherry are almost sour and feel edgy due to severe wood tannins.
Italy,89.0,18.0,Alto Adige,St. Pauls,"This elegant wine opens with fragrances of white flowers and green apple. The silky palate offers ripe pear, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean, bright finish."
France,88.0,17.0,Alsace,Jean-Marc Bernhard,"A touch of yeasty funk still clings to the pear-fruit nose. The palate brims with ripe juicy pear, helped along by some residual sweetness, and is contained by a pleasantly bitter zestiness. The body is slender but rounded and pervasive. A lively freshness lets it finish dry."
France,88.0,22.0,Morgon,Domaine de la Combe au Loup,"Structured and still dense, this will need aging to bring out all the fruit. For now, it has a dark, textured character, full of tannins and minerality. It just hints at the juicy acidity that will follow. Drink from 2015."
Australia,89.0,75.0,Yarra Valley,Yarra Yering,"This wine's aromas and flavors amount to an inconsistent mix of superripe (chocolate and prune) notes with those that are less so (herbal, tart raspberry) at first, but it does seem to settle down with some time in the glass, becoming more integrated but staying rather crisp on the finish. Drink 2013??020."
US,87.0,18.0,Yolo County,Rock Wall,"A wisp of a wine that's dark-salmon in color, this is made entirely from Grenache grapes grown near the town of Davis. It's dry, light and fun, offering a strawberry and watermelon fruitiness, with a trace of spice on the end."
Italy,87.0,50.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Le Casalte,"Here's an earthy expression of Sangiovese that opens with aromas of truffle, forest floor, ripe plum and a whiff of barnyard. The rustic appeal carries over to the palate, which offers ripe blackberry, ground pepper, bitter sage and a gamey note. Assertive tannins provide backup but leave an astringent finish."
Italy,90.0,23.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,"A rich and full-boded white blended from Sauvignon Blanc and Inzolia, the Nozze d'Oro begins with lightly buttery aromas of passionfruit, before developing melon and peach flavors in the mouth. Finishes long, with a refreshing note of bitter almond."
US,86.0,36.0,Chehalem Mountains,Colene Clemens,"Firm and lightly herbal, this has light strawberry-fruit flavors balanced against proportionate tannins and acids. There's nothing wrong here, it's just a light, almost innocuous wine."
France,87.0,15.0,Marcillac,Domaine Laurens,"Also known as the Mansois, the Fer Servadou has produced a bright and fruity wine from vineyards in the foothills of France's central mountains. It is soft, juicy and with fine acidity that cuts through its red fruits. Drink now."
Italy,95.0,75.0,Barolo,Germano Ettore,"New leather, red berry, tobacco and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find in this powerfully structured but elegant wine. The firm palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cinnamon flavors framed by noble, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2025??045."
US,87.0,29.0,Anderson Valley,Navarro,"The winemaker calls this a ?more masculine wine: richer, bigger,??which almost understates the case. It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango. It's all liberally enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. Almost too much of a good thing, but saved by brisk acidity."
Spain,90.0,34.0,Ribera del Duero,Matarromera,"Lactic blackberry and dark plum aromas suggest a full, ripe wine. That impression is confirmed via a meaty, chunky palate with flavors of blackberry, dried plum, pepper and mixed herbs. A dry, peppery tasting finish with mild residual heat closes this offering."
Spain,87.0,13.0,Rioja,Pingao,"Compact, rubbery aromas of plum and berry come with notes of cheesy oak and cowhide. A tight, fresh palate is balanced, tasting of plum, berry fruits and oaky spice. A straightforward finish echoes the palate."
US,91.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Eleven Eleven,"This luxurious wine revolves around a velvety texture of pure decadence and full-bodied pleasure. Earthy in clove and mushroom, the fruit dives deep into rich aspects of dark cherry and huckleberry."
US,91.0,60.0,Sonoma Coast,Signorello,"Hugely brawny in dark blackberry, plum and cinnamon, this wine packs a punch despite its coastal influence. Black pepper and smoke provide the savory aspect, while cranberry and strawberry the softer, prettier side of the story. Drink now through 2020."
US,86.0,12.0,California,Rose 'N' Blum,"This rides the Moscato craze with a wine that could be sweet enough to classify as a dessert sipper, but let's call it off-dry. It has jammy raspberry and apricot flavors, with a hint of orange zest. Best of all is the acidity, which is so clean and balancing."
US,87.0,19.0,Stags Leap District,Kirkland Signature,"Softly lush, a nice, fruit-forward Cabernet to drink now. Shows well-ripened blackberry and black currant flavors, finished with a touch of smoky oak. Good price for a Stags Leap Cab."
US,86.0,20.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Six Prong,"100% Cabernet Sauvignon all coming from Alder Ridge Vineyard, it has notes of cherry and dried herbs. The tannins are dry with a cranberry filled finish."
US,91.0,62.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Foxen,"From a vineyard in the heart of the appellation comes this bottling that's redolent with hibiscus, Earl Grey tea, orange rind, black cherry, spiced plum and fennel bulb on the nose. The palate plays a bit lighter, with brisk cranberry, more hibiscus and lots of cola, proving quite light and easy to sip though well structured as well."
US,90.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Chiarello Family Vineyards,"Pricey for a blush wine, but this is an excellent one, among the best rosÃ©s of the year. It's fairly dark in color and full-bodied, but very rich in strawberry and spice flavors, and the finish is smooth and dry."
US,84.0,40.0,Lake County,Langtry,"Made from Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is an herbal wine marked mostly by cassis and cranberry. The palate is thick with dense tannins and a dusty oak note."
US,86.0,18.0,Red Hills Lake County,Chacewater,"A brawny, dusty Petite with ripe flavors of plum and black fruit enveloped by sticky tannins."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Gavi,Michele Chiarlo,This luminous Gavi offers mineral notes of graphite and talc powder backed by fruity tones of peach and citrus. The wine is smooth and silky on the close and would pair with seafood or tuna salad.
Australia,89.0,50.0,Yarra Valley,Yeringberg,"This cherry-scented Pinot is straightforward, supple and easy to drink. Complexity comes from hints of cedar and menthol, while the finish is lined with fine, dusty tannins that elegantly linger."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Cafayate,Camino del Inca,"Dilute and watery on the bouquet, with a touch of lime and air freshener. Feels oily and chunky on the palate, with citrus and not too much else to ponder. Lemony and tangy on the finish, with pithy bitterness."
US,92.0,47.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Waits-Mast,"Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot. But it has much more going for it than that. The tannins are rich and complex, the finish is dry and spicy, and the overall impression is of wine with a great pedigree. Drink over the next six years."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Benessere,"Made from 100% Muscat di Canelli grapes, retaining 9.5% residual sugar, this is a perfumed dessert wine, reminiscent of GewÃ¼rztraminer in its lychee aromas. It remains balanced and light on the palate, not overly sweet."
US,93.0,46.0,Santa Maria Valley,El Lugar,"Fresh aromas of carnation, framboise, cherry cola and blooming rose petals show on the nose of this bottling by Coby Parker-Garcia. Bright flavors of hibiscus tea, pomegranate and raspberry ride a clean line of crushed thyme and peppercorn dust on the lively palate."
US,90.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,Schug,"Youthful, yet lush and voluptuous on the palate, this balanced wine shows a sublime layering of peach and tropical vanilla with hints of spicy nutmeg and fennel. The oak is subtle and supportive."
Italy,93.0,80.0,Barolo,Attilio Ghisolfi,"It opens with hallmark Nebbiolo scents of freshly picked roses, crushed violets, leather, berry, alpine herbs and forest floor. The delicious palate delivers a core of succulent black cherry accented with notes of cake spices, mint, licorice and grilled herbs. It's young but already balanced with powerful but refined tannins and brisk acidity. Drink 2020??045."
US,84.0,18.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Beckmen,"Simple and sharp in acidity, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors commingling in an uncomfortable coating of sweet oak. This RhÃ´ne-style blend from Beckmen is a disappointment."
US,87.0,15.0,California,Kendall-Jackson,"This has citrus, apricot and honey flavors brightened with crisp acidity. It turns a little sweet on the finish, but it's a lovely wine that should be versatile with a huge range of food."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Sicilia,Altadonna,"A bright expression of Nero d'Avola, this shows a pretty fruit note, backed by prune, spice and wet earth accents. It feels silky and supple, with soft tannins."
France,90.0,17.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Baracan,"The wine has fine, juicy fruit over smooth tannins. Its smoky flavors, touches of wood aging and rich tannic structure are integrating well. It will be ready to drink from 2020."
US,90.0,42.0,Anderson Valley,Breggo,"A fine young Pinot that shows the beauty of Anderson Valley as well as Breggo's deft approach. Dry and silky, it has cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and peppery spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Good now with decanting, and through 2011."
US,88.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Franciscan,"Smooth and oaky, this value-minded wine offers varietal notes of cassis and cranberry, with traces of dried herb, cedar and pencil lead. A heftier midpalate strengthens in the glass before a long, clove-infused finish."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Calatayud,Cruz de Piedra,"Earthy blackberry flavors include carob and herbal accents. This is drawing and high in acidity, while earthy, herbal flavors of raspberry and plum are a bit green. Charred oak, clove and leafy berry flavors take over on the finish."
US,85.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Liberty Lake,"The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of wet copper penny, herbs, tobacco and spice. The red-fruit flavors are subdued, with an elegant styling."
Argentina,92.0,45.0,Mendoza,Zuccardi,"Powerful, pure and tightly wound, meaning it's a candidate for short-term cellaring, say 2?? years. Smells ripe and fruity, with blackberry, cola and coconut resulting in a spot-on nose. Concentrated and juicy, with a strong constitution and potent plum, berry and cassis flavors. Toasty and lightly oaky on the finish; 73% Malbec and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon."
Italy,89.0,23.0,Collio,Marco Felluga,"Aromas of pear, pressed white flower, exotic fruit and hints of toasted oak lead the nose. The round palate offers nectarine zest, apricot, dried herb and vanilla alongside soft but refreshing acidity."
US,90.0,45.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chateau Lettau,"Damp sagebrush, dark cranberry, buttered black cherries, fresh plucked marjoram and wet stone show on the nose of this bottling. The tip of the sip shows great thyme, bay leaf and anise character, then settles into rich cranberry fruit, all held together by a decent tannic grip. The dark fruit flavors linger deep in the finish."
US,87.0,29.0,Amador County,Brooklyn West,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are accented by a spicy, earthy quality in this easy-drinking, well-balanced wine, and the flavors gush with fruit. It's smooth and polished on the palate, medium in body and light in tannin."
US,86.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Zerba Cellars,"An interesting blend that incorporates 12% SÃ©millon with the Viognier. The Bordeaux grape adds weight and smoothes out the Viognier, which tends to be hot and sharp. What you end up with is a slightly buttery white blend that could go well with a variety of spicy dishes."
France,86.0,14.0,Beaujolais,Louis Jadot,"Light, fruity and juicy, this is a soft cherry-flavored wine. It has attractive acidity that lifts the warm fruitiness and gives the wine its characteristic perfumed aftertaste. Drink now."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Chianti Classico,Querciavalle,"This earthy Tuscan offers aromas that recall underbrush, berries, violet and spice. The juicy palate delivers ripened dark cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon-spice alongside chewy tannins and fresh acidity."
France,85.0,17.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau ArmandiÃ¨re,"The 12 months of wood aging has left its mark on this wine, giving it a spicy burnt character. That makes it tough and unlikely to broaden out. It will likely remain dry and firm."
US,85.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Left Coast Cellars,"There is a somewhat disjointed aspect to the mouthfeel of this wine, and some light and unusual floral scents that don't follow through as flavors. Clean, simple fruit and light cracker flavors come and go rather quickly. Two bottles tasted."
France,90.0,20.0,JuliÃ©nas,Trenel Fils,"Full of firm tannins, this JuliÃ©nas shows solid structure and ripe red fruits. The fine acidity should help the wine age, and the juicy, fruity character should appear after a year or more."
US,87.0,15.0,Lake County,Shooting Star,"This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food. It smells lightly spicy, tastes like raspberries and red cherries and has light tannins that add some needed grip."
US,88.0,29.0,Chehalem Mountains,Chehalem,"Just a touch of residual sugar (11 g/L) softens up the edges of this wine, which brings flavors of tart lemon, grapefruit pith and wet paper into play. Try it with prawns, shellfish or non-spicy noodle dishes."
US,93.0,75.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"Crushed slate, plush rose petals, red cherry, smoked beef, vanilla and a slightly feral quality arise on the nose of this bottling from the region's most iconic vineyard. There is great tension on the sip, with tart plum skin, bright raspberry and dark cranberry fruit meeting with black spice, sandalwood and incense flavors. Acidity binds it all together."
US,88.0,13.0,Ancient Lakes,Jones of Washington,"The light and mineral aromas belie the palate's full, rounded fruit flavors with some sugar sweetening the finish."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Chianti Classico,Dievole,"There's a very attractive fullness and roundness to this wine that wins over your senses the moment you lift the glass to your nose. The wine delivers aromas of black cherry, Asian spice, root beer, vanilla and sweet maple syrup that are distinct and pristine. It's modern and velvety in the mouth with tight structure and great length."
Italy,90.0,18.0,Chianti Classico,Rocca delle MacÃ¬e,"Here is a popular winery that just keeps on producing attractive, well-priced wines. This Riserva 1998 manages to combine soft, quaffable fruit with generous, almost opulent richness. There's something brooding about the firm tannins and tarry flavors, but the fruit is just deliciously ripe."
France,88.0,18.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Ducros,"The wine is ripe and smooth, with rich if still dry tannins. Its juicy black fruit and acidity are balanced with a structure that will allow it to age further. Drink from 2019."
Argentina,85.0,17.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Lagarde,"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors."
Italy,95.0,100.0,Barolo,Eugenio Bocchino,"From a simpatico, family-run winery comes this benchmark Barolo. La Serra speaks highly of the Langhe territory and of winemaking innovation. Aromas here include cherry cola, vanilla bean, leather and crushed granite stone. The wine is determined and direct with a savory note of cured meat on the long finish. Drink after 2017."
Argentina,81.0,11.0,Mendoza,Budini,"Two vintages ago this wine rated the same, so we can say that improvement and evolution are not evident. This wine is tan in color and heavy, with strange butterscotch aromas that seem foreign and artificial. Forced oak flavors and a resiny mouthfeel are also drawbacks."
US,91.0,39.0,Red Mountain,Efeste,"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Syrah is unabashedly funky. If you like a wine with generous aromas of barnyard and garden, along with potent, ripe, berry-laden fruit, this delivers in spades. Barrel aging adds chocolate and dark espresso character to the finish."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux,Cheval Quancard,"Smoky and structured, this is a wine that has both firm tannins and balanced, juicy fruits. It's a fine wine to drink now, especially with rich meats, and it can age for a year or two."
Australia,93.0,40.0,Margaret River,Vasse Felix,"Winemaker Virginia Willcock's latest effort shows that top-flight Margaret River Chardonnay doesn't have to cost three figures. This is fine stuff, a bit funky at first, but opening up in the glass to reveal hints of brown-sugar-glazed pineapple and fresh citrus. It's medium to full in body, with a long, almost painfully crisp finish that brings all that fruit into bright, refreshing focus."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,Monte del FrÃ¡,"Made using grapes from the Fumane subzone of Valpolicella, this shows simple lines that are nonetheless balanced and clean. Berry and spice aromas add heft to the medium weight and persistency of the mouthfeel."
US,93.0,30.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bargetto,"Ripe apples and pears meet with daffodils, honeysuckle and dried peaches on the nose of this wine from the Corralitos area. Flavors of lemon-lime soda, chamomile tea and pressed white flowers show on the floral and uplifting palate, which is warmed by a touch of popcorn."
US,90.0,35.0,St. Helena,Trinchero,"Nice and dry, with firm, hard tannins and rich flavors of blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate. The oak is pretty strong, offering a coating of caramel. Shows a full-bodied, masculine Cabernet character that needs a good decant to aerate the tannins. Should age though 2013, at least."
US,86.0,21.0,Mt. Harlan,Calera,"This wine is a little short and abupt on the finish. It's very similar to a minor Chardonnay, with buttercream, vanilla and tropical and citrus fruits. The acidity is quite brisk, like a squirt of lime."
France,89.0,80.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Troplong Mondot,"Wood dominates this wine, the wine itself relatively light, but finely composed. There are spicy tannins with intense acidity, crisp black currants, bursting through the overlay of wood."
France,89.0,18.0,Brouilly,Domaines Dominique Piron,"Round and soft, very much in the style of warm-hearted Brouilly. The wine has a layer of tannins, while it's the delicious red berry fruits that dominate. Ripe, full and ready to drink."
France,89.0,80.0,Chambolle-Musigny,Manuel Olivier,"Exhibiting the natural richness of a Chambolle wine, this is a work in progress. Tannins are still integrating with the generous red fruits and acidity to give the ripe and rounded wine it will become. Drink from 2017."
US,99.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Williams Selyem,"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years."
US,83.0,45.0,Napa Valley,Grizzly Republic,"Simple, soft and sweetly fruity, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, chocolate and black pepper. Seems pricey for what you get."
Spain,85.0,14.0,Rioja,Bodegas Riolanc,"Grainy and leathery smelling, with medicinal plum and raspberry aromas. Perky but angular in the mouth, with freshening acidity leading to light but zesty strawberry and raspberry flavors. Shows drying tannins, vanilla and spice on the back end."
US,86.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),North by Northwest,"The initial impression of young, juicy red berries carries into an astringent wine with streaks of gravel and chalk. It's pleasant, simple but quick to fade."
France,91.0,55.0,Champagne,A. Margaine,"This is a seriously dry wine. Arnaud Margaine works each harvest to create freshness and a totally crisp texture, generally dismissing malolactic fermentation. It is balanced, allowing the fruitiness to shine through the tight, mineral texture from the predominant Chardonnay in the blend that comes from a mere 16-acre Montaigne de Reims vineyard surrounded by Pinot Noir. It could age through 2015 in bottle to be even better."
US,92.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Parallel,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now."
US,87.0,15.0,North Coast,Steelhead Vineyards,"This hearty, sturdy and flavorful red tastes dry, with firm tannins and good acidity. The aromas are a bit like wood smoke but not in an over-oaked way, and the flavors are like pomegranate and cranberry juice."
Italy,89.0,70.0,Barolo,Vite Colte,"Forest floor, woodland berry and spice aromas emerge in the glass. The tight palate offers sour cherry, white pepper, grilled herb and a whiff of tobacco alongside close-grained tannins and racy acidity. An anisette note closes the finish."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Sicilia,Feudo Montoni,"Feudo Montoni delivers a delightful expression of Catarratto (one of Sicily's most popular white varieties) with an intense bouquet that is redolent of cut grass, citrus, grapefruit, almond skin and white flower. Very nice and easy-drinking with medium density and good freshness."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Ridolfi,"Juicy and round, youthful red delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and clove aromas and flavors. Chewy tannins provide structure. Enjoy through 2020."
US,88.0,15.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"The aromas are light with notes of herb, citrus and tropical fruit. The palate is a bit more generous, showing pleasing herb and tropical fruit notes accented by tart acidity."
US,88.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sleight of Hand,"Despite its 2.4% residual sugar, this is a tart, lemony wine that seems made to enjoy with raw oysters. The searing acidity is not for everyone, but if you like lip-smacking tartness, this has the depth and flavor to match it."
US,86.0,27.0,North Fork of Long Island,Martha Clara,"While the nose suggests intensely ripe, almost ruddy black plums and cherries, the palate of this full-bodied blend is surprisingly lean. Black fruit flavors, accented by swathes of sage and thyme, are surprisingly crisp and tart. It's a delicately concentrated wine finishing on a meandering fade of soft tannins."
US,90.0,32.0,Napa Valley,JR Wine,"This interesting blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Charbono and Cabernet Franc is a big wine packed with powerful black currant and licorice flavors, with a liberal dusting of pepper. It impresses for dryness and the rich, sturdy tannins. Drink this rustically chic wine with roasts."
Italy,85.0,10.0,Soave Classico,Balestri Valda,"There's a surprising amount of structure here that is rarely seen in Italian whites, especially Soave Classico. The wine also delivers ripe aromas of peach, melon and pineapple."
Italy,86.0,29.0,Offida Pecorino,Le Caniette,"Aged for one year in barriques, this is dominated by raw oak and butterscotch aromas that carry over to the palate alongside lemon and pineapple flavors. While it's an understandable effort to differentiate it from other wines made from Pecorino, it doesn't possess enough fruit richness to support the wood sensations."
US,90.0,70.0,Chehalem Mountains,Anam Cara,"Aged in 100% once-filled barrels, this is a selection from barrels set aside for the reserve programs. Without the influence of new oak, a streak of citrus comes into play, giving this apple and berry-flavored wine a crisp tart edge."
Argentina,93.0,60.0,Mendoza,Durigutti,"With an opaque color and huge aromas of graphite, blackberry, cassis and creamy oak, this epitomizes modern Argentinean wine. The palate on this Malbec-and-Cabernet-Franc-driven blend is weighty, relaxed and deep. Flavors of baked blackberry, cassis and plum come with herb, chocolate and spice accents. Look for additional oak and chocolate on the chewy but smooth finish. Drink through 2018."
France,84.0,12.0,CÃ´tes du Lot,ChÃ¢teau Famaey,"Made from Malbec, this lightly structured wine tastes rich while also fruity. Caramel flavors go over the red berry fruits and give a rounded, still fresh aftertaste."
France,90.0,25.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau Haut-Monplaisir,"Full of new wood and tannic flavors, this is dense, dry, very firm. It does suffer from some licorice overextraction that gives the wine a bitter edge. At the same time, the wine has a full and firm character that promises a softening over the next several years."
US,94.0,90.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"Intensely fruity on the nose, with spicy flavors that follow and expand across the palate. This has excellent grip and depth, along with balancing acidity and structure. Plum, kirsch and concentrated cherry flavors pop out. It's a wine of refined power."
US,88.0,26.0,Anderson Valley,Balo,"Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party."
France,90.0,12.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Sorin,"Rich, full tasting wine from the Sorin family, with smoothly ripe red berry fruits. There's an attractive orange zest character that gives piquancy to this great food rosÃ©."
US,92.0,52.0,Paso Robles,Treana,"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now."
US,87.0,24.0,Sonoma County,Stave 28,"A very good interpretation of Sangiovese. A pretty sharp mouthfeel, but maybe that's to be expected from this high-acid variety. Otherwise, it's nice and dry, with complex cherry, red currant, licorice, leather and sandalwood flavors. Good with spicy beef, pork and veal dishes."
US,88.0,56.0,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Foxen 7200,"Deep blueberry, wet slate, chocolate and touches of herbs and olive show on the very reserved nose of this bottling, which still needs some time to evolve in the bottle. The acidity is bright, almost searing. and the tannins are nicely sticky, showing zesty flavors of pressed blackberry fruit."
US,92.0,25.0,Santa Barbara County,Rancho Sisquoc,"A complete package, this shows lavender, smoke, boysenberry and black raspberry aromas on the nose. Plenty of acidity appears on the palate, where black pepper, white pepper, thyme and bay leaf spice up the tight blackberry core, finishing on a slightly caramelized note."
Italy,95.0,60.0,Montefalco Sagrantino,Cantina Fratelli Pardi,"Blue flower, moist soil, leather, game, ripe dark berry and graphite are just some of the aromas of this powerfully structured, delicious wine. The palate delivers layers of juicy black cherry, blackberry, raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside youthfully assertive but ripe tannins. Drink 2017??030."
US,85.0,14.0,Lodi,Lapis Luna,"As sweet as raspberry tea sweetened with a couple spoons of white sugar. Alcohol provides a pleasant burn. If this sweeter style of Zin is your thing, it's quite a nice wine."
US,87.0,19.0,Mendocino County,Enotria,"Quite a lot of fruit flavor is packed into this straightforward, dry and non-oaky wine. It should be versatile at the dinner table because of its direct flavors, rather reserved texture and good balance."
Italy,87.0,56.0,Barolo,Cascina Adelaide,"Slightly disjointed at first, this Barolo with fruit sourced from four vineyard sites, needs a few minutes to open in the glass. The wine offers tertiary aromas of cured beef, smoked bacon and white mushroom. Drink now."
France,90.0,25.0,Corse,Clos Venturi,"More deeply colored than the current fashion for pale rosÃ©s, this wine also has plenty of flavor. It offers juicy red-berry fruits, orange juice, and a crisp, direct texture. It is meant to go with food."
US,87.0,36.0,New Jersey,Unionville,"Flavors of raspberry jam, pain grille, spice box and dark cherry are forward and succulent, thanks to the juicy acidity and flexible tannins. An herbal rose note surfaces on the midpalate, leading to a warm, persistent finish. Enjoy this with grilled salmon with a soy-ginger glaze."
US,92.0,37.0,Santa Maria Valley,Foxen,"With mouthwatering acidity, a stony minerality, modest alcohol and complex peach, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, this Chardonnay shows a Burgundian approach despite its California origins. Bone dry, it has a precise, chiseled elegance."
France,88.0,18.0,Chiroubles,Vignerons de Bel Air,"Chiroubles is highest of the Beaujolais cru villages, producing wines with good structure. This wine, with its firm tannins, shows some aging potential. It has acidity and ripe red-plum flavors over a dry core. Drink from 2017."
US,88.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,MacRostie,"This fine wine is made in larger quantities than many of the producer's other offerings, affording a chance to be introduced to a lovely white characteristic of the vintage and region in its friendly waves of pineapple, lemon and Gravenstein apple. Chalky on the palate at first, it provides a medium body and length with a back note of herb and anise."
Italy,94.0,64.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fornacina,"This Brunello offers bright aromas with lively cherry, cola, humus, dark spice and pipe tobacco, as well as savory tones of beef bresaola and even a touch of white peppercorn. Impressive complexity. Elegant and streamlined on the close."
US,90.0,17.0,Sonoma County,Trellis,"This delightful drink is just what you want a nice Merlot to be. Fruity and rich, with a nice balance between the blackberry flavors and deeper ones of earth and sage, it's marked by soft, dry tannins and a dollop of smoky oak."
US,87.0,40.0,Chehalem Mountains,Arbor Brook,"Soft scents of lavender introduce this pale rose-colored Pinot Noir. It's a light, elegant wine with clean, tart flavors of rhubarb and sour cherry that don't reflect the stated alcohol of 13.9% abv."
France,87.0,20.0,Minervois,ChÃ¢teau la Grave,"This Syrah-Grenache rosÃ© is intensely herbal, with strong notes of thyme, sage, parsley, laurel and lavender, all grounded by a tart cherry character. The palate is pleasantly zippy in acidity and a touch astringent through the close, with notes of orange pith and melon rind that linger nicely. Drink now."
Argentina,84.0,11.0,San Juan,Casa Montes,"Briny, cidery aromas are a touch stale. This has a basic citrusy mouthfeel along with flavors of orange and tangerine that turn mildly bitter and pithy on the finish."
Italy,89.0,24.0,Sicilia,Feudo Maccari,"Aromas recall ripe berry, violet, leather, oak and spice. The firm palate offers mature blackberry, dried cherry, espresso, roasted coffee bean, licorice and toasted oak. Assertive tannins leave an astringent, mouth-puckering finish. Drink after 2017."
US,92.0,38.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Gainey,"From the Gainey family's Sta. Rita Hills ranch, this begins with aromas of buttered popcorn, vanilla, pineapple and crushed rocks. Once sipped, golden apple flavors integrate superbly with a lime pith tartness and a slight brioche character on the midpalate and finish."
US,86.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Thomas Fogarty,"A little hot and tannic, with a young Port feeling, except that the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry. Hard to tell where it's going. Grown in Yountville."
US,96.0,75.0,Santa Maria Valley,Au Bon Climat,"A stunning Pinot Noir. Feels soft as silk, yet crisp, tastes flamboyant yet controlled, a wine that contains many opposites. Made from a barrel selection of the best of winemaker Clendenen's Bien Nacido Pinots, it's superb to drink now. Hard to exaggerate its charms, with waves of spicy raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood. Really seductive and impressive."
US,88.0,40.0,Santa Clara Valley,Sarah's Vineyard,"An herbal-leaning bottling, this shows oregano, pasilla chile and a shred of bell pepper on the nose, giving nuance to the blueberry-fruit base. It's fresh and easy-drinking on the peppery palate, with strawberry cut by more chile elements. It's great for those who enjoy pyrazine influence, but stay away if not."
US,89.0,62.0,Stags Leap District,Robinson Family Vineyards,"A soft, creamy texture houses buttery flavors of blackberry jam and mocha in this Cab, which has a drop of Merlot. It's flashy and opulent, in the modern Napa style, with relatively high alcohol that gives a bite of heat. Drink it over the next six years."
France,87.0,28.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Domaine CÃ©drick Bardin,"Ripe, soft and full bodied, this wine has fresh citrus and gooseberry flavors along with zesty lemon and a bright aftertaste. It needs a few more months to fill out, so drink from 2017."
Italy,84.0,10.0,Campania,Pierluigi Zampaglione,"This has intense aromas of spearmint and eucalyptus. The palate is lean, with licorice and mineral but not enough fruit."
US,87.0,35.0,Sonoma County,Valley of the Moon,"It's a big wine, full-bodied, tannic and rustic, but rich in blackberry and cherry jam, mu shu plum sauce and sandalwood flavors, with a bacony umami note. Try with pasta in tomato sauce with sausage."
US,91.0,32.0,Carneros,Beaulieu Vineyard,"Strawberry tea and rose-petal aromas open this wine with nuance and elegance, a nice entry to a velvety texture that's both spicy and sublime. Forest floor and clove contribute complexity as a touch of smoky oak rises on the finish."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Ribera del Duero,Viridiana,"Tarry, rubbery aromas of blackened berry fruits lead to a full, wide palate, with ripe blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. This is full of oak spice on a long, satisfying finish."
France,82.0,15.0,Bordeaux Blanc,Producta Vignobles,"Light and fruity, the wine is dilute and gently textured. It is ready to drink."
US,88.0,36.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Ibarra,"Though a tad funky at first, this wine's nose leans toward tropical but not heavily so. Aromas convey cut lemongrass, lime candy, pineapple guava skins and a lean stone character. It's also grassy on the palate, with tight lemon juice acidity and a nectarine finish."
Italy,87.0,38.0,Barbaresco,Gian Piero Marrone,"This wine's menthol, crushed herb, red berry and violet aromas emerge in the glass. The palate evokes raw red cherry, pomegranate and white pepper and is structured by firm acidity and bracing tannins, feeling tight and austere."
France,90.0,17.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Lucien Albrecht,"Tart red currant, rhubarb and strawberry come together in a very refreshing, rounded and appetizing fashion. The frothy, foaming mousse is exuberant and highlights these strawberry shortcake flavors brilliantly, while a totally dry palate makes sure that this stays classy. This is very satisfying, fun and fruit-driven, with a serious core and a bright, lemony finish."
US,85.0,27.0,Virginia,Barrel Oak,"Rich and full bodied, this abounds with pretty flower, sweet peach and pear aromas mingled with a toasted oak. It's decidedly oaky on the palate, with an abundance of smoke, vanilla and coconut notes. Generous in body, this has nicely extracted apple and lemon flavors. Drink now."
Spain,83.0,12.0,Navarra,Otazu,"The nose is funky and sweaty, with a hint of citrus and red-berry aromas. The palate is heavy and cloying, while generic flavors taste sticky, reedy and suggest no particular fruits. A light bitterness marks the finish."
Spain,84.0,11.0,Rueda,Pagos del Rey,"Briny, minerally aromas of vitamin dust and lees feed into a yeasty, round, melony palate. Flavors of yellow apple, mango and mustard finish yeasty, soft and briny."
US,90.0,36.0,Amador County,Fiddletown Cellars,"Drinking this tasty, grapy wine is like raiding a wild blackberry patch in July. It has fresh, bright berry aromas and flavors, medium body, good acidity and a clean finish. Made from one half Zinfandel and one half Petite Sirah, it seems to keep improving and gaining more depth with each sip."
France,86.0,37.0,CÃ´tes du Jura,Domaine Pignier,"Light and bright, this attractive, fruity wine has raspberry and red plum flavors along with a tannic core. It could age, although it's good to drink now."
US,85.0,20.0,Central Coast,Inception,"Iron, raspberry and light cranberry notes greet the nose on this bottling. That sanguine element powers the palate as well, where iron and rust meet with turned earth flavors."
US,90.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Peterson,"This is a big, strong, exuberant Zindandel that shows Dry Creek's briary, brambly personality at its best. It's a dry, full-bodied, tannic wine, with flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Black pepper, star anise and cinnamon provide the exotic spices. It's quite a good, rich Zinfandel at a very good price."
France,89.0,20.0,Chiroubles,Trenel Fils,"This has a mineral structure that's laced with acidity and red currant flavor. It has a tight texture and a crisp feel, showing a serious, austere side of Beaujolais. It's all balanced by the bright, crisp finish."
US,92.0,145.0,Napa Valley,Louis M. Martini,"This ranks among the producer's biggest, boldest and most luxurious wines, a celebration of all that the appellation can offer in a stellar vintage. Integrated tannins provide structure without distraction, while layers of red berry, currant and leather combine for a dry, ripe and rewarding mouthfeel. This should be best between 2023 and 2025."
France,87.0,10.0,Vin de France,Famille Perrin,"Made from certified organic grapes, this is a medium-bodied blend of Syrah, Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre and Merlot. Bay leaf and black olive aromas add earthy notes on the palate, giving this ripe, chocolaty wine an anchor in the south of France. Drink now."
US,93.0,100.0,Sonoma Valley,Gundlach Bundschu,"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant mixture with 11% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, this powerfully generous wine has a thread of classic black olive and dried herb that provides a restrained edge. Tightly woven tannin and oak give added strength and structure."
Italy,87.0,26.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Panizzi,"Subtle aromas suggesting toasted oak, acacia and grapefruit take shape in the glass. On the racy palate, yellow apple, bitter almond and a hint of lemon zest are set against vibrant acidity."
US,89.0,25.0,Livermore Valley,Occasio,"Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance."
US,86.0,17.0,Willamette Valley,Hanson Vineyards,"This is a simple, rather generic white wine. The fruit is clean with an impression of light spice around flavors of apple and pear. It's a useful, all-purpose, fruity quaffer."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Rioja,Finca Valpiedra,"Chunky, roasted, somewhat stalky aromas are big and generous but lack purity. This feels snappy and tannic, while flavors of tomato, herbs and oak end with loamy, baked flavors. This is good stuff but it leans toward tomato sauce in flavor and feel."
France,89.0,16.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Grand Moulin,"This ripe, smoky wine is full of black fruits and soft, generous tannins. It is rich, juicy with black plum juice and berry jelly flavors that are still young and fresh. Age this wine until 2017."
US,86.0,22.0,El Dorado,Holly's Hill,"Aromas of grapefruit and honeysuckle get the attention right away. Flavors of peach and honey, a soft and smooth texture, good acidity, full body and a touch of sweetness finish the picture. This certainly gives maximum fruitiness."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Terre del Volturno,Terre del Principe,"Here's a unique blend of two of Campania's little known grapes, Casavecchia and Pallagrello Nero. It opens with a pretty fragrance of blue flower, ripe berries and spice. The soft, round palate offers red berry and fleshy blackberry accented by cinnamon-toast notes. Drink soon."
US,88.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Pomar Junction,"Imagine sniffing barely ripe peach and guava through their skins to understand the brisk and subtle nose of this wine. The flavors are also subtle, but quite refreshing, with squeezed citrus and poached apple shining brightest."
Italy,90.0,60.0,Barolo,Pio Cesare,"Aromas of oak extract, toast, red berry and espresso wrap around this structured wine. The firm palate offers up sour cherry, ground pepper and licorice alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018??028."
Argentina,87.0,19.0,Valle de Uco,Salentein,"Oily citrus aromas are pungent on the nose. This is chunky but braced by firm acidity. Waxy, warm, oaky flavors of caramel and baked apple finish with punchy citric acidity and an oak-based touch of butterscotch."
France,83.0,18.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Saint Martin,"Lightly spicy, this soft wine has a zesty tang of orange and bright strawberries that are ripe and gently fruity. The wine is open, ready to drink."
France,93.0,29.0,Alsace,Domaine Pfister,"The nose is a mere promise compared to the full-on experience that follows. The dry palate is a lovely synthesis of ripe, textured and tart elements: of russet-pear peel and flesh, of grapefruit zestiness and spice, of ripe and aromatic tangerine. This is concentrated and full of flavor, animated and full of impact. This seems like energizing fuel. Mouthwatering freshness creates a long fruit-rich driven finish."
Spain,87.0,14.0,Rioja,Covila,"Standard red-berry, rubber and spice aromas are straightforward. This is active on the palate, with pinching tannins, snappy acidity and rawness. Tomato, dry oak, currant, red plum and dusty spice flavors finish with firm tannins and moderate heat and burn."
Australia,86.0,18.0,McLaren Vale,Twelve Staves,"Aptly named, for the oak influence here is strong?a dusty woodiness that's almost cedary. Fortunately, it's well integrated with the full-bodied cherry fruit. Finishes dry, but soft and ripe. ?J.C."
France,90.0,24.0,Cahors,Georges Vigouroux,"From one of the highest vineyards in Cahors, this mineral, textured wine brings out the firmest tannins at this young stage. It is complex, powerful, full of structured, very dry. Underneath, there is a great weight of black fruit waiting to come out. Drink from 2016."
Spain,89.0,62.0,Bierzo,RaÃºl PÃ©rez,"This opens with barrel-based aromas of resin and spice. It's round, creamy and Burgundian on the palate, with flavors of spiced apple, walnut and a hint of oxidation. Things flatten on the finish, which tastes yeasty and like toffee."
Italy,89.0,40.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Volpe Pasini,"Aromas recall white spring flowers and mature pears. The linear palate offers tart Granny Smith, lemon custard and Bartlett pear alongside fresh acidity. It has balance and a clean finish."
France,91.0,33.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"An intriguing nose combines dried and baked apple with a far more floral notes. The dry palate accentuates the apple at one moment and sprays of honeysuckle and jasmine on the next. This is fragrant, dry and summery, concentrated and totally refreshing. A wine for special moments of joy."
France,88.0,60.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"Dry and crisp, this bright, tight Champagne has citrus, red fruits and a strong steely character at its heart. The bottling tastes young, fresh and would benefit from some bottle age. Hold it until mid-2015."
US,86.0,17.0,Russian River Valley,Martin Ray,"Notes of pineapple candy, buttered popcorn, honey and vanilla flavors. Brisk acidity adds an important balance."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Alto Adige,Tramin,"Exceedingly fresh and fragrant, this has medium structure, with bright stone fruit and citrus aromas. It should pair with smoked salmon or tuna tartare."
US,89.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pomum,Herb and barrel spice aromas lead to plump cherry and cranberry flavors. The tannins bring some grip.
Italy,87.0,20.0,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,Zonin,"This offers ripe plum and red-berry aromas, accented with a touch of bitter almond. It has a clean and refined palate, showing black cherry and white pepper flavors. Fresh and spicy, try this with pasta all'arrabbiata."
France,90.0,60.0,Champagne,H. Blin,"In the dry style of Blin Champagnes, this is a fruity and very crisp wine. Sliced apples and crisp pears are cut with pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. It is fresh with acidity that balances the fruit. The texture at the end is soft, lightly mineral."
US,91.0,54.0,Napa Valley,Virage,"Made in what the producer calls a Right-Bank Tradition, this red wine combines 69% Cabernet Franc with 27% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon to classy, restrained effect. Perfumed in cedar and pencil shavings, it has fine, integrated tannins and an elegance to the lengthy, cassis-kissed finish."
Italy,90.0,75.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Tommasi,"This classic Amarone has a fragrance of blackberry and spice. The palate delivers succulent but restrained black cherry flavor, with accents of white pepper, nutmeg and almond. It's structured, but also has just enough freshness."
US,86.0,75.0,Stags Leap District,Rock Wall,"This high-end wine has a tenacious hold of earthiness, that exhibits as tomato leaf and dried herb. Full-bodied and densely concentrated, its tannins are smooth and fine, while the texture leans gravelly. Black pepper and leather characteristics are hard to ignore."
US,89.0,50.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Brander,"Ripe fruit combines with fine tannins to make for a Cabernet that's easy to drink, yet good enough for an expensive cut of steak. The black cherry and raspberry flavors have a brambly edge, almost like a Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. Don't look for Napa smoothness and opulence; instead, let the rustic nature of this wine charm you."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Etna,Benanti,"Made entirely from the native grape Nerello Cappuccio grown on Mount Etna, this polished wine opens with aromas of ripe red berries, underbrush, violet and leather. The delicious palate delivers succulent wild cherry, ripe raspberry, carob, cocoa and orange peel alongside silky, smooth tannins."
US,90.0,18.0,Finger Lakes,Silver Thread,"Tropical mango and melon mingle elegantly into swathes of blossom and peach in this lush, juicy GewÃ¼rztraminer. It's lusciously textured, a bit brawny even, boasting creamy swirls of fruit that linger long and heavy through the finish. Drink now through 2016."
US,87.0,13.0,Amador County,Sobon Estate,"A crowd-pleasing Barbera full of muted dark fruit, leathery aromas accented by cherry cola and blue and blackberry flavors that's soft and drinkable and packed with acidity."
US,91.0,46.0,Wahluke Slope,Fielding Hills,"The aromas bring notes of baking spice, vanilla, cassis, coconut and dark fruit, along with a penetrating anise note. The black-fruit flavors are rich and luscious, displaying a sense of hedonism that shows equal parts fruit and barrel."
Italy,91.0,135.0,Orcia,Podere Forte,"From the Orcia area of Tuscany, here's a blockbuster 70-30 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot with deep concentration and thick density. Evident woodshop or carpentry tones come into play, leaving long-lasting flavaors of vanilla bean, chocolate and coffee. The wine has tart, plump tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging before they settle into place. Drink after 2015."
France,86.0,56.0,Meursault,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils,"This has herb and wood aromas, leading to a palate that's structured, with a yeasty, toasty flavor and a green, herbal character. It is quite tight, and does need to age for at least two years."
France,92.0,20.0,Chinon,ChÃ¢teau du Coudray Montpensier,"The latest vintage from this estate is still very young. It has typical stalky black fruits, layers of wood aging that give spice and dark toast and following acidity. As it balances, the stalkiness will subside to give a richly structured wine. Drink from 2019."
US,88.0,35.0,Rutherford,Davis Estates,"This is a bright, medium-bodied wine with a thickness of creamy vanilla that makes it seem slightly sweet, built atop crisper shocks of lime zest and orange peel. Ultimately it finishes smooth and velvety, a nice match for the table."
US,86.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Boedecker Cellars,"This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level."
US,87.0,25.0,Napa-Carneros,Bouchaine,"A very nice, super-drinkable Chardonnay marked by brisk, cool-climate acidity and a bracing minerality. The pineapple, peach and apple flavors have the slight herbality you often find in Napa Chardonnay."
France,83.0,14.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau du RouÃ«t,"Light in color and flavor, this is a ghost of a wine, with pale fruitiness and acidity, with a fleeting texture."
US,88.0,30.0,Carneros,Truchard,"Dry, oaky and minerally, this Chardonnay shows intensely focused Meyer lemon, lime, Asian pear and golden apricot flavors, whose acidity makes it savory. One-third new oak gives it a vanilla and buttered toast richness. Drink this fine wine now, but not too cold."
France,87.0,22.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau Barreyre,"This fruity wine is full of cherry and blackberry flavors. It has a soft texture, lightly spiced and with an attractive balance of acidity and firmer tannins. Drink from 2018."
US,91.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Quivira,"From organically-grown and certified Biodemeter-grown grapes, this rosÃ© blends 70% Grenache with 15% each of MourvÃ¨dre and Syrah to produce a dry, robust wine aromatic in peach skin and tangerine. Orange blossom and candied orange peel on the palate add to the freshness and lively acidity."
US,92.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Armanino Family Cellars,"Jean Hoefliger is the consulting winemaker for this wine, an earthy 100% expression of the variety that's rich and lush yet fully balanced in acidity. Dark truffle, forest floor and Bing cherry characterize the aromas and flavors, around a tightly wound core of intense fruit that explodes on the palate on the finish."
Italy,91.0,33.0,Valtellina Superiore,Rainoldi,"Aromas of crushed violet, dried rose petal, underbrush, ripe berry and a balsamic note lead the nose on this classically crafted Nebbiolo. The firm palate delivers dried black cherries, raspberries, licorice, clove, mint and tobacco alongside assertive but polished tannins and bright acidity. It's still young so let this fully develop. Drink 2019??029."
Argentina,87.0,19.0,Mendoza,Rutini,"Minty, inky, oaky aromas rest on top of basic berry scents. This is juicy but also reduced in feel. The flavor profile is superficial, with hints of cassis and blackberry. The finish is loamy and heavy, with adequate lift and acidity."
Spain,87.0,15.0,PenedÃ¨s,Torres,"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy. If you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors, this is your ticket. It's a controlled wine that meets expectations. With 15% Parellada."
US,92.0,39.0,Red Hills Lake County,Sol Rouge,Intensely ripe and concentrated fruit flavors dominate both the aromas and flavors of this very full-bodied but ultrasmooth wine. Light notes of dried sage and cinnamon dust the blackberry jam and candied-strawberry flavors for a nuanced complexity despite the high alcohol and supreme ripeness.
US,89.0,27.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lafond,"Fresh and clean aromas of raspberry and a wild array of red fruit flavors characterize this wine from regional pioneer Pierre Lafond and winemaker Bruce McGuire. A minerally, slate-driven palate that's steel-like in its sharpness contributes backbone. This wine will age well."
France,87.0,13.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Compagnie Viticole de Provence,"Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah form a soft warm blend that is ready to drink. It has acidity and spice as well as red berries. It's a fine apÃ©ritif style with its light touch and final crispness. Drink now."
Spain,89.0,18.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,ViÃ±as del Cenit,"A dark, roasted, smoky opening is the greeting on this burly Tempranillo from Zamora. Grabbing tannins pinch like squeaky rubbery, while this tastes of savory, roasted black fruits. A meaty, chewy, tannic finish is confirmation of overall toughness. Drink through 2021."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Offida Passerina,Centanni Giacomo,"This opens with bright aromas of citrus and apple. The palate offers lemon and pear flavors, with a hint of vanilla. Pair this racy wine with light first courses and delicately seasoned fish dishes."
Spain,84.0,12.0,Jumilla,Casa Castillo,"Medicinality, animal notes and rubbery scents interfere with this magenta-colored Monastrell's berry aromas. Scratchy and somewhat abrasive on the palate, with high acidity, this tastes of herbal plum and medicinal raspberry, with a gripping finish."
Italy,90.0,29.0,Alto Adige,St. Pauls,"This refreshing sparkling wine is made entirely from Chardonnay. It offers pear and Golden Delicious apple aromas and flavors, along with a hint of baked bread and almond notes. It's elegant, with a creamy texture and crisp acidity."
France,88.0,30.0,Sancerre,Domaine Paul Thomas,"An unusually rich wine for Sancerre, this is packed with apple and pear fruits, with a soft touch of honey to fill out the palate. It is ripe, full of fruit and immediately drinkable, soft at the end while still fresh."
France,84.0,53.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau de Belcier,"Jammy, overripe fruit does not help this wine. Its soft tannins and acidity provide some pleasure, but that clumsy fruit gets in the way."
US,87.0,18.0,Anderson Valley,Handley,"As pretty and polished as California GewÃ¼rztraminer gets. Shows fabulous Anderson Valley acidity and minerality undergirding varietal flavors of sweet Asian spices, pears, peaches, limes and honeysuckle flowers. With its dry finish, it's a rich accompaniment to Vietnamese or Thai food."
US,88.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,"A majority Cabernet Sauvignon with 14% Merlot blended in, Artemis is aromatically inviting in dark plum, currant and a streak of herb. Light, lean and well-balanced, the wine features soft, barely perceptible tannins. Tri-tip is a wise pairing suggestion."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Alto Adige,Peter Zemmer,"Aromas of wisteria and green apple lead the way on this straightforward white. The tangy palate tastes of juicy pear, citrus and a hint of white almond while zesty acidity and a mineral note give the finish a slight lift."
Argentina,88.0,15.0,Mendoza,Tapiz,"This opaque Malbec smells grapy, with foxy animal notes mixed in. Flush on the palate, but with abrasive tannins, this tastes like it smells: grapy blackberry with herbal notes and mild toast make up the flavor profile. A dark, blackened finish is big and spicy more than fruity and refined."
US,90.0,23.0,Finger Lakes,N. Kendall Wines,"2012 marks only the second vintage for winemaker Nathan Kendall, but this dry, exceptionally stony Riesling suggests a promising start already. Fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, it's exquisitely spry but concentrated in lime, blossom and white grapefruit notes."
US,83.0,8.0,Lodi,Peltier,"This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish."
US,85.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Longwood,"Elegance, not opulence, marks this Chardonnay. It's very dry and acidic, with citrus, herb and toast flavors. Don't look here for a big, fat, buttery, ripe style, because you won't find it."
US,89.0,29.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Northstar,"A Merlot-dominated blend, this lush and appealing wine greets you with a pretty, toasty bouquet, leading into a mix of plum, stem, wood, coffee and toasted coconut flavors. The fruit thins out a bit more quickly than you'd hope, but the flavors are good and consistent throughout."
US,89.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Still Waters,"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 8% Petite Sirah and 5% Cabernet Franc shows aromas of sweet plum, cherry jam, grape candy and chocolate spices. The palate presents a medium level of density, with flavors of Bing cherry, ollallieberry and dried oregano, thyme and marjoram."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Greco di Tufo,I Capitani,"This luminous Greco di Tufo offers beautiful tones of stone fruit, pear, Golden Delicious apple, herb and white stone. The wine is fresh and fragrant with a polished feel and a crisp close."
US,91.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Script,"This wine is a blend of Two Blondes Cabernet Franc (50%), Benches Merlot (34%) and Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon. Appealing scents of green herb, dark cherry and barrel spice are followed by plentiful cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows an exquisite sense of balance along with a lengthy finish."
US,92.0,60.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sleight of Hand,"This wine, which is 100% varietal, is a blend from the Upland, Stoney Vine and French Creek vineyards. Fermented using 75% whole cluster and seeing just 15% new oak, the emphasis is on freshness and purity. It displays aromas of stems, white pepper, earth, funk and black olive, with the Stoney Vine influence winning out. The earthy and savory palate-coating flavors heighten the interest, with fruit and savory notes sailing on the finish. There are lots of good things going on but it needs time to come together. Best after 2019."
US,85.0,40.0,Oakville,Robert Mondavi,"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average."
US,89.0,39.0,Russian River Valley,Tessier Winery,"This producer makes small amounts of minimal-intervention wines from a handful of California appellations and this one does a good job of capturing Russian River. Peppery and steeped in dried herb and lavender, it goes light on the oak to show tightly woven tannin and structure, but the floral aromatics, especially of rose, really shine."
US,92.0,29.0,Monterey,Boekenoogen,"Baked strawberries, peppercorns and lavender flowers converge for a dynamic nose on this bottling, which also offers scents of sea-salt caramel and toasted oak. There's lots of vibrancy to the sip, where beef char, oregano, marjoram and thyme give nuance to the full-bodied, black pepper-laced blackberry jam."
France,94.0,132.0,Condrieu,E. Guigal,"This seems a tad more restrained than usual for La Doriane, which has typically been extremely lush and exotic in the past. The 2012 isn't as over the top, but still shows plenty of ripe apricot and tropical fruit framed by smoky oak and baking spices. The finish is long and mouthwatering, suggesting at least a few years of longevity."
US,87.0,14.0,Washington,Shooting Star,Aromas of corn on the cob and spice lead to lightly sweet-seeming medium-bodied fruit flavors that bring a sense of balance. It provides easy drinking appeal.
US,88.0,14.0,Rogue Valley,Foris,"Tart and fruity, this Riesling bears flavors of apple and white peach, with an extra dimension of citrus rind. Balanced and lively, the fruit rules the day."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Stickybeak,"Dark cherry and vanilla aromas swirl around crisper flavors of rhubarb in this tight, leathery wine made in a restrained, savory style. Made for the table, it'll suit many meals with versatile aplomb."
France,91.0,20.0,CÃ´tes du Roussillon Villages Tautavel,GÃ©rard Bertrand,"This is an immediately attractive and approachable wine, with direct and intense aromas and flavors of black cherry, plum and boysenberry accented by notes of sweet smoke, mocha and pepper. Firm yet approachable, this is well-balanced with structured tannins and ample acidity. Drink from 2015-2018."
US,88.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Martin Ray,"Dry, creamy and crisp in acidity, this has rich pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors. It's easy to drink and enjoy."
France,89.0,21.0,Alsace,Domaine Ehrhart,"Delivers strawberries, resin and golden raisins upfront while exotic spices dominate the palate. Petroleum notes on the finish indicate that it has already reached maturity though the fresh acidity will allow it to improve for a few more years in bottle."
US,85.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,ChÃ¢teau Bianca,"The low alcohol suggests fruit that was minimally ripened, and the flavors seem closer to fresh greens than ripe fruit. There's a splash of gooseberry, again quite tart, and a leesy texture. Drink chilled with a fresh salad."
Spain,84.0,9.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.
US,91.0,24.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Shane Wines,"Melon, sea salt and white peach aromatics lean into a pomelo pith and wet concrete backbone on this crisp, nearly austere and completely impressive bottling. There is great lime peel and yellow grapefruit tension to the palate, which is linear and acid-driven, and possesses a chalky texture as well as warmer yellow pear flavors."
Argentina,84.0,24.0,Patagonia,Nemesio,"Mulchy on the nose, with compost, leather and purple fruit notes. There's decent body to the wine but the flavors are stalky and green, with burnt, stemmy leftovers on the finish. A blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,86.0,25.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Z'IVO,"Some rosÃ©s are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up."
US,91.0,50.0,Livermore Valley,Steven Kent,"This starts with toasty, spicy oak aromas, then deep fruit flavors emerge on layers of fine-grained tannins and last through the finish. While bold-tasting and full bodied, it's not overdone. The ripe black cherry notes are balanced by crisp raspberry and cranberry, and an underlying bright acidity keeps it zooming."
US,88.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Bon Niche,"The tannins give this wine a lockdown feeling, making it hard and astringent. But the fruit is strong and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it's forward and one-dimensional now, but delicious, and unlikely to improve with age."
US,90.0,27.0,Sonoma County,Imagery,"The wine is refreshing and unoaked, allowing pure fruit flavors to star, and the brisk acidity is just about perfect. A splash of Muscat Canelli brings a rich orange-honey note to Sauvignon's typical lemon and lime flavors."
US,86.0,31.0,California,Dante Robere,"A boisterous, easy-drinking red wine that gushes ripe fruit and sweet oak aromas. It tastes almost sweet, like blackberry jam, and seems soft-textured in spite of its full body."
US,88.0,26.0,Russian River Valley,Simi,"Drink this polished Chardonnay now with shellfish or chicken stew. It's crisp and minerally, with a hit of acidity backing up the citrus fruit, honey and vanilla oak flavors."
France,88.0,18.0,Saint-VÃ©ran,Vignerons des Terres SecrÃ¨tes,"This wine from the southern MÃ¢con appellation is crisp with a mineral edge as well as the ripe fruit of the vintage. It has a tangy, lemon-like texture that gives it a lift, adding to the fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink now."
US,85.0,18.0,Alexander Valley,Huntington,"Simple and direct, this tastes like blend of apricots, pears and mangos, with a gentle oak touch. It has pleasant acidity and nice warmth from the alcohol. Drink now."
Spain,89.0,17.0,Rioja,Valserrano,"Toasty melon and peach aromas are oaky but elegant, sort of like nice Burgundy. A round balanced palate definitely suggests quality Chardonnay, but this is 95% Viura and the rest Malvasia. Oak and spice flavors render white-fruit notes secondary, and the finish is more of the same. Drink through 2020."
US,90.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Seven Oxen,"This blend of 65% Grenache and 35% MourvÃ¨dre from a very promising winery in Paso shows both primary Concord grape tones alongside deeper elderberry fruit on the nose, with Dr. Pepper and baking spice aromas as well. The palate is very candied with blackberry fruit and caramel, proving quite easy to drink if a tad on the sweeter side of dry."
France,87.0,17.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau du CÃ¨dre,"Rich and fruity, this is full of red berry and black plum fruits, sustained by dense, powerful tannins. The wine manages to balance freshness with a solid, dry core."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Friuli Aquileia,Tenuta CÃ  Bolani,"This is a light, crisp Sauvignon with pretty mineral tones that are framed by exotic fruit and lime. The wine is lean in consistency but has just the right level of acidity to keep the palate fresh."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio,De Angelis,"This rosÃ© from Campania in southern Italy offers beautifully toned aromas of berry fruit, raspberry, cranberry and blueberry. The wine exhibits a dark pink color and an easy, light approach in the mouth. Pair it with salads or light pasta lunches. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers."
Argentina,94.0,169.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Luigi Bosca,"Ripe, loamy aromas of raisin and prune include notes of coconut and chocolate. Full and rugged on the palate, this Malbec-Cabernet combo tastes fully ripe and dark, with immense blackberry and prune flavors. Fig, prune and cassis notes grace a finish that's flush with chocolate and unbridled richness. Drink through 2024."
Italy,87.0,21.0,Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene,Masottina,"This sparkler has a touch of playful sweetness without being sticky or cloying. As far as its aromas are concerned, you'll detect citrus, floral notes, minerals and a slightly smoky or musky quality on the periphery."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Piave,Masottina,"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish. It's medium-bodied, with just a hint of unreleased CO2 to enliven it."
France,94.0,140.0,Corton,Au Pied du Mont Chauve,"Close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, this vineyard is one of the smallest of the Corton grand crus. This wine, still fresh while also closed up with tannins, is dark, structured and has the potential to age many years. Intense red-berry acidity and a tight, dry core still convey youthfulness. Drink this impressive wine from 2022."
US,86.0,40.0,Columbia Valley (WA),TruthTeller,This wine is 60% Syrah with the rest equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of blue fruit and glue are followed by light-bodied flavors that show astringency.
US,85.0,13.0,Lodi,Sharabella Wines,"Light, bright and balanced, this inexpensive Chardonnay is not complex and could use a little oomph in there somewhere, but has enough apple and pear flavor to get you through."
US,91.0,35.0,Napa Valley,Chappellet,"For this wine, grapes are sourced from cooler sites within the valley, as well as from a high-elevation site on Mount Veeder. Together, they provide a juicy, fleshy core of apple and pear girded by mineral-laden texture and tension. The finish is marked by oak-derived toast and brioche notes."
France,84.0,24.0,Bourgogne,Manuel Olivier,"This light-colored, soft and supple wine has a palate filled with red fruits. It's immediately drinkable, already showing signs of maturity."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Umbria,Bigi,"This blend of Merlot and Sangiovese offers a bright aroma of red berry with hints of orange peel and violet. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry and black pepper flavors in a straightforward and easy-drinking style."
US,84.0,25.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Three Saints,"Dry and firmly tannic, this Cab has upfront flavors of black currants, plums, mocha and cedary oak. There's some sharpness in the texture that limits ageability, but it's a pretty wine for now."
US,87.0,24.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"This looks deep and dark, smells like Port and tastes almost as rich as that. However, it's dry and not too high in alcohol, although the aroma and flavor of superripe grapes is similar. While bold in flavor and relatively big in texture, it's pretty smooth overall."
Italy,93.0,35.0,Chianti Classico,Nittardi,"This opulent Chianti Classico opens with aromas of violets, black berries, meat juices and spice. The delicious palate delivers concentrated black cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, clove and balsamic herbs. It's soft and round but at the same time it boasts alluring intensity."
Canada,90.0,50.0,Okanagan Valley,Foxtrot,"Though pale in color, this is a tannic and flavorful wine with an earthy underpinning. Lightly spiced red-fruit flavors unfold and gather strength midpalate. This nicely captures the elegance of Naramata Bench Pinot Noir."
US,90.0,45.0,Oakville,Croze,"This largely tannic wine clearly needs time to open in the glass or on the table. It initially shows herbal elements around a core of clove and black cherry. Well-made, it's structured and a good match for meals."
US,88.0,14.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Watermill,"A quick sniff and you're converted to this cool, refreshing white wine. The aromas carry the promise of citrus rind and sea salt; that tangy character livens up the cool fruit flavors also. Aged in stainless and neutral oak, just enough to soften up the midpalate while retaining its crisp definition."
US,88.0,30.0,Finger Lakes,Fox Run,"Beautifully floral on the nose with hints of fresh apple, lemon and peach, this dry, delicately textured Riesling fills the mouth with ripe grapefruit and lemon flavors. Its sprightly and crisp in character but finishes long with a hint of white-tea astringency."
France,86.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau de Pourcieux,"Tart, fresh and a bit chunky and rustic, this blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 20% Cinsaut features bold lime notes, scouring acidity and hints of crushed stone. Drink now."
US,93.0,42.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gramercy,"This is an outrageously appealing wine with aromas of smoke, dried herbs and abundant peppery spices. It's sensuous and layered in feel, with generous dark fruit and black pepper flavors. It shows a profound sense of elegance, purity and detail with a finish that seems unending?a complete knee buckler."
Argentina,89.0,50.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Full berry aromas are fresh but come with a lot of oak and spice. In the mouth, this Syrah (with 3% Viognier) is chewy and a bit syrupy, with minty, spicy flavors derived from loud oak. On the finish, it dries out and turns warm-to-hot as it fades away. A joint-venture wine between Trapiche and Joey Tensley of California."
France,86.0,18.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau du Cros,"Fresh and lightly fruity, it's crisp and fragrant. With great acidity and a touch of herbaceousness, it's ready to drink."
Argentina,85.0,17.0,Mendoza,Viejo Isaias,"Lactic oak, wood grain, pencil lead, animal hide, lemon peel and berry aromas make for a challenging bouquet. This is a bit flabby and low on spine, while soft flavors of jammy berry fruits are herbal and suggest juniper. Eucalyptus and raspberry flavors are prominent on the finish."
Spain,87.0,13.0,Somontano,Enate,"Gritty tomatoey aromas suggest rustic but underripe fruit. On the palate, this delivers a mix of freshness combined with a medium-full body. A mix of herbal berries and wood-based spice notes finish grabby and warm."
Italy,83.0,7.0,Veneto,Rivani,"From the Treviso area of the Veneto, this fragrant and floral Moscato sparkling wine offers sweet and chewy tones of peach syrup and ripe fruit."
France,91.0,125.0,Condrieu,E. Guigal,"Less flamboyant than the 2010, this is still an excellent wine. It's full bodied, rich and broad on the palate, delivering layers of honeyed apricot and citrus that finish warm, with a hint of caramel. Drink it over the next couple of years."
US,90.0,38.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Kontos,"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas intertwine with cranberry, black licorice, herb and dark fruit on a wine with a very distinctive aromatic profile. The cranberry and cherry flavors are quite soft for the variety, seeming a touch dried out at times but showing a pleasing sense of balance."
US,88.0,30.0,Applegate Valley,Plaisance Ranch,"Done in a somewhat rustic style, this three-clone blend fills the mouth with smoky, oaky, dried-cherry flavors. It's a full-bodied country red, tasty but not necessarily representative of most Oregon Pinots."
Spain,84.0,14.0,Rueda,ViÃ±a Mayor,"Prickly, sharp aromas of citrus, matchstick and haystack are low on fruit. This Verdejo has a sharp acidic feel and pyrazinic flavors of cactus and bell pepper along with standard citrus."
France,93.0,59.0,Chablis,Jean-Marc Brocard,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years."
US,89.0,60.0,Sonoma Valley,Schug,"Fruit is sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo and Rancho Salina for this elegant wine which is slight in black and blue fruit with a subtle notion of leather. Structurally, it has a deep complexity of tannins that remains integrated on the back of the palate. It's ready for the table."
US,82.0,50.0,Paso Robles,Eagle Castle,"Harsh and pruny, with overripe flavors that are like Port, except the wine is dry. Wildly over-priced for the quality."
US,85.0,36.0,Willamette Valley,Silvan Ridge,"This modest Pinot offers light strawberry fruit, a dash of cola, and a component of earth and stem that overtakes the finish. It hints at green tannins, with a bit of brown sugar sweetness, perhaps from aging in 30% new oak."
US,92.0,21.0,Willamette Valley,WillaKenzie Estate,"Rich and floral, this top-notch Pinot Blanc hits the palate with verve and ripe, complex fruit flavors. There's a streak of delicious vanilla under the honeydew and Meyer lemon richness, and the length and power are especially impressive for a Pinot Blanc."
Italy,87.0,30.0,Valtellina,BarbÃ can,"Bright and straightforward, this has aromas of red berry, espresso, anise and a whiff of Alpine herb. The taut palate shows sour cherry and white pepper set against a backbone of firm acidity and tightly wound tannins."
US,88.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,"The aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb and plum are reticent on first pour. On the palate, sweet fruit flavors are supported by lightly grainy tannins. It's straight down the fairway."
France,92.0,50.0,Chinon,Domaine Grosbois,"This wine comes from a single-parcel, walled vineyard on the north bank of the river Vienne. It is a ripe wine, with delicious cherry and spice flavors balanced with acidity and a firmly tannic core. The wine will age well, so drink now for the attractive fruit or wait until 2018."
US,90.0,20.0,Monterey County,Bernardus,"Almost always distinctive, and this year has unusual flair and finesse. Shows a Chablisian style of mineral, warm stone, and citrus, but with far richer streaks, like gold embedded in flint. Oak and lees are elegantly applied. More foodworthy than most California Chards."
US,90.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Decoy,"Smoothly seductive in bright red-berry and pomegranate fruit, this young Zinfandel comes from mostly Dry Creek Valley vineyards. Rippling in baking spice and subtle vanilla oak, it's a complete wine, with balanced acidity and mellowed tannins. Clean and long on the finish, it will complement rather than overpower a meal."
France,96.0,630.0,Montrachet,Louis Latour,"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024."
US,95.0,60.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Betz Family,"Seductive and complex, the inviting aromas mix incense, blueberries, cassis, licorice and threads of herb and graphite. Flavors are wrapped tightly and unfold gracefully through a long finish. The herbal side of Cabernet is noted without being intrusive. Classic, deep and expressive."
US,92.0,45.0,Ribbon Ridge,Matello,"The back label notes that this fruit is from the Whistling Ridge Vineyard. It's rich and concentrated, a mix of apple, pear and green banana. Creamy and dense, it coats the mouth and lingers deliciously."
Italy,92.0,73.0,Aglianico del Vulture,Paternoster,"Don Anselmo is among Basilicata's most important wines because it does a phenomenal job of highlighting the potential of this volcanic territory and the Aglianico grape. This interpretation focuses on soft, velvety tones of black cherry, graphite and spice that peel off in layers. The wine has a dark, concentrated color followed by great intensity, power and rock-hard tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging."
France,89.0,75.0,Champagne,Jeaunaux-Robin,"In keeping with the dry style that marks Jeaunaux-Robin Champagne, this is a taut, crisply fruity wine. It has light, bright fruits with a touch of more mature toast and cookie flavors. It's just ready to drink."
US,91.0,39.0,Sonoma Coast,Churchill Cellars,"This Pinot is made in a lighter style, but it's complex and interesting. It's marked by dryness and acidic crispness. The raspberry, cola and persimmon flavors are enriched with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Seems best now, but it could surprise over the next six years."
US,86.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,Michael Pozzan,"There is lots of charm in this soft, gentle Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but it offers some nice cherry, Dr. Pepper and spice flavors."
US,83.0,42.0,Paso Robles,Fralich,"A blend of Syrah and Zinfandel, this is a sharp, Porty wine with flavors of raisins and caramelized blackberries. It's semisweet and sharp on the finish."
US,91.0,24.0,Santa Barbara County,Nagy,"Wow, what a dynamic Viognier. One sip is all it takes for the wine to explode in tropical fruit, citrus, peach, honeysuckle, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. But it's no mere fruit bomb, balanced with acidity, dryness and minerality. Great price for a wine this rich and complex."
US,91.0,32.0,Wahluke Slope,Bunnell,"The concept here is a southern RhÃ´ne blend??7% Syrah, 17% Grenache, 19% Cinsault and 17% MourvÃ¨dre. With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual ChÃ¢teauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well. Despite its youth, this is seamless and focused; a complete and very successful wine with berry, cherry and sweet plum fruit flavors annotated with spice and bits of chocolate. Elegant, feminine and supple, this is a lovely bottle."
Italy,88.0,29.0,Rosso Piceno,Le Caniette,"Mature blackberry, cherry and oak sensations are in the forefront of this Montepulciano and Sangiovese blend. The palate delivers ripe fruit along with espresso, mocha, licorice and spice, alongside firm tannins."
US,88.0,21.0,Sonoma County,Francis Ford Coppola,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a fine everyday wine. It's dry, full-bodied and satisfying in blackberry, cola and currant flavors, with a nice kiss of oak. The alcohol level is nice and low. Ready to drink now."
US,86.0,39.0,Amador County,Domenico,"Tartness and moderate tannins lend plenty of mouth-puckering grip to this medium-bodied wine, and that tartness comes off as a touch of raspberry vinegar on the palate. It has an appealing earthy, iron-like quality and a definite textural bite."
Argentina,90.0,50.0,Mendoza,Rutini,"Deep, rubbery black-fruit aromas suggest prune and cassis along with blackened spices and toasty oak. The wine is flush and bursting with fruit and herbal notes. Cassis and berry flavors settle with blackened toast and menthol. Drink this Bordeaux-style blend through 2019."
US,87.0,26.0,Yakima Valley,Animale,"Not surprisingly, this young wine has dense, potent tannins, along with plenty of stem and herb accents. It's balanced texturally, and has rather acidic, young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry. At the moment it is the most chewy and tannic of all the 2010 reds from Animale."
US,87.0,25.0,Applegate Valley,Plaisance Ranch,"Pure varietal, this pushes the winery's characteristic oaky, smoky winemaking style to the limits. There's some bright, tart raspberry fruit in the mix, but the scents and flavors of charred wood dominate from first sniff to last swallow."
US,96.0,140.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Charles Smith,"The aromas pop, with notes of stargazer lilies, brown stems, green olive and smoked meat, revealing more on each swirl. The fruit and savory flavors are rich and layered, earthshaking in their intensity, with a lengthy finish that only heightens the interest. It's a complete showstopper."
Italy,86.0,20.0,Prosecco,Gino Fasoli,Aromas of spring wild flower and white stone fruit lead the nose on this straightforward offering. The simple palate offers yellow apple and pear alongside brisk bubbles and crisp acidity.
Spain,87.0,11.0,Rioja,Pagos del Rey,"Fresh, dry red-fruit aromas lead the charge on this tasty but simple Rioja that feels crisp, healthy and balanced. Flavors of plum, raspberry and herbs finish mild."
France,93.0,85.0,Champagne,Besserat de Bellefon,"The good 2006 vintage has produced this well-balanced wine that is now showing delicious signs of maturity. The initial fruit has gone, replaced by toast, spice and grilled almonds. At the same time, the acidity and taut mineral texture are still in play, giving a wine that is lively and just ready to drink now."
Spain,87.0,10.0,Rueda,Pablo del Villar,"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura."
US,88.0,42.0,Howell Mountain,W.H. Smith,"A very nice, elegant and complex Cab, showing firm mountain tannins that give a somewhat dry astringency to the rather sweet cherry, blackberry, mocha and cedar flavors. Its future is hard to predict. Now through 2010."
US,85.0,38.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Martinez & Martinez,"Upon first sniff, this could be a Chilean red; but then the warm fruity entry?complete with hints of crushed flower and fresh herb?suggests something else entirely. The wine does not hold together well, turning sour and herbal through the back of the palate."
France,89.0,40.0,Sancerre,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin,"A wine with great color, attractive smoky and red fruit flavors and a touch of tannin. It has a good structure as well, reflecting wood aging as well as fine fruit. Drink from 2016."
US,84.0,75.0,Coombsville,Ackerman,"Despite the relatively low alcohol, this wine feels curiously hot, enough to lower the score. Chili pepper notes dominate the fruit."
France,92.0,60.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"The light, stony soil of Les LaviÃ¨res produces structured, tight and firm wines, unlike many of the softer wines from Savigny. With new wood and licorice flavors, it is darkly textured and firm. The red fruits are still developing, showing the rich potential of the wine. Drink from 2017."
Argentina,87.0,13.0,Mendoza,Alamos,"Fruity on the nose, with a friendly mix of pineapple, apple, melon and powdered sugar aromas. Feels smooth and round but not heavy, with good acidity and likable, simple flavors of melon, banana and apple. There's a light note of toast on the finish."
France,92.0,43.0,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"Old vines and a Grand Cru vineyard have produced an impressive wine. It is bone dry and very crisp, but also has swathes of dense fruit and texture. It's very mineral and steely in style with youthful acidity and pink grapefruit flavors, but this is a wine to age. Drink from 2016."
Italy,84.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,"Paola Gloder's estate can do better than this, especially in a vintage like 1997. The wine is already showing signs of aging and it has a lightweight character. The fruit is pleasant enough, with soft tannins and ripeness, but it should be more exciting. Tasted twice."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Cesanese del Piglio,Marcella Giuliani,"Made with organically farmed fruit, this opens with dark aromas of licorice, plum, coffee and blackberry. It shows tight tannins and some astringency on the finish."
France,92.0,24.0,CÃ´tes du Jura,Domaine Labet,"Fruity and fragrant, this rich and complex wine also has a strong sense of acidity. Putting it all together, the wine has weight, aging potential and a fine, zesty, tight texture. It needs to age, so drink this fascinating wine from 2016."
US,85.0,28.0,Russian River Valley,Lola,"This easy-drinking Pinot Noir offers layers of softened cola, pomegranates, red licorice and pepper, wrapped into supple tannins. It's ready to drink now with everything from tuna tartare to roasted salmon and grilled burgers."
France,87.0,59.0,Champagne,Nicolas Feuillatte,"The onion-skin pink color sets the stage for an off-dry, just-sweet wine, that is crisp, yet soft and rounded. It has good weight, fresh raspberry flavor, and delicate sweetness, resulting in a wine that's crisp and textured."
France,90.0,37.0,Sancerre,Domaine Roblin,"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink."
US,91.0,44.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Jewell,"Fragrant and inviting in dark cherry, raspberry and cola spice, this medium-weight Pinot Noir is lush and meaty. Bright flavors veer from dark cherry to raspberry, with a pronounced lift of earth and herb. The wine is layered, beautifully textured and long in the finish."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,La Mannella,"Here is a rich and dense style of Brunello with bright berry tones and ripe cherry followed by cedar, cola and spice. The wine is rich and opulent in the mouth with great intensity, soft tannins and well integrated acidity. La Mannella really steps forward in terms of quality with this vintage."
US,85.0,26.0,Lodi,Michael David,"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful."
US,88.0,24.0,Sonoma County,Kendall-Jackson,"K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value. It's elegant in construction, with tailored tannins and acids and fine flavors of blackberries and currants that lead to a spicy finish."
US,86.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Walnut City WineWorks,"Stainless steel-fermented and kept on the lees for two months, this new vintage still feels a bit dilute?a function of the low brix and difficult vintage. Pungent with scents and flavors of rosemary and citrus, it is best drunk chilled and young."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Trentino,Gaierhof,"Here's a fragrant and delicate Chardonnay from the far north of Italy that delivers aromas of honeysuckle, passion fruit and almond skin. The wine has fresh appeal and zesty spice on the close that makes it a natural companion to fish and vegetable dishes."
US,88.0,50.0,York Mountain,Adelaida,"York Mountain is a little-known appellation in the western part of Paso Robles. This blend of two varieties is dry, tannic and hot, with complex blackberry, tobacco, plum and pepper flavors that are so ripe, they veer into raisins. Drink up."
Italy,89.0,25.0,Friuli Colli Orientali,Collavini,"Fragrant and linear, this has delicate scents of white spring flower and green apple while the bright palate offers white peach, pear and lemon peel. A light mineral note adds interest while zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish."
US,87.0,16.0,Oregon,Hinman,"Despite its youth this is quickly peaking in flavor. It's light but interesting, with rosewater, red apple and strawberry flavors. Tannins are soft and there's a suggestion of saddle leather. It offers plenty of enjoyment for a Pinot at this price."
US,90.0,36.0,North Fork of Long Island,Paumanok,"Created only in exceptional years like 2010, this is a beautiful example of New York Chardonnay. Elegant on the nose and palate, with penetrating notes of Meyer lemons, honey and waxy white flowers, this is an opulent, full-bodied wine that's judiciously oaked and concentrated through the finish. Drinks gorgeously now, but could easily hold 3-5 years."
US,90.0,200.0,Napa Valley,JCB,"This is a big-boned wine, showy in spearmint and eucalyptus, burly blackberry and tar. With integrated oak and tannin, it presents a respectable showing of approachably lush texture and succulence, the finish persistent in juicy fruit."
France,94.0,21.0,Moulin-Ã -Vent,Domaine Richard Rottiers,"Produced from vines that are up to 80-years-old and now organic, this concentrated wood-aged wine is perfumed, rich and firmly structured. Dark tannins line the wine supporting the black plum and cherry fruits and acidity. Richard Rottiers, new on the scene in 2007, created a cru that is going to be a very fine wine. Drink from 2018."
US,95.0,100.0,Willamette Valley,Ponzi,"A potpourri of exotic scents and flavors, this vineyard selection opens with scents of rose, raspberry, lavender and tea. The palate is generous and complex, mixing in nutmeg, chocolate, star anise and cola. Although it promises many years of life ahead, it's already too good to resist."
US,88.0,14.0,California,Apothic,"Lightly sweet and rich in both flavor and body, this wine has generous ripe pear and peach notes accented with coconut and vanilla. A layered effect to the flavors and an especially creamy texture make it very tempting."
US,90.0,47.0,Napa Valley,World's End,"Named for a great David Bowie song, this wine would appeal to Ziggy Stardust himself with its chameleon-like ability to swing between steely and sultry, almost sweet, diving into decadence with ease. Lemon peel and grilled pineapple marry well with generous yet managed oak, finishing creamy and quick."
US,85.0,25.0,Spring Mountain District,Chateau Chevalier,"This is a Cabernet to drink now for its soft, enjoyable flavors of blackberry and cherry pie. It tastes sweet but finishes nicely dry, with a scour of tannins."
US,89.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Armida,"Oak, acidity and tropical fruit comprise this dry Chardonnay. It's one of Armida's better efforts, showing ripe, flashy mango, buttered toast and mineral flavors that finish bright and spicy."
US,92.0,42.0,Napa Valley,Vinum Cellars,"Impressive at any price, but especially notable at this cost, this 100% varietal red is a testament to the power and concentration of the vintage, integrated with a push of tannin on the back of the tongue. Spicy clove and pepper ride a wave of cassis, dark cherry and chocolate, needing time to unwind in the glass. It will do well in the cellar through 2028."
US,85.0,20.0,Santa Barbara County,Chessman,"Toasted hazelnuts, lime zest and broad peach notes show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is relatively flat and easy with yellow apples and a tang of lemongrass with a buttered finish."
US,87.0,24.0,Alexander Valley,Simi,"A dry, lovely Cabernet for drinking now. Shows the soft tannins and herbaceousness of Alexander Valley reds, with cherry, berry, currant and oak flavors. Earns extra points for the smooth, spicy finish."
Italy,93.0,36.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Villa S. Anna,"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon."
Spain,91.0,45.0,Bierzo,Godelia,"Dense, roasted, earthy aromas of lightly stewed berry fruits and leather set up a deep, oaky palate with baked, loamy dark-fruit flavors that finish smooth, mellow and rich in feel. This is luxurious MencÃ­a with modest acidity; drink through 2017."
US,92.0,36.0,Dry Creek Valley,Quivira,"Made from 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% MourvÃ¨dre, this is a thick, extracted exploration of strawberry and leather. Bright and brawny, it has supportive freshness and acidity beneath the power of its meaty ripe fruit."
Spain,87.0,17.0,Cava,Mistinguett,"This wayward wine shows yeasty aromas, generic red fruit and citrus flavors and a cleansing finish."
Italy,93.0,50.0,Toscana,Tenuta Sette Cieli,"A blend of 30% Malbec, 30% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of ripe blackberries, Mediterranean herbs and cedar. The firmly structured palate doles out layers of black currants, blackberries, white pepper and licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2022."
France,87.0,30.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Maison Matisco,"This wine is ripe yet still crisp, with a touch of honey flavor and apricot fruit lending ripeness, pulled taut by a tang of orange zest-like acidity. It's delicious and ready to drink, finishing on mineral texture."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Catalunya,Torres,"This has berry fruit aromas that don't fully register as crisp and spunky. It feels narrow and tastes tart and tangy, with red plum and cherry pie flavors. Punchy and refreshing."
US,92.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"This has traditionally been a top bottling for Sojourn, and the 2011 is especially good. The vibrant acidity and pineapple, tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors are intense and pure. Drink it now and over the next three years."
France,86.0,16.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Manoir du Carra,"While the wine has a crisp side, it's also full of red fruits and soft tannins. That makes for a wine that's fragrant, fruity, ready to drink and not likely to age much. Enjoy it now."
US,91.0,20.0,Willamette Valley,Harper Voit,"This conveys creamy richness while seeming almost weightless. The color of bright straw-gold, it's crisply defined, with citrus flesh and rind, melon and lemon verbena highlights."
Italy,93.0,259.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio di Sotto,"Poggio di Sotto has steadily worked over the years to produce extremely elegant and polished expressions of Brunello that show the best of the local territory. Candied fruit, smoke, light shadings of licorice and tobacco, crushed mineral and white pepper appear on the bouquet. But there's just enough fresh cherry fruit to make your mouth pucker."
US,89.0,22.0,North Fork of Long Island,Raphael,"Wet cedar, dried leaves and mushroom notes extend a woodsy, earthy tone to ripe black cherry and plums in this unusually savory, nuanced Merlot. Supple and ripe, it extends languorously on the palate, fringed by fine tannins and an appetizing touch of bitterness on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
US,90.0,28.0,Red Mountain,Convergence Zone,"The sister wine to the Squall Line Red, this is another Bordeaux-style blend, with Merlot in the central role. It's sleek and well-crafted, with purple fruits, delicate toast and a creamy, lattÃ©-like finish."
Spain,88.0,22.0,Bierzo,Luna Beberide,"Big, chunky and dark on the nose, but smells monotone except for a floral hint. The palate shows nice body, saturation and grabby tannins to go with oak-infused flavors of black plum, cola and spice. Savory and rooty on the finish. A good restaurant wine, either by the glass or bottle."
Australia,84.0,16.0,Strathbogie Ranges,Cooralook,"Lean, tart and slightly ungenerous on the palate, but the flavors are authentically Pinot Noir, ranging from earth and root vegetables to pie cherries and herbs. Clean and crisp on the finish."
US,88.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Longboard,"From the producer's estate vineyard, the grapes planted on budwood from Napa Valley's famous Three Palms, this wine is bittersweet in tannin and flavor, a mix of blueberry, cedar, resin and clove. Full bodied in style, it maintains an elegance on the finish, marked irresistibly in dark chocolate."
US,96.0,200.0,Napa-Monterey-Mendocino,Schramsberg,"This spectacular brut-style sparkler that's made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir still has plenty of tart acidity and yeastiness, providing the backdrop for rich, concentrated flavors of lime, raspberry, orange, brioche, mineral, vanilla and spice. It's enjoyable now, a tÃªte de cuvÃ©e that is among the best California bubblies of the year, and it will continue to develop bottle complexity for many years."
US,93.0,50.0,Chehalem Mountains,Vidon Vineyard,"This single-clone cuvÃ©e really shines in 2014, with concentrated berry and cherry fruit, accented with toasty oak. The persistence and follow-through takes you down a lush flavor trail, with touches of caramel, sassafras and cola along the way."
France,94.0,37.0,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl,"Gently perfumed hints of ripe pear almost seem to have a floral dimension. On the palate the mellow, generous and totally ripe pear fruit unfolds fully and gives glimpses of very juicy ripe, dried and baked fruit. All of this richness is countered by lemony freshness. There is an earthy textural element, and more shimmering fruit reminiscent of bottled mirabelle plums. This is generous and just off dry, with a concentrated, convincing and very moreish balanced richness."
Italy,85.0,18.0,Rosso Conero,Fattoria Le Terrazze,"Made from 100% Montepulciano, this opens with unusual aromas of tire rubber. Dense black fruit flavors are accented with hints of white pepper alongside astringent tannins. Already approachable, the palate is straightforward and one dimensional. Drink soon."
US,88.0,30.0,Red Mountain,Januik,"All varietal from one of the state's most highly regarded vineyards, this wine offers aromas of dark raspberries, green herbs, vanilla and barrel spices. The fruit and barrel flavors show concentration and depth, with a light chalkiness to the tannins."
Argentina,88.0,22.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Luigi Bosca,"Reedy red-fruit aromas are woody and a touch medicinal. This feels round but edgy, with grabby prodding tannins. Savory herbal berry flavors with salted plum notes finish with overt oak and rubbery tannins."
US,86.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,Q,"Oaky and tart, with pineapple crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, Asian pear, vanilla and buttered popcorn flavors. A good, crisp Chardonnay to drink now."
US,90.0,40.0,Mendocino County,Kale,"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Soave Classico,Cantine Lenotti di Lenotti,"Here's the quintessential Soave Classico that veers on the side of informality and easy-drinking appeal. The wine is redolent of white peach, citrus and Golden Delicious apple."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Toscana,Castello d'Albola,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this offers aromas of dark-skinned fruit, exotic spice, French oak and a whiff of underbrush. Smooth and firmly structured, the elegant palate delivers cassis, black cherry and star anise alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018??028."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Maremma,Rocca di Frassinello,"Here's a bright, fruit-forward red blend (with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese) that offers tonic aromas of white cherry and wild berries. There's a slight touch of almond skin at the back and the wine cuts clean over the palate thanks to its acidity and fresh berry flavors. It is aged in stainless steel and cement for crisp, easy flavors."
US,93.0,24.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Loring Wine Company,"The nose on this well-priced appellation blend by Brian Loring has it all: golden honey, caramel apple, supple peach flesh, pressed white flowers, fresh yellow flowers and even quinine. The apple-flesh flavors show oak influence in hints of butterscotch and pineapple, yet the mouthwatering acidity keeps it all in balance."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Maremma,Pieve Vecchia,"A pure expression of Syrah from coastal Tuscany, Pieve dei Monaci offers a chewy texture and thick layers of black fruit, prune, cola, spice and smoked bacon. Pair this wine with grilled meat."
Italy,87.0,29.0,Val di Cornia Suvereto,Gualdo del Re,"Gualdo del Re's honey-toned Vermentino offers rich saturation and density thanks to the Tuscan sunshine. The wine is thick and glossy with warm notes of peach, nectarine and apricot. The finish is creamy and rich and would stand up to cheese-based dishes."
US,85.0,38.0,Willamette Valley,Spindrift Cellars,"For a reserve from what is generally acclaimed as a stellar vintage in the Willamette Valley, this wine seems thin and watery. Watermelon and raspberry fruit leads into an acidic, one-dimensional finish."
US,90.0,39.0,Lodi,Mikami Vineyards,"This is a full-bodied but easy-drinking wine with ample ripe fruit flavors and attractive accents from oak aging, like vanilla, nutmeg and a touch of brown sugar. It coats the mouth with rich fruitiness and lingers on the finish in a compelling manner."
Italy,90.0,28.0,Etna,Le Vigne di Eli,"This fresh white wine from Mt. Etna offers pristine aromas of honey, peach cream and white mineral. Lasting notes of brimstone and slate give the wine added dimension and you will surely imagine a natural pairing with seafood or shellfish risotto."
France,87.0,20.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Louis Bouillot,"With its strawberry flavor and tight acidity, this is an attractive, clean sparkling wine. It has just the right balance between acidity and bright fruit, leaving a textured aftertaste."
US,90.0,18.0,Russian River Valley,Martin Ray,"A pretty bouquet of wild strawberry invites one into this wine that's faint pink in color and pleasantly awash in citrus flavor and aroma. Mellow and long-lasting on the finish, it's refreshingly crisp in acidity and light in alcohol."
Italy,89.0,40.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Podere Paganico,"This earthy wine opens with rather funky aromas of tilled soil, leather and a whiff of barnyard. The hearty palate offers ripe black cherry, game and savory herb alongside chewy tannins. It's a bit rustic but has charm. Drink 2018??025."
Italy,91.0,38.0,Chianti Classico,Rocca delle MacÃ¬e,"Plush, fruit-forward and soft, Riserva di Fizzano shows a modern, confident style. The wine's appearance already shows darker hues of aging and the bouquet is characterized by dark fruit, leather and spice."
Italy,88.0,55.0,Barbaresco,Cascina Bruciata,"Aromas of bright berry, tobacco and a balsamic note come together in the glass. The palate offers raw red berry, black cherry, white pepper and anise alongside sleek tannins and bright acidity. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink after 2018."
Argentina,85.0,15.0,Uco Valley,Andeluna,"Crisp, minerally aromas are low on fruit. Zesty, lively and citric on the palate, this tastes lean, linear and sharp, with orange notes and a salty aftertaste. A briny tasting, tangy finish fits the bill."
US,82.0,45.0,Sonoma Valley,Eric Ross,"Too ripe, almost Porty, although it's bone dry. Shows flavors of currants, chocolate and raisins, with a bitterness throughout."
US,88.0,14.0,Mendocino County,Shooting Star,"This wine smells and tastes clean and fresh, like green apples and chopped celery, then gains a little more heft and ripeness on the tongue to complete a good profile. It has crisp acidity and great balance, and will be very versatile with food."
France,87.0,18.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau les Valentines,"This is the equivalent of a second wine from Les Valentines, a lighter version of the estate wine. With lively acidity, it is fruity while rounded, crisp but also sweet with ripe strawberry flavors. The acidity at the end is soft, light and bright."
US,87.0,15.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Canoe Ridge,"Butterscotch and roasted corn-on-the-cob aromas are followed by an off-dry, viscous, creamy feeling palate. Vanilla notes persist on the finish."
France,88.0,105.0,Alsace,Marc Kreydenweiss,"Another wacky Riesling from Marc Kreydenweiss, this one somehow works. There's Asian spice here and an odd collection of oxidative aromas but also undeniable concentration and good length. Serve this unusual wine by itself or with Indian fare."
Spain,87.0,18.0,Rioja,Finca del Marquesado,"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Mendoza,La Posta,"Standard-issue berry and plum aromas turn warm and leathery with airing. The palate on this Malbec-Bonarda-Syrah blend is juicy, but it comes with a choppy feel. Tastes brambly and wild, with red berry fruit and a briary, leathery finish."
US,88.0,17.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors."
Italy,86.0,48.0,Chianti Classico,Stomennano,"This opens with subdued aromas of menthol, dried herb and spiced plum. The palate is rather evolved, offering dried cherry, coffee, clove and a hint of black tea framed in close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink sooner rather than later to capture what fruit remains."
France,86.0,20.0,Menetou-Salon,Fournier PÃ¨re et Fils,"Soft and already round, this is a fruity wine with gentle spice, melon and fresh lime juice. It still has its youthful lemon-zest tang although it is filling out, losing its minerality and gaining a layer of ripe yellow fruits. Drink now."
US,94.0,80.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cayuse,"Light in color, this Ã¼ber aromatic wine conveys flowers, black and green olive, mineral, peat and smoke. The palate is all about elegance of expression and texture, with smoked meat and coffee flavors that linger."
Australia,85.0,21.0,Western Australia,Plantagenet,"Leads off with dusty, nutty, sugary aromas, like the bottom of the bag of honey-roasted peanuts, but there's also hints of buttered toast, ripe pears and black pepper. Flavors are simpler?caramel and pineapple?and it's heavy on the palate."
US,92.0,80.0,Napa Valley,The Grade,"Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined. Fine now, with a good decant, and should age well for a decade."
US,91.0,28.0,Edna Valley,Claiborne & Churchill,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018??034."
US,91.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Sinclair Estate Vineyards,"The aromas of lees, citrus, almond, melon, apple, spice and butter draw you into the glass. This wine brings a dazzling sense of texture, with fruit and spice flavors dappled throughout."
Spain,90.0,33.0,Rioja,Baigorri,Waxy lightly toasted aromas of yellow apple are more subtle than popping. This barrel-fermented wine offers good weight and balance along with quiet flavors of spiced apple and vanilla. A sophisticated clean finish is lightly oaked in flavor and smooth in feel.
US,89.0,18.0,Umpqua Valley,Abacela,"The 11th vintage of Abacela's AlbariÃ±o is a racy wine, with excellent varietal character. Fruit flavors suggest a mix of cucumber, apple, citrus and melon. There's a trace of oyster shell minerality and a bracing whiff of sea breeze on the finish."
US,91.0,50.0,Sonoma Mountain,Argot,"Funky in spearmint and a carbonic notion of freshness, this wine offers cranberry and barely ripe strawberry, adding to its sense of delicacy. Mild shakes of white pepper play on the palate, as the finish finds a bolder weight of tannin."
France,93.0,90.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau d'Esclans,"This delicious wine offers subtle barrel nuances, with ripe plum and strawberry fruits. Along with this is a stylish crispness, just touched by spice and toast. This is a serious wine, intended for food."
US,82.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Castoro Cellars,"A bit unripe, with some vegetal flavors along with the blackberries. There's also a lot of sweet heat from high alcohol."
US,89.0,24.0,Monticello,Trump,"Crisp green apple meets rounded yellow pear on the nose of this 100% Chardonnay sparkler. Weighty and round on the palate, fine bubbles lift up the flavors of lemon pastry and apple blossom, finishing clean and lightly toasty."
France,94.0,75.0,CÃ´te RÃ´tie,E. Guigal,"The essence of the appellation smokes out from the glass, offering hints of cracked pepper, bacon, clove and leather. It's reasonably full-bodied for CÃ´te RÃ´tie, with feral, smoked-meat flavors, ample spice and plenty of the concentrated plummy fruit. Tannins are silky, making this approachable now, but likely capable of aging well for at least 10??5 years."
Italy,93.0,96.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Poggio Antico,"Poggio Antico is one of the brightest stars in 2004 Brunello di Montalcino. Paola Gloder and her team deliver a gorgeous wine that reaches to the highest levels of aromatic richness and intensity. The wine is succulent, concentrated and elegant with amazing persistency. Only the slight sourness of its tannins prevented it from scoring higher. Age five more years."
US,91.0,27.0,Russian River Valley,Novy,"This big, soft, delicious Syrah tastes like a candy bar. It's rich and sweet in blackberry jam, blueberry pie with the crust, cocoa and spice flavors, with an umami tanginess like bacon. Easy to savor it through the entire bottle, although the alcohol level is high."
Australia,91.0,60.0,Clare Valley,Two Hands,"This wine's elevated alcohol level (16.2%) gives it plenty of fullness on the palate, and combined with jammy fruit and superripe tannins makes for a slightly sweet palate impression and a creamy texture. It does offer waves of raspberry and blueberry fruit topped by hints of cinnamon and vanilla as well as savory undercurrents of grilled meat and tapenade. Drink now and over the next few years for its exuberant fruit."
US,92.0,48.0,Temecula Valley,Lorenzi Estate,"A powerful take on the grape, this shows dried cherries, cherry blossoms, black pepper and torn-up concrete aromas on the nose. The palate is rich and luscious, with concentrated strawberries, smoked plums and purple flowers, as well as licorice, fudge and just enough roasted red bell pepper to show the varietal's greener side."
US,88.0,36.0,Livermore Valley,McGrail,"Another nice effort from McGrail, a Cab from their estate vineyards that shows dark plum, vanilla and tobacco and a soft roundness, all around its tannins crying out for red meat."
US,89.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow."
France,85.0,19.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,ChÃ¢teau Mont-Redon,"This is a plump, perky little red, full of ripe, bouncy cherry fruit on the nose and palate. It's an easy quaff that falls away quickly on the finish."
Italy,85.0,27.0,Morellino di Scansano,Bruni,"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals earthy aromas suggesting underbrush, moist soil and toast while the lean palate offers roasted coffee bean, oak, espresso and anise. It lacks fruit richness while fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish."
Argentina,87.0,16.0,Mendoza,Domaine Bousquet,"Racy plum and cherry aromas lead to an edgy palate with bold acidity. Crisp, foxy flavors of raspberry and plum finish spicy and with pronounced acidity. This wine emphasizes acidity and freshness over ripeness and heft."
Italy,96.0,146.0,Barolo,Giuseppe Rinaldi,"Multifaceted aromas of rose, iris, leather, cranberry, truffle and the barest hint of game lead the nose. The radiant palate offers creamy strawberry, ripe red cherry, orange zest, baking spice, dried herb and tobacco alongside firm but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance while a mineral vein energizes the finish. With its smooth texture, it's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018??026."
US,92.0,44.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Black Ridge,"A bit of bottle age has made this vintage quite fascinating, with cola, black tea, black plum and mulberry on this wine's deep and peppery nose. The flavor profile is hearty with star anise and dried spearmint as well as deeper dried red-fruit touches. The texture is mild but the overall experience is complete."
Italy,87.0,60.0,Collio,Attems,"Aromas of toast, nut, oak and yellow stone fruit emerge on this linear white. The palate is rather lean, offering grapefruit, mineral, thyme and a hint of roasted coffee bean alongside crisp acidity."
US,95.0,160.0,Mount Veeder,Hall,"A structured, concentrated and classically crafted 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Sanguine red currant and rhubarb combine with darker, more brooding tangles of blackberry and clove to define this beauty, enhanced by a velvety texture and lingering accents of cedar, pine and dried herb."
France,85.0,22.0,Menetou-Salon,Jean-Max Roger,"This is an easy, open wine that is lightly herbal. There is a barnyard edge that masks the fruit, although there is bright crisp acidity to give it a lift. Drink now."
Spain,82.0,12.0,Ribera del Guadiana,Bodegas Medina,"Jammy and candied smelling, this has a green element akin to alfalfa or mint. It's clampy, tannic and high in acid, with raspberry and plum notes that offer an oak offset. The flavors turn tangy and sharp on the finish, even as a heavy vanilla flavor settles in."
Italy,88.0,39.0,Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze,De Faveri,"Jasmine, aromatic herb and pear aromas waft out of the glass. The bright, creamy palate doles out ripe green apple, candied nectarine zest, ginger and a mineral note alongside fresh acidity and frothy bubbles. This is a fun, delicious sparkler for all occasions."
Argentina,88.0,16.0,Mendoza,Sottano,"Spicy, dry aromas of earth, red currant and black olive offer some complexity and style. This is full bodied, racy and loaded with black cherry, cassis and peppery spice flavors. A touch of heat and menthol adds jolt to the finish."
Argentina,85.0,15.0,Mendoza,Durigutti,"Raisiny and earthy on the nose, this Bonarda also offers damp aromas of fern and tobacco. Chunky, with a soft, flat palate, this tastes raisiny and stewed. Low acidity and raisiny flavors on the finish are consistent with what came before."
France,88.0,13.0,CÃ´tes de Bergerac,ChÃ¢teau BÃ©lingard,"This ripe, fruity and structured wine is still young and the tannins need time to round out. However, it is already rich, with juicy red fruits and a core of fragrant acidity. The wine is dense and worth aging. Drink from 2017."
US,87.0,22.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Voila!,"Lighter in color, this blend of Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc and Syrah has aromas and flavors of mesquite smoke, strawberry and cherry, with the Pinot seemingly in the lead. The smoky flavors are medium bodied, with a light grip of chalky tannins."
US,87.0,35.0,Monticello,Veritas,"Named after the winery's cellar master, the nose of this wine is deep and brooding in black cherry punch and spicy blackberry, accented by sawdust and anise. Velvety tannins frame the medium-bodied palate, offering substantial grip to a mix of tart mixed berries, with coffee and violet on the finish."
US,88.0,34.0,Santa Barbara County,La Montagne,"The vineyard is in the Santa Maria Valley, and the wine shows that area's crisp acidity, as well as long hangtime orange, Meyer lemon and golden mango fruit flavors. It's a rich, interesting wine to drink now."
Australia,88.0,23.0,McLaren Vale,Kangarilla Road,"Long a steak house staple, Kangarilla Road's Shiraz mixes dark berries and plums with touches of cedar, caramel and vanilla. The creamy-textured tannins pick up just enough dustiness on the finish to match well with fatty cuts, like ribeyes. Drink now-2015."
US,93.0,55.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Big Basin,"Pine resin, bay leaf and cedar aromas give depth and intriguing forest floor nuance to the tart cranberry and red flower scents on the nose of this bottling. The palate is extremely savory, with incense, damp anise and more woody spice flavors decorating the sour plum fruit. Light, energetic and extremely flavorful."
France,89.0,17.0,Savoie,Domaine de l'Idylle,"From 50 year old vines, this fruity wine is both crisp and clean and also full of warmer flavors. Citrus, pear and apricot notes all mingle in this delicious, concentrated wine. Drink now."
Australia,84.0,7.0,South Eastern Australia,Blue Tongue,"Though it's 100% Chardonnay, this wine doesn't taste particularly Chard-like: it has light floral and stone fruit notes more akin to a Riesling. It's a lightweight in the mouth, rounded out by a little creaminess. A decent, economical choice to quaff on a hot day."
France,91.0,27.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Collovray et Terrier,"Spicy, toasty wine, the fruit tropically rich. The texture is dense, the acidity important but not dominant. Delicious wine, now maturing well."
Italy,91.0,21.0,Alto Adige,Abbazia di Novacella,"This 100% Pinot Nero offers enticing aromas of fragrant blue flower, wild red berry and a whiff of baking spice. The sleek savory palate delivers raspberry, green tea, graphite and a white pepper note. Fresh acidity and firm but refined tannins provide balance. Enjoy soon."
US,89.0,32.0,Oregon,Citation,"Barrel-fermented, this is bright and heavily flavored with sweet new oak. It's young and forward, but will benefit from additional bottle age in order to integrate fully the barrel flavors with the crisp, clean, apple-flavored fruit."
US,84.0,11.0,California,Cycles Gladiator,"This has a traditional garnet color with a light rim. It smells a bit earthy and herbal and tastes rather lean, like rhubarb and sour-cherry candy. It's light to medium bodied, a bit quirky but enjoyable."
Argentina,86.0,25.0,Mendoza,Don Miguel GascÃ³n,"Gritty aromas of saddle leather, horse hide and pickled berries filter into a choppy feeling palate with briny and herbal flavors. There's also notes of berries and salt. A chewy finish has weight, structure and saucy, pickled flavors of savory berry fruits."
Italy,92.0,58.0,Barbaresco,Produttori del Barbaresco,"Aromas of violet, forest floor, ripe berry and a whiff of new leather emerge on this structured red. The ripe, full-bodied palate delivers mouthfuls of juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, menthol and white pepper set against a backbone of assertive but velvety-textured tannins. Drink through 2018??2026."
US,93.0,75.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Decroux,"This bottling's core of black cherry fragrance is wrapped in sugar plum, balsamic, allspice and nutmeg notes, combining elegance and power. Mulberry and wild cherry flavors show on the palate, lifted by baking spice and gingerbread accents and balanced by solid acidity and tannins. A sagebrush note pops on the finish."
Italy,92.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Albino Rocca,"With a swirl, this wine's enticing new leather, eucalyptus, woodland berry and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The taut and savory palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and white pepper notes. Refined tannins and firm acidity provide balance while a hint of coffee signals the close. Drink 2020??029."
France,90.0,40.0,Alsace,Domaine Ostertag,"Earth and citrus pith make for an untypical opening. The soft palate follows with far more fruit than expected, underscored by a dollop of sweetness that brings out perfumed apricot and ripe, yellow peach. The depth of fruit and its purity is beguiling, like a cloud of juicy, generous ripeness."
US,91.0,55.0,Napa Valley,Sequum,"A bright, floral violet bouquet invites in this blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah that follows through with earthy cherry and strawberry highlights. Softly textured, the wine is deeply structured and in balance, a delicious offering of several varieties married well."
France,90.0,55.0,Saint-Ãmilion,ChÃ¢teau Pavie Macquin,"The wine has developed well, with plenty of weight, but the fruit seems a little diffuse, soft, open in character. It's masking the tannin core, a wine that opens slowly and carefully."
US,87.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Tobacco Road,"Jammy vanilla and leather mark this lean, mouth-filling wine that's had considerable time in bottle. Broad-shouldered in blackberry, it finishes with a burst of fruit and oak."
Italy,87.0,46.0,Bolgheri,Podere Prospero,"Made of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this has black-skinned fruit, game and scorched earth aromas. The dense palate delivers ripe black plum, toast and tobacco, its assertive tannins lending a rather astringent finish."
France,94.0,56.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau du CÃ¨dre,"The top wine of ChÃ¢teau du CÃ¨dre is beautifully balanced, its chewy tannins given the right perspective by the impressively dark fruits. The wine is brooding, profound, concentrated and complex. Age for at least 6 years."
US,86.0,15.0,Central Coast,Firestone,"Bright smells of freshly shredded lemongrass and orange blossom lift off of this Riesling that gets an aromatic boost from 11% GewÃ¼rztraminer. On the palate, it is smooth but slightly sweet, with orange soda flavors and a nice herbal twist of chamomile tea."
Spain,89.0,18.0,Cava,Castellroig,"Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana. Nothing about this is overwhelming, but the sum of its parts add up."
Italy,92.0,55.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Collosorbo,"Chopped mint, new leather, forest floor and spiced plum aromas take shape in the glass. The ripe, juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry jam, clove and licorice notes, supported by big, rounded tannins. It's already accessible and seriously delicious. Drink through 2022."
US,86.0,36.0,California,Longevity,"This wine brings obvious fruit flavor that is ripe to overripe, good acidity and a nicely gripping texture. It tastes a bit earthy and woody and seems to be plenty mature."
US,88.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Nefarious,"Lightly volatile aromas are followed by focused cherry and spice flavors that linger. There are good things going on here, but the aromas provide distraction."
Italy,90.0,54.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,San Rustico,"San Rustico consistently makes some of the best Amarone available in the United States market. This shows fine qualities of blackberry, chocolate and tobacco, and a polished, silky mouthfeel."
France,85.0,15.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,Closerie du Bailli,"Very fruity, this is a ripe Merlot-dominated rosÃ© with some Cabernet Franc. It is rounded, smooth, soft at the end with bright and crisp acidity. Wild strawberries and a rich aftertaste give extra weight."
US,90.0,42.0,Mendocino,Alder Springs,"Lots of sweet berry flavors and equally large doses of fine-grained tannins are the opposite poles in this full-bodied blend. It smells like boysenberry and blackberry jam, with similar fruit notes on the palate. Then very firm tannins kick in, making the texture at once blanketing and a bit drying. This has so much flavor that time in the bottle will tame some of those tannins and leave plenty of character to enjoy. Best after 2019."
France,92.0,22.0,Sancerre,Henri Bourgeois,"An intensely mineral expression of Sauvignon Blanc, crisp, full of citrus flavors, deliciously fresh, but also complex. The wine is concentrated into a steel spring of ripeness, ready to burst from the glass."
Australia,90.0,50.0,South Australia,Penfolds,"This full-bodied Shiraz comes out of the chute a bit tarry and reductive, but opens up to show complex aromas of grilled meat, cola and espresso, with flavors of coffee and black olives. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins, but still may not be the longest-lived vintage. Drink now or cellar through 2015."
US,89.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,David Hill,"David Hill's 2006 Pinot Noirs are a clear step up from earlier vintages. This Barrel Select bottling, done in a fairly light, rather delicate style, offers lovely texture and balance, with ripe flavors of strawberry, brandied cherries and baker's chocolate. Suggestions of earth and iron filings add interest and weight to the finish."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Cava,Marques de Monistrol,"Opens with aromas of mustard and rye seed. The palate is soft, clunky and a bit cloying, with sweet, gummy, muddled apple and candied mango flavors. Finishes confected, with a tropical leaning. Not the best style for Cava."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Finca Constancia,"Despite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now."
Spain,82.0,12.0,Montsant,Cellers Baronia del Montsant,"Briny, rubbery aromas turn gamy and horsey in short time. This varietal Garnacha feels raw and low on body. Salty, herbal tomato and red-plum flavors finish with a flavor akin to Mexican salsa."
Argentina,93.0,25.0,Mendoza,Mascota,"Deep and lush up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cab Franc offers highly appealing aromas of blackberry and toast. Dense, layered and hefty on the palate, this extracted but well-balanced blend piles on blueberry, black plum, cassis and toast flavors. On the finish, darker notes of espresso and bitter chocolate take over. Drink now through 2018."
Italy,88.0,60.0,Recioto della Valpolicella Classico,Speri,"A touch of dried apple skin and cinnamon stick open the nose of this hearty, red dessert wine. It presents tight tannins, with a sweet, chewy chocolate aftertaste."
US,85.0,15.0,Willamette Valley,Cottonwood Winery of Oregon,"Fruity and round, with apple and banana flavors, this simple, easy-drinking wine enters and leaves softly all the way."
US,86.0,60.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Ridge,"A good Chardonnay that offers plenty of tropical fruit, pear and sweet, smoky oak flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. But Ridge hasn't been known as a source of great Chardonnay for years, and this '08 doesn't change that. It's seriously overpriced."
France,92.0,50.0,Savigny-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Domaine Antonin Guyon,"The juiciness of this wine, made by a producer based in Savigny, is what makes it so good. It is so fruity, with the tannins really only in a supporting role. That means it will develop quickly with the typical Savigny generosity. There is an attractive sprinkling of spice at the end. Drink from 2020."
France,85.0,14.0,Bordeaux,Calvet,"This ripe, rich wine has solid tannins and still-young blackberry fruit. Although a basic Bordeaux, it is extra rich and extracted and, surprisingly, needs to age. Drink from 2019."
US,85.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cana's Feast,"Dried herb, tobacco, plum and woodspice aromas are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors that have a lick of dry tannins behind them. There's plenty of interest but this wine needs food to combat the tannins."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Lauren Ashton Cellars,"It's rare to see an offering of this variety in Washington. This one comes from Lonesome Springs Vineyard. Aromas are initially so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of lemon zest and herb. The palate is medium bodied, with stone-fruit flavors that provide appeal."
France,91.0,112.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"At the south end of Chassagne-Montrachet, Morgeots Premier Cru is close to abbey ruins. This young, toasty wine is ripe, smooth and creamy. Rich apple and green plum flavors are balanced by acidity and touched by honey. The wood aging is still prominent and needs to tone down, so drink from 2018."
US,93.0,48.0,Fair Play,Baiocchi Wines,"Meaty, slightly earthy aromas are tempting, and the flavors expand with gobs of rich black plum and blackcurrant. This wine from a rising star in the Sierra Foothills has serious structure and full body, blanketed in fine tannins and encouraging the flavors to linger on the finish. Drink after 2018."
US,84.0,22.0,Ancient Lakes,Voila!,The aromas of guava and other tropical fruits are faint while the flavors seem washed out. There's enjoyment to be had but it all needs to be dialed up.
France,89.0,72.0,CÃ´te RÃ´tie,Maison Nicolas Perrin,"This joint venture between Nicolas Jaboulet and the Perrin family is turning out some good examples from the Northern RhÃ´ne, like this CÃ´te RÃ´tie, which is plummy, yet at the same time loaded with savory notes of cured meat and smoke, even a hint of bacon fat. Silky tannins frame the finish. Drink now??017."
France,88.0,25.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,Francis Blanchet,"Crisp with apples and citrus, it's also laced with a more mineral character. It's full in the mouth, very bright with acidity and grapefruit. Drink now."
Spain,83.0,17.0,Ribera del Duero,El Arte de Vivir,"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day."
US,91.0,52.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"The east side of the Russian River is home to some of the winery's best vineyards, and this wine exhibits the excellent structure, nerve and ripeness of all of their 2011 Pinots. It's forward but nuanced. Drink now??017."
US,87.0,38.0,Amador County,Yorba,"Aromatically this wine offers a lot of pleasant things, from anise and violet to pretty dark cherry and blackberry fruit. The tannins are pronounced and leathery, the mouthfeel quite concentrated, making it a hearty wine that could take a little more time in bottle to come around. The 2009 is more accessible."
US,91.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"This wine surprises by being so very pretty?unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through."
Spain,92.0,75.0,Ribera del Duero,Alidis,"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years."
Canada,89.0,40.0,Okanagan Valley,Meyer Family Vineyards,"Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Toscana,Gualdo del Re,"This Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany offers up aromas of bell peppers, cedar wood and black currants. On the palate, this shows black cherry, raspberry and black pepper notes mingled with espresso. It finishes on a bitter note of unroasted coffee bean."
US,84.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Adelaida,"In warmer years this vineyard, in the far western part of Paso Robles, can produce splendid Pinot Noir. But 2011 was shockingly cold, and this wine suffered as a result. It has tart acidity and vegetal, mushroomy notes that the toasty oak can't cover."
France,88.0,18.0,Entre-Deux-Mers,ChÃ¢teau Landereau,"Situated on the ridge in the center of Entre-deux-Mers that produces fine white wines, this vineyard has produced a wine that is rich and full. Apricot and ripe pear fruits have a perfumed touch along with almond and spice flavors. It could do with a few more months and will be best from 2017."
US,87.0,20.0,Washington,Board Track Racer,"Forward and fruity, this is a tight, tart wine with a jumble of berry and bramble flavors. It's peppery, spicy, but don't look for too much complexity. Gulp it down for the enjoyable quaffer that it's meant to be."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,Umani Ronchi,"Umani Ronchi makes some of the best Verdicchio you will find in the United States today. There's a sweet candied quality to the bouquet that is followed by ripe fruit and pineapple. In the mouth, the wine is smooth and silky."
US,89.0,23.0,Yolo County,Berryessa Gap,"A chalky, mineral aroma leads to lively green apple and dried herb flavors. This wine is light-bodied and subdued but has enjoyable, savory flavors to complement its moderate fruitiness and an easy elegance that separates it from the pack."
France,88.0,40.0,Auxey-Duresses,LabourÃ©-Roi,"The small village of Auxey-Duresses is well known for its attractive, cool and fruity whites. This bottling is only lightly oaked, showing plenty of fine acidity and a crisp, clean texture. Not a wine for aging, drink now for its tangy character and bright aftertaste."
US,92.0,48.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Big Basin,"Aromas steadily emerge on this bottling of mountaintop grapes, with golden apple oil, condensed honeysuckles, lemon bars and dried mango slices showing the slightest hint of tropicality. The palate is equally deep, with soft white peach sliding into sea salt, dried apples and nut oil, all culminating in a warm, lengthy browned-butter finish."
US,89.0,21.0,Seneca Lake,Bellangelo,"Immaculate freshness abounds in this zesty Chardonnay. While supple and quite creamy on the palate, pristine lemon and pear flavors and a vibrant backdrop of lemony acidity invigorate. Elegantly meshed vanilla and spice tones linger on the finish."
France,86.0,30.0,Bourgueil,Domaine les Pins,"Stalky and tannic, this wine's structure is balanced by red berry-fruit flavors. It is smoky, typical of Cabernet Franc, giving a young character that should broaden out. Drink this fruity while structured wine now, or better from 2016."
Australia,94.0,70.0,McLaren Vale,Kilikanoon,"Big and bold, with firm tannins, this powerful Shiraz shows all the ingredients that point to excellent aging potential. Hints of toast and cracked pepper accent dark-berry aromas, while the flavors mix ripe fruit and intriguing spice notes. The finish is marked by espresso, firm tannins and terrific length. Drink 2020??030."
France,84.0,10.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau des Arnauds,"This vivid pink-colored wine, 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, is soft, with gentle fruitiness and crisp edge. Acidity and a herbal edge add a more textured character. Drink now."
Argentina,85.0,15.0,Salta,Anko,"Powdery, soapy aromas are exotic but not fully convincing. Fresh but nothing more than wet and basic on the palate, this shows briny flavors of orange rind through the finish."
US,93.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Gorman,"Big, round and lush, this is the fourth vintage for this wine, one of the best Chardonnays in Washington state. In this vintage it did not go through full malolactic, leaving a nice underlying acidity with a leesy, creamy freshness. Golden apples, stone fruits and a lick of butterscotch add to the luscious, generous finish."
US,90.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ocelli,"This wine brings vibrant aromas of dried orange peel, raspberry, umami and potpourri. The flavors are medium bodied, fresh and pure, showing no new oak influence."
France,88.0,29.0,Champagne,Pannier,"There's a lot of richness in this wine, which has a pale pink color. You can smell fresh strawberries as well as a yeasty note and something earthy and mulchy. It drinks quite dry and crisp, with a real bite of acidity and some pretty raspberry flavors. It turns rich and complex on the finish."
Italy,85.0,23.0,Soave,Vicentini Agostino,"This simple, everyday white offers subdued aromas suggesting peach and citrus that carry over to the shy palate. Bright acidity lends a tangy finish."
Italy,90.0,25.0,Alto Adige Valle Isarco,Abbazia di Novacella,"Aromas of wild herb, citrus, flint and orchard fruit lead the nose on this polished white. The bright palate offers up Bosc pear, sage, energizing mineral and a note of lemon zest. It's well balanced, with crisp acidity."
US,84.0,37.0,Red Mountain,Page Cellars,"Using grapes sourced from a Red Mountain vineyard, this pure Cabernet seems to have been overripened. Notes of raisin and prune appear on the nose and palate, and the mouthfeel is chalky and a bit flat."
France,89.0,39.0,CÃ´te de Nuits-Villages,Maison Ambroise,"Rounded and ripe, it has tannins nicely embedded in the red plum and strawberry flavors. It's full-bodied and already showing a delicious, seductive side. Drink from 2016."
US,91.0,50.0,Amador County,Renwood,"A firm texture, ripe flavors and good sense of balance help put this wine on an equal footing with very good wines from other grape varieties. Juicy blackberry meets dark chocolate on the palate and both linger on the finish."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Soave Classico,PrÃ ,"Fresh citrus and stone fruit give this Soave Classico a very bright and lively feel. It's an easy, food-freindly wine produced in the informal but cheerful style that characterizes this white wine region in northern Italy."
France,89.0,25.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Tanesse,"New-wood flavors abound in this firmly structured, dry wine. With its tannins at the fore, plus its heavy toast and sweet-tasting black-fruit flavors, it has weight and density. This is likely to age well over 3?? years."
US,89.0,50.0,McMinnville,Youngberg Hill Vineyards,"This single-block bottling, though tasty, is a less complete wine than the CuvÃ©e. Here the bright raspberry fruit is tight and constrained a bit, with an abundance of tart acids. Just a light hint of chocolate comes up in the finish."
Argentina,83.0,9.0,Mendoza,Espiritu de Argentina,"Chunky and generic smelling, with a nutty, oily palate that isn't purely focused or clean. The palate has some bitterness and excess weight along with fading lychee and melon flavors. Not a terrible wine for $9 but the low price doesn't erase its flaws."
Spain,84.0,14.0,Cava,Paul Cheneau,"Initial bready aromas settle on sweet apple. In the mouth, this has a confected feel balanced by acidity. Flavors run short and candied, with accents of peach and lychee, while a melony, sugary tasting finish is saved by lasting acidity."
France,88.0,10.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Grand Marchand,"This dense and solid wine comes from the eastern ends of the Entre-deux-Mers. It is full of black fruits that balance the firm, dry tannins. Juicy acidity bursts in at the end for a wine that's already delicious and will age well. Best to drink from 2017."
France,90.0,55.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Clos de L'Oratoire des Papes,"This bottling from the large nÃ©gociant Ogier features attractive aromas of black olives and ripe cherries. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, with flavors of mocha, olive and dark earth that finish warm and long. Drink now??020."
France,93.0,75.0,Vosne-RomanÃ©e,Alex Gambal,"From vines more than 50 years old, this is a full-throated, concentrated wine. Solid tannins and rich black fruits combine with structure and a sweet, ripe aftertaste. The acidity at the end gives just the right lift. Drink this powerful wine from 2017."
US,92.0,60.0,Paso Robles,The Farm Winery,"This is a huge, complex wine, filled with currant, cocoa and dried herb flavors wrapped into dusty tannins. It's dry, elegant and even ageworthy. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime juice that makes the dark fruit dance. Drink now??017."
France,90.0,26.0,Tavel,Domaine de la MordorÃ©e,"Despite Christophe Delorme's untimely passing before the 2015 harvest, this Tavel stands as a fine testament to his family's perseverance. It's full, round and rich, with cherry-berry fruit and hints of peach and crushed stone. Drink it over the rest of 2017."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Saintongey,"Ripe fruit and balanced acidity allow this wine to make room for touches of wood aging. It has spice, a smoky character and attractive finishing freshness. Drink from 2017 when the wine will be fully balanced."
US,89.0,39.0,Chalone,Michaud,"Light honey and apple-syrup aromas meet with hints of marzipan and sweet pear on the nose of this bottling. The flavor profile is intriguing and slightly bitter, with quinine, orange oil, citrus zest and sandstone presented on a oily structure."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Romagna,TrerÃ¨,"Made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, underbrush and bell pepper. The straightforward palate shows black plum, tobacco and baking spice alongside round tannins. Drink soon."
Spain,90.0,22.0,RÃ­as Baixas,As Laxas,"Light in color and mellow on the nose, with leesy notes, this always-reliable AlbariÃ±o is fresh and kicking with acidity. Apple and peach flavors carry over to a plump finish with lasting stone-fruit and melon notes."
US,88.0,20.0,California,Kunde,"Toasty, smoky aromas from new oak come close to concealing shy apples and citrus fruits, but the strong spicy flavors assert themselves on the palate. A very long finish completes the picture."
Italy,85.0,14.0,Chianti Classico,La Castellina,Here's an easy wine that opens with bright berry aromas of raspberry and blueberry backed by slight tones of almond nut and cola. Pair it with cheesy pasta or pizza.
US,88.0,24.0,Dry Creek Valley,C R Graybehl,"Waxy in mouthfeel and dark gold in color, this wine offers simple fresh lemon and green apple flavors, its finish expansive and full."
US,88.0,14.0,Monterey County,Irony,"Quite light in the glass, this bottling immediately shows a stony minerality on the nose as well as touches of sea salt, baked apple and nectarine. The palate pops with a savory, briny character, giving depth to the pear, Gravenstein apple and caramel flavors."
France,85.0,11.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Georges Vigouroux,"This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now."
US,90.0,28.0,Livermore Valley,Rubino Estates Winery,"Aromas like new leather, tobacco and spices lead to vivid cranberry and raspberry flavors in this lively, fine-textured, authentic-tasting wine. It has a medium to light color, medium body, firm tannins and a great mouthwatering character partly because of its relative leanness."
Italy,86.0,11.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico,Cantina Ma.Ri.Ca.,"This charming wine opens with an alluring floral fragrance of Spanish broom and hawthorne. The palate delivers flavors of juicy peach and lemon zest, with a savory salinity that recalls the seaside. Pair this with pasta topped with clam sauce."
France,84.0,10.0,MÃ¢con-Villages,Cave de Lugny,"A very soft, fruity wine, with a gentle, creamy texture and light acidity. It's fresh with vanilla and pear flavors, and ready to drink."
Spain,92.0,90.0,Priorat,Marco Abella,"This ripe Carignan-Garnacha from a warm year smells of prune, vanilla, cola and violet petals. The palate is open and wide, with raw tannins and a sensation of resiny oak. Flavors of black plum, red and black currants, toast and barrel spice finish toasty, chocolaty and much like coffee, with tannic grab and just enough acidity to keep things lively. Drink through 2024."
US,94.0,48.0,Adelaida District,Paix Sur Terre,"Brooding and powerful, this ripe and regionally representative blend of 85% Syrah and 15% MourvÃ¨dre shows caramelized blueberry, chocolate sauce, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and coffee bean on the nose. It hits the palate with density that masks the fruit at first, and then unleashes waves of fudge, elderberry, blackberry, licorice and jet-black coffee laced with black cassis."
Spain,89.0,22.0,Rioja,Covila,"Earthy, lightly baked cassis and raspberry aromas come with a dose of oaky vanilla. A full, bright, healthy palate delivers baked berry and cocoa flavors in front of a solid finish with molasses, vanilla and raspberry notes. Drink this mature Rioja now."
US,87.0,35.0,Colorado,The Infinite Monkey Theorem,"Blueberry sauce and toasted vanilla notes are mild on the nose, with crushed blackberries and black pepper gracing the palate. Ample body and silk tannins make this Syrah approachable, easy and perfect for backyard barbeques."
US,91.0,60.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),K Vintners,"MourvÃ¨dre (47%) and Grenache (37%) are in the lead on this wine with the balance Syrah, Counoise and Picpoul. The aromas of red and black fruit, brown stems, green olive, coffee and spice are initially faint while the tart red-fruit flavors bring a sense of delicacy and restraint."
Italy,85.0,11.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,"Sushi, fried calamari, grilled vegetables or barbecued shrimp would all make perfect companions to this fresh, easy Sicilian white wine. It ends with citrus, lime and herbal aromas."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Sicilia,Colosi,"This opens with pretty fruit tones of cherry and blackberry, with subtle tones of spice and rum cake in the background."
US,90.0,50.0,St. Helena,Trinchero,"This is a thick, chocolatey wine with a side of leather and black pepper that appeals on multiple levels. Full-bodied concentration gives way to a smooth, rounded palate robust in blackberry and vanilla."
US,88.0,32.0,Yountville,Tamber Bey,"Full and weighty, this vineyard-designate is salty and floral, offering whiffs of orange blossom around lime zest and brine. The minerality shines through despite the size, making for a food-friendly, yet hedonistic wine."
US,89.0,18.0,Lake Chelan,Tildio,"Drier than the 2008 at just under 1% residual sugar, this offers lime-driven citrus fruit flavors, wrapped in puckery acidity. It opens with pleasing aromas of blossom and sweet pea, and has the grip and finish of some Austrian or German trocken-style Rieslings. It would be interesting to cellar it for 6?? years, but it's drinking well already."
US,86.0,25.0,Carneros,Peter Cellars,"Pinkish-gold in color, this is a faint, dry and herbal rosÃ© that's pungent in fuzzy stone fruit such as peach and apricot. Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, it's light and bright, with a finish of tart grapefruit."
US,88.0,19.0,Russian River Valley,Balletto,"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length."
Australia,89.0,17.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"This is medium to full in body and rounded in the mouth, with loads of yellow plum and ripe pineapple flavors. It's not the most complex wine, but offers a satisfying mouthful of fruit and solid length. Drink now."
US,80.0,36.0,Central Coast,Jack Creek,"Tasted in early February, this Chardonnay had some secondary fermentation in the bottle, giving it a bubbly feeling. This major flaw may disappear in time."
US,92.0,58.0,Edna Valley,Talley,"From a vineyard owned by Talley but shared in equal parts with two other wineries, this bottling is snappy on the nose with black raspberry, graphite, sweet juniper and rose hip aromas. On the palate, it's light in body and lively with acidic energy, offering raspberry, tart plum skin and sour cherry, inflected with anise spice. There is significant length to the mouthwatering finish."
France,92.0,60.0,Champagne,Le Brun de Neuville,"This producer's signature grape is Chardonnay and this Champagne with its tight, nervy and mineral character is a fitting emblem. It is crisp, with green-apple fruit and lively acidity. Underneath there is a structure that will allow the bottling to age further. Drink from 2018."
Italy,88.0,60.0,Barbaresco,Oddero,"Aromas of toast, sawdust, raspberry jam and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers cherry liqueur, espresso and a hint of licorice while close-grained tannins provide the framework."
US,90.0,18.0,Edna Valley,Verdad,"Oodles of fresh raspberries, cherries and spices in this zesty young blush wine. It's elaborately rich but oh, so dry and crisp. Just a delight, one of the best rosÃ©s of the vintage."
US,90.0,35.0,Finger Lakes,Heron Hill,"Big, bold fruit and penetrating tannins mark this lush, powerful Cabernet Franc. Rich black cherry and berry flavors penetrate the palate, layered in streaks of smoke, spice and cranberry acidity. It's a potent wine to mature till at least 2018."
US,90.0,49.0,Napa Valley,Napa Valley Cattle Company,"Almost instantly identifiable as a Napa Valley Cabernet for its classic black currant and cassis flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins, and finished with acidity. The fruit is ripe and sweet, with an edge of green olives, yet the finish is thoroughly dry, with a complex spiciness. Drink now through 2020."
Italy,89.0,70.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Rubinelli Vajol,"Aromas of toast, roasted coffee bean, ripe black skinned fruit and exotic spice lead the way on this forward, concentrated wine. The warm, dense palate offers blackberry jam, dried black cherry, roasted walnut and licorice while big, chewy tannins offers support."
Italy,96.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Il Colle,"Red berry, wild mint, crushed rose, forest floor and new leather are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant delicious red. Seamlessly boasting structure and finesse, the full-bodied palate displays layers of succulent morello cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cinnamon while firm velvety tannins lend support and a polished texture. A savory saline note wraps up the lingering finish. Drink 2018??026."
Italy,88.0,23.0,Puglia,La Corte,"Here is a dark and impenetrable Negroamaro with evident oak shadings that add spice, vanilla and toast to the natural cherry and plum. The wine is dark and meaty with a smooth disposition and chewy succulence."
Italy,85.0,11.0,Sicilia,Tasca d'Almerita,Here's a luminous and vibrant rosato from Sicily with a saturated pink color and thick aromas of ripe raspberry and forest fruit. It has good acidity and enough heft and density in the mouth to pair with pasta or fish soup.
US,85.0,15.0,California,A By Acacia,"This high-production Pinot shows good varietal flavors of red cherry candy, cola and spices. It feels common, with a simple finish."
Italy,89.0,29.0,Chianti Colli Senesi,Castel di Pugna,"Here's a blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo Nero and Ciliegiolo that opens with aromas of dark skinned fruit, underbrush and a whiff of leather. The easygoing palate delivers ripe Morello cherry, crushed black cherry, savory herb and a balsamic note alongside fresh acidity and smooth tannins. There's not a lot of complexity but it is delicious."
US,90.0,45.0,Columbia Valley (WA),William Church,"Opening aromas of fresh, high-toned herbs and spice are followed by plentiful dark plum and cherry flavors that show elegance and persistence. It doesn't always seem varietal but provides a lot of enjoyment."
US,94.0,105.0,St. Helena,Revana,"There's a spicy quality to the aroma of this polished Cab, with suggestions of dill, sage, crushed autumn leaves and even ProvenÃ§al lavender and thyme. It's a unique interpretation of Napa and must come from the vineyard's terroir. In the mouth, notes of herbs and tobacco lead to more savory sweet cherry, currant and vanilla oak flavors. This interesting, even dramatic Cab should develop over the next decade."
US,91.0,22.0,Santa Maria Valley,Cambria,"This wine offers caramelized apple, seared pear, honeysuckle, a touch of buttercream and vanilla ice cream on the even, well-measured nose. The flavors lean more green but not underripe, with lime juice, green apple and green mango, offering some bitterness and an alkaline/iodine character."
Canada,87.0,32.0,Okanagan Valley,Tinhorn Creek,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 28% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc, 41% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Petit Verdot. Sweet scents of cracker open into a wine with pretty red plum and details of coffee and chocolate. It does not in any way reflect the rather high-listed alcohol, but seems more elegant and lightly refined."
France,90.0,40.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,ChÃ¢teau d'Or et de Gueules,"Something different, the fruit for this wine comes off 80-year-old Carignan vines. The result is an intensely concentrated wine that mixes raspberry and blueberry fruit with delicate herbal shadings. It's full-bodied, but supple and easy to drink, ending on a note of dark chocolate. Drink now??018."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Cerasuolo di Vittoria,Valle dell'Acate,Nero d'Avola and Frappato are blended to create a light and fragrant wine with pretty layers of berry fruit and almond paste. It's an easy and fresh wine that works well for everyday consumption.
US,91.0,50.0,Carneros,Hartford,"Toastier and smokier than the other bottlings, with clove and coffee accents dressing up sturdy plum and earth flavors. Finishes long, with hints of tart plum skin and dusty tannins. Seems as if rare duck breast would be a perfect match."
US,88.0,24.0,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Watermill,"This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of coffee, green herbs, pencil lead and vanilla followed by silky cherry and dark chocolate flavors. There's plenty of appeal but the variety seems to get lost."
France,94.0,40.0,CÃ´te RÃ´tie,E. Guigal,"The perfect combination of elegance and purity of fruit give this famous wine, a blend of fruit from both slopes of the hills above Ampuis, a great sense of style as well as power. The Syrah perfumes, at their richest and coolest, combine with black fruits to give an overwhelming impression of immense fruit flavors."
US,85.0,13.0,Rattlesnake Hills,Hyatt,"Coming in at 47g/L residual sugar, this is quite ripe and aromatic with notes of peach and flowers but doesn't have the acid to hold it together."
US,83.0,22.0,El Dorado,Lava Cap,"Simple and jammy, this Zin shows fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and oranges. It's a little sugary sweet."
US,93.0,225.0,Oakville,Continuum,"This estate red is named after its mountainous locale?a brambly vineyard on Pritchard Hill above Oakville. It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes. Soft, pliable tannins add weight and texture. More time in bottle should add nuance; enjoy 2024??034."
Italy,91.0,35.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Boscarelli,"Underbrush, leather, spice and savory herb aromas lead the nose. The smooth palate offers juicy dark cherry, mint, tobacco and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2018."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Collio,Pighin,"This opens with scents that recall elderflower, white stone fruit and a whiff of yellow pepper. The linear palate offers white peach, grapefruit and tart gooseberry brightened by racy acidity."
US,87.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Brookman,"Ultra-ripe, this Cab is decadently tasty, but not really dry. It's almost as gooey soft and sweet as a dessert pastry, with flavors of pie crust, chocolate pudding, sweet blackberry jam, currants and licorice. Drink now."
US,88.0,28.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"Rich caramel and a substantive presence of oak overlay an otherwise fairly light-bodied, structured wine from an estate vineyard. It's packed in tropical elements and baked apple."
US,91.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Peachy Canyon,"Concentrated strawberry, black cherry, cinnamon-laced latte, licorice and mocha converge in an intriguing and beautiful nose from this legendary Zin winery. The structure is immediately apparent on the palate, framing smoked strawberry, oregano and dill flavors. It's full of plush, ripe fruit, but seemingly bone dry."
US,89.0,30.0,Yakima Valley,:Nota Bene,"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard."
US,85.0,42.0,Napa Valley,Lawer,"This is direct and a bit hot in alcohol, with jammy berry, cherry, currant and oak flavors. It offers good Cabernet pleasure in an everyday sort of way."
Italy,83.0,16.0,Puglia,Fatalone,"The expression of this wine is so light that it could probably be classified as a rosÃ©, though its label does not describe it as such. Made using organically-farmed fruit, it shows bright berry and white cherry flavors, with crisp acidity."
Italy,93.0,104.0,Barolo,Michele Chiarlo,"This beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from the Cannubi cru opens with elegant and defined aromas of forest fruit, white chocolate, drying minerals, violets and moderate, spicy barbecue-like aromas. The wine shows excellent structure and tight, drying tannins that need 5?? more years of cellar aging."
Italy,86.0,18.0,Friuli Grave,Piera Martellozzo,"This blend of Merlot and Cabernet has aromas of bell pepper, black currant and a hint of cedar wood. The palate shows one-dimensional flavors of plum, black currant and oak."
US,90.0,27.0,Napa Valley,Lang & Reed,"This is the producer's inaugural foray into the variety, sourced from the Oak Knoll area. The wine is inspired by the Loire Valley and its well-known Cabernet Franc. Coopered in French oak and stainless steel, it retains a subtle crispness and light body, the acidity supporting highlights of floral white fig, pear and honey."
US,92.0,68.0,Sonoma Coast,Red Car,"From a tiny, organically farmed vineyard outside of Occidental, this wine is dense in earth, with a brambly nose of wild cherry and cranberry. Salty and herbal, it retains plenty of acidity on the light-bodied palate, offering a mix of cinnamon and tangerine on the finish."
Spain,88.0,21.0,Ribera del Duero,Bodegas PeÃ±afiel,"Initial hickory and clove aromas give way to cool earth scents. This flush, tannic RDD is edgy and abrasive in feel, with baked plum and spicy berry flavors. On the finish, this tastes saucy and earthy, with mild astringency stemming from hard tannins."
US,86.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Saint Laurent,"Tart green apple fruit flavors dominate, with high acids and perhaps a hint of light toast. Simple and straightforward."
US,93.0,47.0,Russian River Valley,Carlisle,"From a ranch planted originally in 1926 this is a knockout wine, exotically spiced and nuanced in pepper, cinnamon and a distinction of sandalwood. High-toned fruit provides a lift to the lushness that wants to dominate, but never does, allowing the tangy orange and blackberry to speak quietly and clearly."
US,86.0,22.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"Sangiovese may be the hardest grape of all to get right. In Eberle's hands, it makes for a softly pleasant, lip-smackingly delicious wine of ease and comfort. Nothing Italian about it, but you'll like the cherry, berry, tobacco and spice flavors."
Italy,85.0,21.0,Greco di Tufo,Villa Matilde,"Sensations of white peach, apricot, citrus and mineral come alongside medicinal notes that leave a rather bitter taste."
Argentina,84.0,10.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Spice and dusty fruit aromas are equalized by saucy, funky, leafy notes. This is full in the mouth, with flavors of brown sugar, baking spices and baked cherry. This finishes with mild spice and oak flavors."
France,97.0,451.0,BÃ¢tard-Montrachet,Domaine Leflaive,"The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity."
US,87.0,16.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Patterson,"High-toned, with somewhat muted fruit ??waxy comes to mind ??yet with appealing softness and immediate drinkability. It's non-vintage, a blend of two Cabernets, Merlot and Syrah, streaked with vanilla."
France,93.0,60.0,Chablis,Jean-Marc Brocard,"This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching."
France,88.0,15.0,Cahors,Georges Vigouroux,"This is a full-bodied and soft wine. Full of juicy red fruit flavors and rounded tannins, it's fruity and ready to drink, with delicious acidity at the end."
Australia,87.0,15.0,Langhorne Creek,Zonte's Footstep,"Once thought to be AlbariÃ±o, this grape variety is actually native to France's Jura. In this example from South Australia, it's a lean, crisp white, with hints of pencil shavings that accent its grapefruity flavors. It's pretty, harmonious and a good all-around white for drinking over the next 6?? months."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Alto Adige,Erste Neue,"This 100% Schiava opens with aromas of woodland berry, rose petal and a whiff of underbrush. The palate delivers dried cherry and a hint of forest floor alongside bright acidity and soft tannins."
US,94.0,110.0,Napa Valley,World's End,"This wine is hugely robust in concentration and power, a study in mountain-grown brambly berry and serious tannin. Bark, pencil and a wealth of spiced plum form the core of its character, with secondary elements of cherry and cigar box coming into play over time. Enjoy best beginning in 2024 through 2034."
US,90.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Clos Pegase,"Tight red fruit and a solid whack of oak make for a fine wine. Tobacco mingles with coffee on the otherwise black-cherry and curranty palate. It's definitely clean and polished, and will drink well for the next three to five years."
US,90.0,28.0,Yakima Valley,McCrea,"A blend of Grenache, MourvÃ¨dre, Syrah and Counoise, this wine brings an intriguing assortment of red and blue jammy fruit, herbs, cranberry and peppery spices. Reflective of the warm vintage it comes from, it's ripe, full bodied and in a sweet spot. Drink now."
US,92.0,40.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Matias Wines,"Dark and concentrated pomegranate and rosebud aromas meet with juniper and sweet pine needle on the nose of this bottling. The attack is a clean and flavorful, mixing dried cranberry and tangy cherry with thyme, marjoram and peppercorn, culminating in a camphor-like finish."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Soave Classico,Montresor,"Aromas of acacia flower, broom and a toasted note lead the nose. The palate offers light oak, yellow apple and lemon drop alongside racy acidity."
Italy,92.0,83.0,Toscana,Argiano,"Argiano's Suolo is a true standout in the world of Tuscan Sangiovese. It achieves elegance, complexity and richness with bright cherry notes contrasted against sweet vanilla and spicy oak. The finish is long, smooth and persistent."
Italy,95.0,130.0,Barolo,Poderi Aldo Conterno,"Juicy black cherry, tobacco, leather, underbrush, licorice, menthol, mint and balsamic notes all come together on this powerfully structured wine. The succulent, ripe fruit is supported by a solid tannic backbone. It's already delicious but it's still compact and brooding so give it time to unwind. Drink after 2020??040."
US,86.0,35.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Hahn,"Lots of acidity in this Pinot, maybe too much, as it gives a sour edge to the sweet raspberries and cherries. The end result is candied cough drop. Decant before serving."
US,89.0,11.0,California,McManis,"An appetizing hickory-smoke aroma and bold fruit flavors make this one stand out, yet it doesn't go too far with the woody character. A hint of bacon blends well with the ripe blackberry flavors, and the rich texture and firm tannins make it a great wine to pair with big portions of protein."
France,92.0,40.0,Champagne,Fluteau,"This impressive Champagne is rich while tight and mineral-textured. Creamy and ripe, it balances the weight of Pinot Noir with the elegance of Chardonnay. The producer's location in the relatively warm Aube region gives its wines extra fullness. This one is just now ready to drink."
US,93.0,39.0,California,The Mountain Winery,"It's very good, with deep, delicious flavors of tropical fruits, minerals and vanilla, accented with elaborate oak and brightened with crisp acidity. Production was a low 223 cases, but it's worth a search."
France,89.0,15.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine de la SangliÃ¨re,"Totally fresh and fruity, the wine also shows a light touch of vanilla. It is deliciously packed with ripe fruits, as well as acidity and some structure. Drink now."
US,89.0,32.0,El Dorado,Skinner,"This distinctive wine is spicy and meaty in flavor and very firm in texture as lots of fine-grained tannins give it grip, and full body helps it flood the tongue and coat the sides of the mouth. Best after 2019."
Italy,93.0,57.0,Terre Siciliane,Passopisciaro,"Seductively rich and powerful but also refined, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, orange zest, exotic spice and leather. The firm, juicy palate delivers crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, mineral and pipe tobacco alongside polished tannins. Drink 2016??032."
US,93.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Syncline,"This blend is concentrated and meaty. It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the MourvÃ¨dre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah. Somehow winemaker James Mantone coaxes something akin to French garrigue out of the grapes as well, making this one of a handful of Washington RhÃ´nes that really capture those elusive French herbal highlights."
Italy,89.0,40.0,Barbaresco,Pasquale Pelissero,"You'll find earthy aromas of leather, truffle, violet, ripe black cherry and a funky whiff of game on this. The approachable palate offers fleshy dark cherry, cranberry, clove and a hint of licorice alongside firm but not very persistent tannins."
US,85.0,24.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Rancho Arroyo Grande,"You'll find strong flavors of grilled blackberries and black cherries, tobacco, unsweetened baker's chocolate and black pepper in this dry, tannic wine. Made from Syrah, MourvÃ¨dre and Counoise, it's rustic and high in alcohol. Makes you think of beef tacos."
France,86.0,20.0,Blaye CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Saint Urbain,"This is firm, with dense fruits and ripe tannins. It has concentration as well as plenty of red fruits. Drink this potentially rich wine from Alliance Bourg from 2018."
US,91.0,33.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Brian Carter Cellars,"This is Brian Carter's Southern RhÃ´ne-influenced blend. The 2009 is 53% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 18% MourvÃ¨dre, 4% Cinsault and 2% Counoise, sourced from seven different vineyards. It all comes into focus somehow, yielding a seductive wine with a gentle intensity. Tart red currant, pomegranate and raspberry flavors are lightly spicy and dusted with pretty herbs. ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Woodinville?"
France,89.0,20.0,Montravel,ChÃ¢teau Laulerie,"The Dubard family has produced a fine and ripe wine. Perfumed and with tropical fruit flavors it is a rich wine, packed with fruit and also finely textured. It has weight, yellow fruits and fine acidity. Drink from late 2017."
US,88.0,45.0,Sonoma Mountain,Argot,"Jammy, baked black cherry gives this wine a richness of flavor and texture, while cola and clove stand idly by in support. Lively acidity preserves a freshness on the palate."
US,88.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Markham,"A few years in the bottle have nicely mellowed this wine, giving it a soft, smooth mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherries, red and black, perfectly ripe, seasoned with cassis and smoky new oak. Dry and elegant, this Merlot should hold well for five years."
France,87.0,19.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Cave de RibeauvillÃ©,"Brilliant, fresh wine, very bright and crisp with an attractive touch of toast to go with the fragrant berry fruits. Elegant and light, it is a fine, refreshing CrÃ©mant."
Spain,87.0,12.0,Rueda,Hermanos Lurton,"The light apple and mild citrus aromas are nice. It feels fresh and medium in intensity, with notes of peach, apple, pear and citrus in equal, moderate doses. Short, lemony and fresh on the finish."
France,84.0,9.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Baron Gassier,"A light-bodied rosÃ© with plenty of freshness on the finish, this is very clean and fruity in a slightly confected style. The delicate strawberry and cherry flavors are pleasant enough. Best served well chilled."
Italy,88.0,125.0,Barolo,Borgogno,"Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, wild berry and a balsamic note take the lead. The palate offers juicy Morello cherry, black raspberry, licorice and sage alongside rather astringent tannins."
US,93.0,100.0,Willamette Valley,Nicolas-Jay,"A big, chunky tannic wine, loaded with black-cherry fruit. The structure is there to age awhile, and 15 months in 50% new French oak has added notes of coffee and dark chocolate. There's a hint of tar, and overall an impression of bridled power. Drink now through 2025."
US,87.0,20.0,Mendocino,Horse & Plow,"Subtle and steely, this Pinot Gris is crisp and lemony. It has plenty of citrus amidst a core of herbs and flowers. The grapes are sourced from the organic vineyards of Guinness McFadden in the Potter Valley area of Mendocino County."
US,92.0,30.0,San Luis Obispo County,Cutruzzola,"Notes of fresh honeysuckle, baking soda and shaved citron mix with tons of slate, gravel and wet rocks on the nose of this great bottling. There's the slightest touch of sweetness to the palate, where waves of vibrant acidity carry forth flavors of orange blossom and mandarin as well as a grapefruit peel twist. It's certainly drinkable now, but will mature and evolve well through 2034."
US,92.0,38.0,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Peachy Canyon,"A vintage leader in this Zin house's series of site studies, this shows rose petals, violets, black tobacco, crushed anise and black sage on the delicately complex nose. Presenting great tension between the tannins and acidity, the palate offers candied blackberries and red cherries, cut by spearmint and green tea."
US,85.0,28.0,Carneros,Verotto,"Good, if a bit heavy and dull. Tastes like an older wine, with soft cherry, cocoa, licorice, spice and dried fruit flavors. Drink now."
US,92.0,22.0,El Dorado,Lava Cap,"This wine beautifully blends vivid fruit, enticing spice and luxuriously creamy flavors that are concentrated, layered and complex. It pulls it all off gracefully due to underlying acidity that supports a lush texture and leads to a long finish."
Italy,87.0,17.0,Moscato d'Asti,Adriano Marco & Vittorio,"This expression beautifully showcases Moscato d'Asti's typical sweet, musky aroma, along with notes of peach, citrus, white flower and honey."
US,88.0,100.0,Willamette Valley,Amalie Robert,"Firm and tart, this is a rather light, earthy, herbal take on the grape. Its blueberry and blue plum suggestions are bound in an unyielding frame, with a whiff of rubber ball on the nose."
US,93.0,43.0,Napa Valley,Darioush,"You can taste the oak and lees influence in this rich, full-bodied Chardonnay. With a creamy mouthfeel, it gets serious on the midpalate, with flavors of buttery peach, orange and nectarine fruit. Outstanding and elegant."
US,87.0,13.0,Washington,Dusty Cellars,"Subdued stone-fruit, jasmine and white-flower aromas lead to off-dry fruit flavors. It goes down easy."
US,91.0,21.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Owen Roe,"This wine shows finesse, driven by its seamless mix of citrus, melon, peach and pear fruits. Immediately delicious, it actually improves by the second day, showing its perfect acid-to-fruit balance. Give it a light chill?not too much?and it's a perfect autumnal sipper."
US,91.0,48.0,Willamette Valley,Love & Squalor,"This displays the big, chunky, California-style fruit of the 2012 vintage. It's forward, ripe, lusciously fruity, with plums, cherries, orange peel and more. Highlights of cinnamon and chocolate add complexity to the finish. Drink now through 2020."
US,90.0,48.0,Willamette Valley,Archery Summit,"A fine, elegant Pinot Noir, still in its infancy, with bright cranberry and raspberry fruit taking center stage. A shimmering, vivid, youthful vitality elevates the fruit flavors, with juicy acidity and restrained oak influence. Though this is the least expensive wine in the Archery Summit portfolio, it may surprise those who cellar it. Some extra years in the bottle could bring out unsuspected depth and power."
Spain,90.0,22.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Paco & Lola,"Clean and crisp apricot, nectarine and green-melon aromas are typical for the variety. The solid, fresh palate is crystal clear, while flavors of peach and nectarine finish as smooth as glass."
Australia,89.0,15.0,Clare Valley,Long Flat,"Nearly a Best Buy, this Riesling offers early drinkability relative to many of its Clare cousins. Mixed citrus and crushed-stone aromas mark the nose, while the medium-bodied palate finishes long, with what seems to be a touch of sweetness. Drink now??010."
France,86.0,15.0,Beaujolais RosÃ©,Domaine des Nugues,"Light and fruity, this is full of refreshing red berry fruits, making this a clean, forward apÃ©ritif. It has fragrant acidity on the finish."
US,92.0,34.0,Monterey,Metz Road,"A smaller project from the Scheid family of wines, this single-vineyard expression offers a sanguine nose of blood, iodine, dirt, crushed violets and a touch of pungent juniper and pine. It's light and lithe on the palate, with pomegranate, cranberry and iron, proving to be a very fresh sipper."
US,90.0,16.0,Central Coast,McClean,"Compelling warm berry compote and orange rind aromas mark the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling, with dried fennel, cola and dill accents. The palate is as hearty as expected, with ripe blackberry, vanilla, rose petal and ginger snap flavors."
Italy,87.0,26.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Merotto,"Fresh, bright and super lively on the palate, this very attractive Prosecco Superiore would pair with bite-sized quiche with cheese and ham or mini-pizza appetizers. Citrus and green melon are backed by acidity and tight, steely perlage."
US,91.0,41.0,Finger Lakes,Damiani,"Dark, ripe and concentrated, this voluptuous red offers loads of Merlot's characteristically plush plum and cherry flavors. It's also a deeply nuanced wine with pretty violet and chocolate notes mingling into spicy licorice and graphite. Richly textured, yet neatly balanced, it's drinking beautifully now but should hold well over the next decade."
France,98.0,520.0,Champagne,Salon,"Salon's releases are rare and signify a great vintage?the last release was the 2002. Coming from grand cru vineyards in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this 2004 is complex and concentrated, capturing the essence of Chardonnay in Champagne. Intense minerality and ripe apple and citrus fruits accompany the purity and crisp texture that are part of its ability to age. The wine can continue for many years, certainly to 2025 and beyond."
France,86.0,19.0,CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau du Vallier,"As with other wines produced by the Dulon family, this suffers from too much oak. Here it shows in the wood acidity, the burnt character and the bitter coffee flavors. It's a shame because somewhere under there is fruit. A year or two more will help, so wait until 2018."
US,91.0,44.0,Marin County,Couloir,"Powerful, natural, uncomplicated grape aromas and flavors fuel this light-bodied but memorable wine. With each sip its depth, complexity and appeal improve. The density and intensity of the fruit flavors combine with very firm tannins and lively acidity to make it nervy and delicious. Best now through 2019."
US,88.0,32.0,Sonoma Coast,Portalupi,"Cherry liqueur akin to kirsch rises aromatically, along with a lavender perfume. Light and high-strung, this is a tightly wound wine, punched in acidity and savory tea. The finish displays bold swathes of oak."
US,83.0,25.0,California,Ambrose,"This is a sturdy, dry wine with hefty texture and straightforward, almost neutral flavors. It has an unusual salmon-amber color, light peach aromas and slightly earthy notes on the palate."
US,92.0,48.0,Santa Maria Valley,Riverbench,"Hay yellow in the glass, this rosÃ© isn't pink at all, but offers inviting aromas of seltzer, crushed chalk, light lemon peels and yellow apples. The palate is quite mellow, which is pleasing, showing flavors of cider apple, dough and grapefruit peel."
Spain,94.0,125.0,Ribera del Duero,Matarromera,"This is a deep, layered, tannic Tempranillo from an intense vintage. Its blackberry, black plum and cedar aromas are broad and lush. Chocolaty oak flavors enwrap its ripe blackberry fruit, remaining rich and long on the finish. Drink 2018??026."
France,87.0,11.0,CostiÃ¨res de NÃ®mes,ChÃ¢teau de Nages,"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre shows off delicate floral and herbal notes laced over a core of raspberry compote. It's slightly creamy in texture, showing supple tannins on the finish, where it picks up a hint of bay leaf. Ready to drink now."
US,90.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Faust,"This 100% Cabernet is tannic, acidic and dry, yet remarkably fruity as well. It shows a classic cool-climate Napa structure, with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. It's not yet ready to drink, so give it at least six years in the cellar, and possibly far longer."
US,90.0,39.0,Chalone,Michaud,"Clean and light aromas of apples, sharp nectarine, yellow lilies and crushed white rocks make for a compelling nose on this bottling. The palate is very high-toned on first sip, then opens up with flavors of seared lemon rinds, saffron, sea salt and a light custard."
US,87.0,35.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ampelos,"Still tannic and acidic after all these years, this dry Grenache offers a ripe heart of cherries and cherry liqueur. Earns a point or two for elegance. Drink now."
France,88.0,16.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine de MÃ©nard,The honeyed wine has just a touch of botrytis as evidenced by the dry edge to the apricot and marmalade flavors. There is plenty of delicious refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness of this poised and stylish wine. Drink late 2017.
Spain,92.0,77.0,MÃ¡laga,Jorge OrdÃ³Ã±ez & Co.,"Brownish orange in color, this shows apricot and mango aromas in front of a lush but balanced palate. Orange, mango and a touch of brown sugar fill out the flavor profile, while a smooth finish avoids stickiness by offering up bracing acidity."
France,90.0,33.0,MonthÃ©lie,Bouchard PÃ¨re & Fils,"An opulent style, where the tannins are subservient to the ripeness of the red cherry flavor. The acidity enhances the sweetness of the rich fruit, and the lively, vibrant texture comes sweeping right through to finish."
France,84.0,11.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Lucas Carton,"Leathery and earthy, with hints of cranberries and chocolate. It's medium bodied and supple enough to drink now, turning a bit tart on the finish."
US,90.0,42.0,Calistoga,Vermeil,"Zin hardly gets riper or fruitier than this. Blended with a little Petite Sirah, which accounts for the tannins and depth, it's jam-packed with wild berries, currants, licorice, cocoa, black pepper and sandalwood, while high alcohol gives it a rich, glycerine mouthfeel."
US,82.0,15.0,California,Seven Daughters,"This is a straightforward but simple wine. It's dry and crisp but a bit watery with lemon, lime and vanilla flavors."
US,88.0,56.0,Russian River Valley,Testarossa,"A little gritty in texture, and the rawness is compounded by black pepper tartness. Yet there's a huge, succulent core of black cherry fruit, and the wine is perfectly dry and acidic. An interesting Pinot, one to stash in the cellar and see what happens."
US,87.0,26.0,Paso Robles,Eberle,"Simple sweet apple and poached pear notes meet with a slight tonic and guava nectar on the nose of this bottling that blends the Four Lanterns and Mill Road vineyards. Yellow apple and Anjou pear pop on the palate that ends on a yellow-grapefruit-peel finish, altogether clean and crisp."
US,83.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Sonoma Collection,"This wine of unknown grape varieties shows a thread of sweet cola and vanilla throughout a larger tunnel of smoky char, remaining somewhat flat, bitter and simple on the palate."
Australia,89.0,31.0,Adelaide Hills,Shaw and Smith,"Complex aromas and flavors of blackberries, leather, roasted meat and coffee show plenty of class, and this wine appears to firm up in the glass, offering more structure than its initial suppleness and amplitude suggest. It may close up for a few years, so try it now, or hold and try it after 2012."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Chianti Classico,Rocca delle MacÃ¬e,"This bright, straightforward red offers aromas of wild berry, coffee and a whiff of tilled soil. On the soft, easy-drinking palate, notes of chopped sage and baking spice add interest to the red cherry core. Drink through 2016."
US,88.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Chateau Lafayette Reneau,"Pretty hibiscus nectar and lychee notes add an exotic twist to this dainty late-harvest Riesling. Light on its feet, it's deliciously juicy on the palate with showers of pink grapefruit and stone fruit. Finishes clean with a brisk, black tea note."
Italy,89.0,47.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Zanoni,"On the bold and powerful side, this deals lush flavors of dark chocolate, chewy cherry, leather, tobacco and barbecue smoke. Packed with intensity and soft richness, it also delivers a fine point of fresh acidity on the finish."
US,85.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Hearthstone,"Pretty good southern RhÃ´ne-style red blend, with rich cherry-berry, chocolate, spice and sandalwood flavors that finish dry and robust. Needs a juicy burger to cut through the tannins. Ready now."
US,92.0,29.0,Arroyo Seco,Mesa Del Sol,"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting."
US,90.0,52.0,Napa Valley,Paraduxx,"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Zin provides the fuel to power the wine, while Cab lends elegance and structure. The flavors are a composite of both grapes, explosive in blackberries, currants, mocha, pepper and charcuterie."
France,90.0,37.0,Chablis,Joseph Drouhin,"This is deliciously crisp and steely, with an apple flavor and the weight of citrus and grapefruit. It has a minerally, chalky feel, and then the wine rounds out, with crisp fruit on the finish."
US,89.0,45.0,Sonoma Valley,VJB,"VJB's estate Syrah, from Sonoma Valley, is vintage variable, and 2004 was kind to it. The grapes got quite ripe, so the wine, which is slightly hot, shows lush flavors of black and red currants, dates and figs, chocolate macaroons, anisette and peppery spices. Yet it maintains a balancing backbone of acids."
France,90.0,34.0,Sancerre,Michel Vattan,"Named after a parcel of vines, this youthful, fruity wine is on its way to being delicious. It has a proper steely character, shot through with acidity and minerality while the citrus character is strong and firm. Drink from 2015."
US,94.0,95.0,Willamette Valley,BergstrÃ¶m,"This succulent wine is saturated with rich citrus flavors. Grapefruit, lemon, lime and pineapple notes combine while its 18 months in barrel contributes a layer of buttery toast."
US,86.0,16.0,Clarksburg,Clarksburg Wine Company,"A Clarksburg Chenin that does its region proud, this is invitingly floral, with a thick, viscous imprint of pear and fig and just slightly sweet at 1.1% residual sugar."
US,93.0,44.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Big Basin,"From 35-year-old dry farmed wines (the oldest in Corralitos) and 30% whole cluster/wild yeast fermentation comes aromas of pine pitch and blackberry jelly. The flavors are driven by sagebrush against a backdrop of deep purple fruit, with distinctive notes of juniper and eucalyptus powering the flavors from front to back."
US,84.0,20.0,Monticello,Pollak,"This Pinot Gris has aromas of wax, red apple, underripe white peach and citrus. The white peach note becomes more dominant on the easygoing palate, and it leads to a mineral-like tang that lingers onto the slightly yeasty finish."
US,87.0,25.0,Russian River Valley,Friedeman,"Meaty and substantial on the palate, this wine comes from several vineyard sites and was fermented in stainless steel tanks. It has a juicy note of sweet, ripe red fruit that's inviting."
US,88.0,45.0,Sonoma Coast,Rubinna,"This wine offers baked flavors of red raspberry, black cherry and grapy plum. It finds its balance between juicy approachability and a swat of tannin that provides depth and body. It finishes ripe and with a suggestion of char."
US,90.0,40.0,Mendocino,McFadden,"Easy-drinking, rich and mouth-filling, this wine is a winner from start to finish. It has red cherry and dill aromas, ripe plum and cherry flavors and a supple texture. Light on tannin and full in body, it's generous and satisfying to drink."
France,89.0,19.0,Morgon,Vignerons de Bel Air,"Jammy fruits are still kept in check by the dry tannins that surround this wine. It has a firm structure, intense acidity and black plum-skin fruit flavors. It's a serious wine, solid and certainly needing to age. Drink from 2017."
Spain,87.0,65.0,Conca de BarberÃ ,Torres,"On the nose, this aging Chardonnay brings corn to mind. Its palate is neither exciting nor flawed, with melon and stone fruit flavors that are yeasty and short, finishing on a bready and slightly oxidized note. Not a great value for its price."
France,94.0,93.0,Beaune,Chanson PÃ¨re et Fils,"This is a generous wine, although one that will need some serious aging. It is rich in tannins and powered by a firm structure. The fruit offers the weight to counter the tannins. It just needs time. Drink from 2024."
Italy,92.0,30.0,Recioto di Soave,Sandro de Bruno,"Here's a lightly oak-aged Recioto di Soave that opens with an intensely golden color and beautiful aromas of raw honey, roasted almond and chestnut, backed by candied fruit and apricot."
France,83.0,13.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,Les Hauts de Lagarde,"This bright, pink-colored wine is full of caramel and vanilla flavors that give a fat, dull character to the taste. It is dry, touched by bitter almonds and with a sharp aftertaste of acidity."
Italy,87.0,15.0,Vermentino di Sardegna,Santa Maria La Palma,"I Papiri is a fresh and fragrant white, with bright aromas of citrus, cut grass and white peach. Pair it with any Mediterranean fish dish."
US,91.0,30.0,Livermore Valley,Murrieta's Well,"Seriously refreshing, this pink and copper-colored medium-bodied wine has dazzling citrus aromas, pink grapefruit and raspberry flavors and great acidity that wakes up the taste buds. Made from Grenache and Counoise grapes, it's just the thing for an alfresco lunch or to pour with appetizers before dinner."
Spain,86.0,11.0,Jumilla,Juan Gil,"Blackberry and herbal aromas vie with raw oak and heat on the bouquet of this chunky, jammy, slightly sloppy feeling Monastrell. Dark plum, blackberry and baking spice flavors veer in the direction of clove, and overall this shows itself to be far more oak-based than pure."
US,87.0,52.0,Paso Robles,LXV,"Cola, dark cherry and candied strawberry show on the nose of this blend of 33% Grenache, 34% Syrah and 33% Tempranillo. The palate offers root beer and cherry cola flavors, with ample amounts of anise, nutmeg and vanilla, its tannins needing time to soften."
US,89.0,65.0,McMinnville,Ken Wright,"Tasted along with a dozen other single vineyard selections from Ken Wright, this feels a bit thin, but only in relation to a portfolio of astonishing power and depth. Truffle, red berries and sharp acidity combine nicely, though the finish falls away rather quickly."
US,85.0,30.0,Mokelumne River,Macchia,"The ripest and strongest of the Lodi Native wines this year, this has raspberry and black pepper aromas tinged with dusty, earthy accents, and heavy flavors like stewed plums."
US,85.0,22.0,Edna Valley,Wolff,"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper."
US,87.0,11.0,California,McManis,"This very attractive, medium-bodied wine emphasizes fruit flavor and freshness along with a lively texture. The raspberry aromas and red cherry flavors offer plenty of interest, and the balance makes it quite appetizing."
US,86.0,60.0,Howell Mountain,La Jota Vineyard,"A good, sound Cabernet, well-made and clean, with proper varietal flavors of blackberries, cocoa and smoky new oak. Yet it's somewhat soft, with a jammy-candy taste, and seems to lack complexity. Could be going through an awkward phase."
US,88.0,17.0,Rogue Valley,RoxyAnn,"A RhÃ´ne-style blend of 65% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 5% Viognier, this was aged entirely in neutral oak, to its benefit. The aromas burst from the glass with fresh ground pepper in the lead, and the Syrah and Grenache seem in perfect balance, each enhancing the other. Vibrant tart cranberry fruit is matched to juicy acids and that ravishing pepper. Pepper steak anyone?"
US,89.0,14.0,Paso Robles,Clayhouse,"An extremely good deal, this wine will keep both neophytes and experts entertained, with aromas of black-plum jam, dark strawberries and graphite on the lively nose. The palate brings pungent blueberry and black cherry, along with crushed black-lava rocks and pencil shavings right down the middle."
US,94.0,60.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Bonaccorsi,"Delicate power?any oxymoron?would be a fitting way to describe this single-vineyard beauty, grown in the northern part of the appellation. There's a lightness to the mouthfeel, like cotton candy, but then the power kicks in, reminiscent of cherry reduction, anise, orange zest, herb tea, black pepper and clove-dominated Asian spices. There's even a hint of smoky chocolate. Best now through 2012."
France,94.0,42.0,Chablis,Domaine Pinson,"Structured and with a strongly crisp and textured character, this wine also has a touch of toast from wood aging. Ripe green and yellow fruits are part of the concentration and dense flavors. It is still young, so wait until 2018."
Argentina,92.0,90.0,Valle de Uco,ViÃ±a Cobos,"Earthy aromas of forest floor, mushroom and herbs share space with more typical blackberry, cassis and shoe polish scents. This is bold but mildly tartaric and scratchy in feel. Blackberry, coconut and vanilla flavors display the wine's core ripeness and oak content, while the finish is long and flavorful, with density and weight. Drink from winter 2016 through 2022."
US,87.0,45.0,Willamette Valley,Sweet Cheeks,"Full-bodied and forward, this offers fruit flavors of spiced cherry, along with a broad streak of vanilla. The tannins hit hard and carry a slightly charred, slightly bitter aftertaste."
US,91.0,52.0,Sonoma Coast,Keller,"This is an intensely earthy wine, showing a rich bouquet of rose garden, geranium and wild pine. Soft on the palate and supple in tannin, it retains a savory edge throughout, spicy in Asian five spice, nutmeg and orange peel."
Italy,84.0,20.0,Chianti Classico,Bindi Sergardi,"This wine has aromas of oak, red currants and roasted coffee bean. Oak dominates the palate, with toasted sensations and espresso taking center stage over the subdued red fruit sensation. Overall, this is dried up and tannic, closing on an astringent note of wood tannins. Veritas Imports, Tanaro River Imports, Crown."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Cava,Biutiful,"Green apple, citrus and distant celery aromas feed into a fresh, peppy, citrusy palate with tangerine, lime and pink grapefruit flavors. The finish is citrusy like the palate, meaning it's bright, juicy and dry."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore,Drei DonÃ  Tenuta La Palazza,There's a dark and masculine quality to this Sangiovese from Romagna that makes this wine perfect for pork or breaded veal. Dark cherry and prune are backed by bright acidity.
US,92.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),DeLille,"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is SÃ©millon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit?clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart?playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce. Who can argue with that? Editors' Choice."
US,89.0,100.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley Vineyards,"This limited cuvÃ©e is essentially an Elton vineyard reserve, given extra (80%) new oak from selected blocks. Juicy black cherry and dark chocolate flavors combine, with lively acidity underscoring the moderately long finish."
US,93.0,65.0,Chehalem Mountains,BergstrÃ¶m,"With its built-in ageability and instant flavor appeal, this bottling may be the favorite of all the 2010s from BergstrÃ¶m. It's complete and delicious, with muscle and depth?a mouth-pleasing mix of berry, cola, sandalwood and earth, plus exotic accents of incense and myrrh."
France,84.0,20.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau de ParenchÃ¨re,"Should Bordeaux be 14%? Maybe, but not this wine. It is too big, dry, tannin-dominated and heavy. There is way too much extraction, and it shows in the bitter character."
US,90.0,30.0,Sonoma Coast,Garnet,"This is a heady, seriously generous Pinot Noir from a coolish site in the Sonoma Coast AVA that clearly had a banner ripening year in 2012. The fruit is smoky and concentrated in dark berry and cherry, an intriguing bit of spearmint playing around in the background. Rodgers Creek is an estate vineyard for the brand, planted to Pommard clones. A steal at this price."
France,88.0,17.0,Cadillac CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau Baracan,"Although it seems lean at the moment, there is enough fruit in this wine produced by Eric Gonfrier to promise a good future. The texture is dense, packed with tannins as well as the fruit. Wait until 2019."
US,83.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Whitestone,"Soft and supple, this quite approachable wine has simple, lightly fruity flavors. It's generic, pleasant and ready to drink, with some milk chocolaty oak in the finish. Though it lists at 14.6% alcohol, it does not have commensurate weight or density of flavor."
Italy,89.0,75.0,Castel del Monte,Santa Lucia,"This wine is held back for eight years by the winery before it is released for sale. It's named after the Fibonacci numbers, or the so-called ?golden ratio??that appears repeatedly in nature, this is a soft, almost sweet wine, with aromas of cherry and ripe raspberry. The mouthfeel is plush and velvety."
US,89.0,26.0,Yakima Valley,Pomum,"Lees aromas are at the fore. The palate is thick in feel, showing a good sense of balance that intrigues."
US,87.0,40.0,Rogue Valley,Griffin Creek,"Thick and tannic, this wine, among all the single-varietal offerings from Griffin Creek, shows a bit more ripeness to the black, muscular fruits. It's dense in the mouth, with cassis, cocoa and coffee, bolstered with sharp, piercing acidity."
US,86.0,45.0,Santa Barbara County,Waltzing Bear,"Aged more than two years in 50% new French barrels, this wine smells and especially tastes too oaky, with caramel and toast notes that overwhelm the underlying wine. Below all that wood is a dry, crisp Pinot Noir with red currant flavors. Other wines sourced from this Santa Rita Hills vineyard have been outstanding."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Toro,Cyan,"This is heavy and raisiny, with ripe earth and mineral aromas that are suggestive of Port. It feels loaded and scratchy, with licorice, prune and pepper flavors that finish short and with some heat. A bullish style to drink now."
US,87.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle. It's extremely dry, with earthy, balsam and mushroom-inspired flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cola."
France,87.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,La Belle Collection,"Named after the French author who came from Provence, this wine is a bright, fruity style with pepper and caramel flavors. It has plenty of red fruits and attractive final acidity."
US,88.0,24.0,Santa Barbara County,Ojai,"What a surprise to find that this Riesling is bone dry. It boasts complex flavors of mineral, lime, Meyer lemon and orange zest, with fantastic acidity that awakens the palate and prepares it for food."
US,84.0,20.0,Dry Creek Valley,Frei Brothers,"The winemaker really squeezed out the cherries and boysenberries in this Merlot, making it super fruity. It's not especially complex, but it will appeal to fans of jammy wines."
US,87.0,25.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bontzu,"Aromas bring notes of beeswax, lees and lemon. The palate is medium bodied and creamy in feel, backed by zippy acidity. The variety isn't entirely distinct but, despite this, it delivers appeal."
US,89.0,65.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"Coming from the winery's young estate vineyard, this 100% varietal wine conveys aromas of coffee, braised green pepper and herbs along with bittersweet chocolate and mineral accents. The cherry and herb flavors show good weight and intensity, with the tart acids and grainy tannins bringing plenty of appeal. It needs significant time in the cellar to show its best. Enjoy after 2024."
US,89.0,35.0,Sonoma County,Mauritson,"Very rich in blackberries and cassis, with an herbal grounding of sage and tobacco and a dusting of freshly crushed black pepper. You'll find hard-edged tannins and some sharpness to the mouthfeel. A few years of aging are warranted, but this isn't a wine for the long haul. Decant if you drink it now."
US,90.0,43.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ryan Cochrane,"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan."
Italy,84.0,20.0,Sicilia,Di Giovanna,"Made with organically-farmed Viognier, this is a unique, slightly awkward white wine with muddled aromas of kiwi, green fruit, green leaf and wild caper. The mouthfeel is thin, compact and fresh."
France,87.0,14.0,Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau du Juge,"A rich, spicy wine that is full of black-currant fruits. It does have a lighter touch of acidity that is nicely integrated into the smoky texture and fine tannins. The wine is ready to drink."
Italy,86.0,13.0,Vigneti delle Dolomiti,Tolloy,Here's a fresh and easy Sauvignon Blanc that would pair with easy appetizers or a salad lunch. Crisp but simple aromas of citrus and green apple give the wine that food-friendly appeal.
Spain,89.0,25.0,Rioja,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos,"Probably the best wine from this producer that we've rated. It's meaty and rich, with mocha, crusty oak, aged cheese and kirsch aromas. The palate is juicy and balanced, with licorice, blackberry, blueberry and other dark, ripe flavors. Finishes lengthy and toasty, with some refinement. 1,500 cases made."
US,87.0,45.0,Carneros,Clos du Val,"Hard to say just why this Chard isn't better. It's nicely dry, with decent acidity, good oak and a mineral background to the citrus and peach flavors. There's just a heaviness that keeps the wine from getting airborne."
France,87.0,30.0,Chablis,William FÃ¨vre,"FÃ¨vre's basic Chablis still shows the quality of this producer, with its finely textured, fully ripe fruit layered with a strong citrus character. There is some toastiness, which adds complexity but certainly doesn't dominate the green plum fruit flavors and lively acidity."
US,89.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,Shared Notes,"A rare style of California white, this is made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, but is not labeled that way. Striking smoky, white-pepper aromas and aggressive dried herb flavors jangle with apparent oak character. The combination of sharp acidity and soothing body begins to come together on the finish. It needs time to mellow and may improve after 2015."
US,93.0,60.0,Napa County-Sonoma County,Pride Mountain,"Leathery on the tongue, this lovely Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, offers inviting notes of plum and cherry, completely juicy, around firm, strong tannins and balanced acidity. From two separate, rocky blocks on the winery property, this wine is concentrated and smooth. Enjoy through 2021??025."
Spain,95.0,200.0,Toro,Numanthia,"This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018."
US,90.0,180.0,Napa Valley,Jarvis,"This estate blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 26% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot is smoky and tart. Its robust underbelly of tannin and persistent charred oak notes frame a core of red currant and cranberry fruit, peppered with clove."
France,90.0,30.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Tracy,"From one of the oldest estates in Pouilly FumÃ©, this is an herbal and freshly grassy wine. Delicious apple is textured with minerality, salty character and intense, still-young acidity. It's ready to drink although it will be better from 2017."
US,91.0,50.0,Green Valley,Ziata,"From a great site in this cool appellation, this wine shines with a powerful grip of ripe cherry and strawberry fruit and earthy undertones of dried herb and cardamom cola. Layered and dense, it has a seductively smooth texture and bite of minerality."
Italy,86.0,45.0,Barolo,460 Casina Bric,"Aromas of chocolate, mocha and raisin lead the nose. The lean palate shows prune steeped in spirits, toast and a hint of cocoa alongside brisk acidity and raspy, almost gritty tannins that give this a rough finish."
US,89.0,22.0,Paso Robles,San Simeon,"White flowers and a red apple candy reveal themselves on the nose, but the strongest aromas convey a concentrated pear-peach perfume. The palate is dominated by apple at first, but grapefruit carries the midpalate and finish, which shows good acidity and a bit of grip as well."
Italy,87.0,38.0,Friuli,Dorigo,"This sparkling blend (50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) represents one of only a handful of barrel aged metodo classico wines from Friuli in northeast Italy. The wine's perlage is firm and steely and there are soft layers of toasted bread, stone fruit and honey at the back."
US,90.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Flowers,"Shy and reserved, this cool-climate wine opens coyly with a burst of spearmint on the nose, evolving into layers of flavor steeped in rhubarb, black cherry and tea. Soft and lilting, the wine's finish conjures thoughts of strawberry cream."
US,86.0,16.0,Paso Robles,Ancient Peaks,"Soft and voluptuous in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, very cinnamon-pepper spicy and a little sweet, this Zin brings to mind simple comfort foods, like chipped beef, corned beef hash, barbecued ribs, beef tacos and cheeseburgers."
Spain,85.0,17.0,RÃ­as Baixas,La CaÃ±a,"Dusty aromas of apple and vanilla break up fast as the wine shows oxidized notes. The palate feels narrow and lemony, while the flavor profile is one dimensional and settles on lemon and tart apple. On the finish, things turn stalky in flavor and acidic in feel."
Argentina,89.0,16.0,Mendoza,Maipe,"Clean, pure and uncomplicated on the nose, showing depth and clarity. Smells and tastes much like a good Malbec or Cabernet might; it's sweet and fruity, with black cherry, pastry, baking spices and a certain rubbery quality that seems to come with Bonarda. On the money for this variety."
Spain,88.0,15.0,Campo de Borja,Pagos del Moncayo,"A powerful specimen that plows straight ahead on the bouquet, dealing out whiffs of rubber, smoke and hickory along the way. Meaty feeling and deep, with roasted blackberry, woodspice and bitter chocolate flavors. Dark and chocolaty on the finish, with a note of bacon."
Italy,91.0,53.0,Toscana,Rocca delle MacÃ¬e,"As its brawny name suggests, Roccato (Sangiovese and Cabernet) is a thickly concentrated wine with powerful blasts of plum, dried herbs, mint candy, licorice and white talc powder. It's ripe and ready to drink now."
US,90.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Cobden Wini,"Floral in aroma, this was aged in one-third new French oak and left unfined and unfiltered. It offers tart cherry and wild strawberry notes in a light-toned, ripe package, the secondary characteristics herbal and earthy."
US,93.0,52.0,Napa Valley,6 North,"A blend of various vineyards, this is a seamless Cabernet, impossible to find any fault with. It's just perfect in structural integrity and sweet, oak-accented blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit. So delicious, you'll want to drink it now, and that's just fine."
Italy,88.0,20.0,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Rinaldi,"Plum, French oak, coffee, vanilla and Oriental spice aromas emerge in the glass. The concentrated palate offers mature black cherry, blackberry jam, vanilla and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins."
US,83.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Johan Vineyards,"Thin, dilute, with a minty, unripe character, and hard-as-nails tannins."
Spain,88.0,20.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Maior de Mendoza,"Straightforward white-fruit aromas of apple and peach are the greeting, which is followed by a leesy, creamy feeling palate with enough popping acidity to create proper balance. Flavors of citrus fruits, nectarine and lees finish tasty and bright."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Moscato d'Asti,Mongioia,"Enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, vanilla, and citrus zest give way to ripe flavors of juicy apricot, candied nectarine, pear and sage. Fresh acidity lifts the rich creamy palate. Made from 99-year-old vines, this shows surprising aging potential. Enjoy through 2021."
US,88.0,19.0,Mendocino County,Carol Shelton,"This is a rich and fruity wine with an easygoing, soft texture and lower alcohol than many. Flavors recall boysenberry syrup and strawberry jam, and the wine just seems to melt in the mouth."
Spain,90.0,30.0,Rioja,La Rioja Alta,"Dry, leathery, slightly nutty aromas are more earthy than fruity. This mature Rioja is fresh and light on the palate, with leafy, spicy flavors of plum, tobacco and wood grain. Spicy berry and cocoa flavors grace a fading finish. Drink now."
US,88.0,7.0,Yakima Valley,Kiona,"Delicate, elegant and floral, with light flavors of white peaches and citrus blossom carrying over to a lingering, nicely knit, stylish and elegant finish. Just 10% alcohol. Best Buy."
US,89.0,20.0,San Luis Obispo County,Whitcraft,"Wins the darkest wine of the decade award. Absolutely black, except for a gleam of purple at the edge. Smells big, deep and oaky, with berry and chocolate scents. In the mouth, similar to Cabernet, with blackberry flavors and rich, thick tannins. Interesting as an alternative-type wine, and an ager. An ancient grape from the north of Italy and Austria"
Spain,93.0,60.0,Toro,Numanthia,"Rooty blackberry, cassis, vanilla and cola aromas are vintage Numanthia. So is a saturated, tannic palate that's deep and dense. Baked blackberry is the lead flavor, and that's matched by espresso and chocolate. Heat and ruggedness need to be resolved on a rich, powerful, chocolaty tasting finish. Drink through 2020."
US,89.0,15.0,California,Rock Wall,"Rich blackberry and chocolate flavors, rounded tannins, good concentration and a velvety mouthfeel add up to a lot of pleasure in this full-bodied wine blended from Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,93.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,La Crema,"This wine is made in decent quantities, enough to hopefully find, and that's good news, given its quality for the price. Juicy, spicy and just the right amount of herbal, it has sizzling acidity that livens and refreshens the palate, dotted in chocolate-covered cherry, plum and clove."
Argentina,87.0,18.0,Tupungato,Domaine Jean Bousquet,"While this is a bit rustic and herbal on first take, with time it settles and improves. Aromas of tomato and berry fruits lead to a crisp, firm palate with earthy plum, black cherry and herbal flavors. A soft fade away with earthy, baked notes doesn't hurt."
Italy,85.0,35.0,Veneto,CarpenÃ¨ Malvolti,"Extremely fragrant and floral, this classic method sparkler delivers a full bouquet of jasmine, honeysuckle and chamomile. But the nose is not just floral: You'll get yellow fruit, peach, honey and a bit of apple pulp as well. The wine closes with a note of bitter almond."
Italy,90.0,40.0,Sicilia,Ceuso,"This ripe, sun-drenched blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers generous tones of leather, tobacco, licorice, cassis berry, dried hay and spice. It has thick, dark concentration and a long finish."
Spain,87.0,15.0,Rioja,Bodegas Bilbainas,"Sweet, jammy berry aromas are a nice opening. The wine is tight in the mouth, with smacking tannins that draw down red berry and herbal flavors. For the most part this is a complete, standard type of Rioja with juiciness and crisp acidity."
US,85.0,20.0,Contra Costa County,Hannah Nicole Vineyards,"This wine opens sweet, smelling of lemon and grapefruit, and is appropriately creamy in mouthfeel, with a sliver of sweetness on the finish."
US,88.0,50.0,Sonoma Coast,Dunstan,"Made in the rich, forward, jammy style, this boasts a flavor of black raspberry jam. It's oaky, too, with a veneer of buttered cinnamon toast. This is a Pinot Noir that's easy to drink now."
Italy,94.0,88.0,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Montecariano,"Underbrush, dark berry, scorched earth and spice aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. The structured, refined palate delivers layers of ripe black cherry, blackberry jam, ripe raspberry, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, rounded tannins that give it a velvety texture. Drink 2017??026."
Italy,85.0,12.0,Barbera d'Asti,Gran Passione,"This offers earthy aromas of prune, scorched soil, pressed violet and a whiff of game. On the simple, informal palate, hints of black pepper and coffee add interest to the core of dried black cherry."
Australia,86.0,12.0,South Eastern Australia,McWilliam's Hanwood Estate,"With its warm and fuzzy nose of vanilla, buttered toast and freshly cut apples, this is a wine that's easy to like. The moderately intense palate shows some candied orange peel notes and fades to a moderate finish infused with lemon balm."
US,92.0,46.0,Snipes Mountain,Kerloo,"This small-production, single-vineyard Grenache is direct and appealing with notes of raspberry compote, strawberry, orange peel, violets and tapenade. The palate is pure silk, elegant in its styling with an extended finish."
Italy,92.0,40.0,Gattinara,Nervi,"Polished and balanced, this elegant red opens with scents of rose, red berry, tilled earth and truffle. The firmly structured palate delivers juicy raspberry, crunchy red cherry, licorice and a hint of nutmeg alongside bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. Drink 2018??030."
US,93.0,42.0,Edna Valley,Domaine Alfred,"Here's a dense, dramatic young Syrah. It's potent in black currant, cherry, anise and dark chocolate flavors, with plenty of toasty new oak. But more notable is the structure. Fine, ripely sweet tannins, good acidity and moderate alcohol make it balanced and even ageworthy over the next 6 years."
US,83.0,15.0,Paso Robles,Bridlewood,"Dusty aromas comprise the dull nose on this bottling. Once sipped, there isn't a lot of distinct flavor, save for some blackberry notes. It will work for a backyard barbecue of ribs and saucy chicken."
Italy,88.0,35.0,Toscana,Terre del Marchesato,"This opens with aromas of pressed acacia flowers, ripe stone fruits and dried sage. The palate isn't overly sweet, offering dried apricot, wildflower honey and toasted almond notes."
US,86.0,24.0,Napa Valley,Vermeil,"Dryish and crisp, this shows citrus, lemongrass, herb and honey flavors, with a sweet bitterness that will play well with a wide range of food, especially modern Asian fare."
US,86.0,35.0,Pennsylvania,Chaddsford,"Another lovely wine from Chaddsford, with both class and a delicate touch. A pretty, poised nose of black pepper and spice are followed by restrained, minerally flavors that leave a clean but complex wave on the palate.  Pair this with more elegant French dishes with a seafood slant."
US,84.0,28.0,Los Carneros,Manzanita Creek,"This is a diluted, straightforward wine dotted in pleasing layers of pear and papaya. It finishes clean and quick."
US,90.0,30.0,Wahluke Slope,Guardian,"All coming from StoneTree Vineyard and aged in half new French oak, this full-throttle wine offers aromas of blackberry jam, cassis and barrel spice. It's rich and high octane, showing some warmth on the finish."
US,92.0,49.0,Sonoma Coast,MacPhail,"Dense packed earth and a wild edge make for a complex experience in this vineyard-designate, from a hilltop site tended by fellow vintner and grape grower, Steve MacRostie. Blackberry, plum and herb flirt around light-bodied layers of black tea, with a finish of high-strung black cherry."
US,90.0,24.0,Dry Creek Valley,Dashe Cellars,"A first-rate Zin that shows the variety's briary power, unleashing a tidal wave of wild forest berry, plum, licorice, leather, chocolate and pepper spice flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Lip-smackingly good."
France,94.0,169.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Providence,"Both rich and dense, this wine shows the ripeness of the Merlot in 2010. It has firm fruit, touches of dark chocolate and licorice. With its concentration, this small vineyard is now in good form, producing ageworthy wines."
France,92.0,13.0,Madiran,ChÃ¢teau d'Aydie,"At the hands of Pierre Laplace, Tannat becomes smooth, rounded and shapely. It of course has tannins, but these are at the service of the rich fruit and the balanced acidity. The wine is full of character, a medley of fruit along with an elegant structure. It's going to develop well, so drink from 2018."
US,96.0,60.0,Willamette Valley,Ponzi,"This sensational effort comes from 20-year-old vines. It's a glorious wine; textural, generous and complex. The bright and fruity midpalate blends flavors of peach, quince, honey, tea and caramel, buoyed by juicy acidity and a touch of minerality."
US,91.0,40.0,Santa Clara Valley,Sarah's Vineyard,"There's a good deal of complexity on this top bottling from this Gilroy-based producer, with chopped black olive, cola, cloves, thyme and dried lemon peel on the nose. It's expansive on the palate, with strawberry, leather, sour cranberry and chopped herb flavors."
France,85.0,13.0,Coteaux Bourguignons,Louis Max,"Blending Pinot Noir and Gamay, this wine comes from a new Burgundy-wide appellation that can include fruit from Beaujolais. It's a style of wine that needs to be drunk young and fruity, with black cherry flavors and refreshing acidity. Drink this lively wine now."
US,90.0,70.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"This cuvÃ©e is made with the oldest WÃ¤denswil plantings at the estate. It's broadly fruity with delicious strawberry flavors front and center. Supporting acids are proportionate and fresh. Although relatively light, this elegant, graceful wine is ready for immediate enjoyment."
France,90.0,28.0,Fronton,ChÃ¢teau Coutinel,"The estate wine of Coutinel is dominated by the local NÃ©grette grape. With the addition of 15% Syrah and (unusual for this part of the world) 15% Gamay, the wine is structured while also juicy. Soft tannins and black fruits are shot through with an attractive perfumed character. Drink from 2018."
Spain,86.0,10.0,Campo de Borja,Bodegas Aragonesas,"Earthy raisin and prune aromas are good in an overripe way. Following the nose, this Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels dense, thick and chewy. Spicy stewy berry flavors taste chocolaty on a gummy finish."
Italy,89.0,78.0,Toscana,Castello di Meleto,"Made entirely with Malvasia Nera, this has subtle aromas of red berry and baking spice. The fresh palate delivers juicy red plum and white pepper along with a hint of cocoa framed in round tannins."
US,91.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Turnbull,"Softly delicious, this Cabernet is perfect for drinking now. Its blackberry, currant and cocoa flavors are housed in wonderfully ripe, accessible tannins. Shows the elegance of a superior Napa Cab."
US,93.0,34.0,Russian River Valley,MacRostie,"This wine is the sum of many spectacular sites?including Ritchie and Heintz Vineyards?some of the cooler-climate spots for grapes in the Occidental. Together they sing a tasteful tune that's salty and demure, with an elegant imprint of green apple, ocean breeze and stone."
France,88.0,90.0,Champagne,Dautel-Cadot,"Made from Pinot Blanc, allowed although rarely seen in Champagne, this is a crisp, stylish wine that has some bottle age. Baked apple and lemon flavors accompany tight acidity. The aftertaste is crisp and dry."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Passion Vineyards,"Consistent with previous releases, the Impervious is dark, dense and heavily extracted. Here the dominant grape is Cabernet Sauvignon?about 60%?and the fruit runs through very ripe raisins, figs and plums. It plays out broadly across the palate, full and generously oaky, with vivid streaks of balsamic and toffee. Drink soon."
US,85.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Elsom Cellars,"This Cabernet blend includes about 20% Syrah in the mix, which perhaps contributes to a lack of varietal character. It seems to be in a dumb phase, with no specific aromas and nondescript fruit. The finish turns acidic and chalky."
France,87.0,11.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Domaine Houchart,"A classic Provence red: charming, light and fresh, with pretty red fruit and straightforward flavors of plum and bramble. There's a bit of tannin here but this is a wine to drink young, before the fresh fruit fades. Try with grilled spare ribs."
US,90.0,28.0,Dundee Hills,Thistle,"A firm, full, distinctive Pinot Noir, from an organic vineyard in the Dundee Hills. Light fruit flavors of berry play second fiddle to notes of earth and clay, and drying tannins. The wine surprises with its length; it extends into a finish that continues to hold your attention and its focus, for a minute or more."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Taurasi,La Casa Dell'Orco,"Behind those characteristic aromas of black stone, resin and tar, this hearty Taurasi delivers a touch of raw fruit or black cherry. Some muddled spice notes appear and the wine delivers more used leather and dried tobacco on the close."
Italy,86.0,35.0,Collio,Marco Felluga,"This wine's oak and butterscotch aromas follow through to the lean palate, along with hints of toasted nut. Although linear and focused, it doesn't have enough fruit richness to stand up to the evident oak."
Australia,83.0,9.0,South Eastern Australia,Tall Poppy,"Exuberantly fruity, with mixed-berry scents and a straightforward palate of ripe cherries. Stays supple and generous through the sweetish finish. Drink up."
US,94.0,50.0,Yountville,Elyse,"From a vineyard in the western hills of the appellation, this wine shows lovely cool-climate characteristics without skimping on body or ripeness, expressing balance and grace. Tightly wound, it leans savory and firm, with clove, tobacco, black licorice and tomato leaf flavors and big tannins that call for further ageing. Enjoy 2023??033."
Spain,82.0,30.0,RÃ­as Baixas,Zarate,"Abnormally high pyrazines give this a sharp, oily nose. This feels and tastes much like it smells; the mouth is sharp and angular, while sour grapefruit flavors and oily bitterness on the finish suggest green Sauvignon Blanc."
Argentina,85.0,19.0,Mendoza,Tapiz,"Popcorn and butter are the lead aromas, and they give way to dusty baked apple over time. This wine feels round, but with just enough acidity. Flavors of candy corn, vanilla, spun sugar and ripe stone fruits finish sweet and fleshy."
US,87.0,40.0,Sonoma County,Arrowood,"This is a big, rich, oaky Chardonnay. It's a little heavy with all that caramel and buttered toast, but acidity brightens the pineapple and peach flavors, and the finish is clean and spicy."
France,91.0,25.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau Sainte Roseline,"The wine feels rich, dense and packed with ripe fruitiness. Delicious, refreshing acidity gives these red fruits a lift and crispness. This is a serious wine, demanding food."
Spain,85.0,11.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,"Aromas of roasted, grapy berry fruits come with oak-based notes of plastic and clove. This wine feels full in body, with hard tannins. Flavors of woodspice, hickory and black fruits finish with a lingering hint of wood smoke."
US,88.0,15.0,Sonoma County,Ravenswood,"This is a nicely made blend of Petite Sirah, Carignane, Zinfandel, Syrah, Alicante Bouschet and Barbera, defined by its generosity of power and tannin as well as a concentration of blackberry, Italian deli meat and leather."
Italy,89.0,35.0,Veronese,Suavia,"Made with overripe Garganega grapes, this opens with aromas of baked yellow fruit, lightly toasted oak and roasted almond. The round palate offers candied citrus zest, mature apple, dried apricot, a confectionary note and a hint of liqueur. Soft acidity accompanies the rich flavors."
France,90.0,32.0,Pessac-LÃ©ognan,ChÃ¢teau Bardins,"This is a ripe, full wine with flavors of pineapple and apricots. Still developing, it still has a strongly mineral texture, so wait until 2018. This third-generation family estate hosts monthly musical and tasting events with estate fruit, vegetables and honey for sale."
Italy,88.0,22.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,L'Antica Quercia,"Fresh in terms of acidity and soft in terms of fruity sweetness, this pretty sparkler delivers the best qualities. Pair this with lightly fried vegetable tempura."
France,86.0,17.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne Villages,Ferraton Pere et Fils,"Plummy and confected, with the baked-fruit character and hints of raisined fruit that can sometimes affect wines from the Plan de Dieu. Thankfully, the tannins are supple, and while there's some alcoholic warmth, it's still easy to drink. Drink now??014."
US,86.0,26.0,Napa Valley,Tudal,"Lots of rich, ripe blackberry, mocha, spice and oak flavors in this dry, robust blend. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and other varieties, it's a lusty young wine to drink now."
US,94.0,56.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Bethel Heights,"The top drop from Bethel Heights in this vintage, this is a dark, dense evocation of Pinot Noir at its most authoritative and engaging. It's a muscular mix of mulberry, blueberry and blue plum, with a dash of sassafras for good measure. The length and sense of throttled power suggest that this is a fine cellar candidate. Drink now through 2028."
US,95.0,200.0,Napa Valley,Joseph Phelps,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years."
US,91.0,35.0,Paso Robles,DENO,"There's an impressive freshness to this seven-year-old bottling, with both just-picked and baked blackberry aromas alongside pressed violets and dried ginger on the lavish nose. Vibrant olallieberries show on the sip, with violet-flavored cake adding to this study of purple flavors."
US,90.0,50.0,Napa Valley,Bright Angel WInes,"Built around a core of acidity, this wine conveys a preponderance of cedar and sage, seemingly influenced by a softer variety like Merlot, of which it has 12%. Plum and black currant provide the fruit component, before a sizably tannic finish."
Italy,83.0,15.0,Taburno,Ocone,"There's a slightly awkward quality that recalls soda, aniseed, candied orange and peppermint powder. These elements make for an odd  but distinctive wine with pungent pineapple flavors in the mouth."
US,87.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,Rumpus,"A fine AlbariÃ±o, this is brisk in acidity, moderate in alcohol and clean on the finish. Shows flavors of citrus fruits and minerals, with rich notes of pears. Great to drink now."
US,88.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Patterson,"This blend of Chardonnay (44%), Viognier (39%) and Roussanne (17%) has surprisingly light aromas of melon, peach and straw leading to full-feeling, tingly stone-fruit flavors. It wants more aromatically but the palate delivers the enjoyment."
Australia,85.0,25.0,Eden Valley,Maverick,"A subtle smoke component adds nuance to the aromas of peach and pineapple. The flavors match up precisely, adding a touch of marshmallow to the mix. This is fairly full bodied, yet lacks a bit of depth and flesh in its midpalate and finishes warm. Drink now."
Spain,88.0,16.0,La Mancha,Volver,"Purple as they come, with extracted aromas of boysenberry, blackberry, maple and bacon. It's a wide, flush wine with bulk, 14.5% alcohol and savage flavors of blackberry and smoky BBQ. Definitely for fans of big, modern Spanish wines; Old World enthusiasts will probably call it ?too modern??and overdone."
US,86.0,22.0,Napa Valley,V. Sattui,"Simple in buttered popcorn and toast flavors, this Chard has underlying flavors of pineapples. It's a dry wine, crisp in acidity. Made in the popular style for drinking now."
US,92.0,75.0,Red Mountain,Col Solare,"Cabernet Sauvignon (88%) takes the lead on this wine, with the balance Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah. Aromas of blackberry, blue fruit, flowers and barrel spice are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. Lightly chewy tannins provide some heft but have room to broaden."
Italy,89.0,15.0,Eloro,Curto,"This smooth red opens with blackberry, Mediterranean scrub and carob aromas. The easy-drinking, savory palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove and a peppr notes alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2021."
US,83.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,Hogue,"Perhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit."
Australia,88.0,15.0,South Eastern Australia,R Wines,"Full-bodied, lush and creamy in texture, this Merlot epitomizes the Marquis Philips style. There's a coating of charred oak, superripe fruit and plenty of size without much acid or tannin. Drink this slightly warm (16.5% abv) wine over the next 6?? months."
US,90.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Swiftwater Cellars,"A palate-pleasing mix of juicy boysenberry fruit, red licorice and bright spice, this quickly comes into focus. Concentrated and mouth-filling, it's a straightforward Syrah with an emphasis on fruit rather than funk."
Italy,87.0,19.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,CÃ  di Rajo,Aromas of beeswax and acacia carry over to the linear palate of citrus zest and toasted almond. Bright acidity and vivacious bubbles give it a vibrant edge.
US,87.0,39.0,Umpqua Valley,Reustle,"The reserve gets 90% new French oak, and there is a strong scent of oaky toast, with flavors that follow. Plump cherry fruit fills a broad midpalate, finishing with rather hard tannins that show a green edge."
Italy,88.0,40.0,Barbaresco,San Biagio,"Aromas of toasted oak, dark berry and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers bright red cherry, strawberry, thyme and sage alongside tightly knit tannins."
US,90.0,24.0,Ballard Canyon,Brander,"Grass, wet concrete, bitter orange rinds, wet hay and rosemary elements show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling. There is a firm, cement-like texture to the sip, much like licking rocks, with fresh lime peel flavors. It retains freshness days after opening."
US,86.0,16.0,Mendocino,Navarro,"Need a recommendation for a good house wine? This medium-bodied red has moderate fruit flavors, good structure from acidity and tannins, and a nice feeling of completeness. It is a catch-all blend of Zinfandel, Pinot Noir and four other grape varieties."
Argentina,92.0,110.0,Mendoza,El Enemigo,"This is top-notch Argentine Cabernet Franc. Savory, exotic, oaky blueberry and blackberry aromas set up a bold palate with ample acidity and modest tannins. Berry flavors and oak spice are the key flavors, while a buttery oak note and a pinch of salt rise up on the finish. Drink now through 2018."
US,90.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Janzen,"This approachable Cab is from both estate and sourced fruit, all Cabernet Sauvignon. It opens with a waft of tropical coconut before delving classically into smooth black cherry, cranberry and licorice, the tannins still monstrous and the oak packing a punch."
Italy,92.0,85.0,Montecucco,Collemassari,"Lombrone Riserva is an earthy, nicely concentrated wine that needs more time to age and integrate. It shows great structure with tight tannins and a long, beautiful finish characterized by cherry and delicate spicy shadings."
Spain,89.0,28.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de Murrieta,"Gold in color, this high-end Viura is cheesy, cidery and dense on the nose. Plump and resiny in feel, it offers woody flavors of baked white fruits. Hailing from a warm vintage, this goes back and forth between ripe, mealy and oaky and tense and nervy. If drinking now, expect more oak than fruit."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma Coast,JAQK Cellars,"Steely lemon and low oak star in this unfussy wine, which remains light bodied in spirit despite a rich finish of marshmallow and vanilla."
US,87.0,35.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cave B,"The Roman numeral 23 is an indication of the vineyard age; in the blend is 20% Cabernet planted at the same time. This is stiff and herbal, with brambly, wild raspberry and light cherry fruit and a dusty ash flavor as the tannins fade. Good length and balance."
France,85.0,14.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau des Antonins,"With its soft texture and rounded character, this is a generous wine. Acidity and crispness are some way behind the ripe green and white-stone fruits. The wine, though, is certainly balanced and ready to drink."
US,82.0,27.0,Sierra Foothills,Naggiar,"This bold, full-bodied wine with lots of fruit flavor seems to have faded a bit. It shows volatile aromas and overripe fruit notes that are getting a bit frayed around the edges."
France,90.0,22.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Cave de Hunawihr,"Creamy, almost mellow notes of Red Delicious apple pervade nose and palate. The mousse is very fine and creamy, heightening the beautifully pure fruit notes as well as a rounded autolytic note of brioche. This is light bodied but full of flavor, dry and creamy with a lovely long finish."
US,85.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,John Tyler,"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley."
Australia,89.0,35.0,Adelaide Hills,Shaw and Smith,"There comes a point when the pursuit of restraint becomes fruitless, and while this wine shows a wonderfully silky texture and an elegant finish, its subtle aromas and flavors of roasted cashew and citrus are indeed understated."
France,87.0,18.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Trenel Fils,"One of a range of wines under the Homage to Heritage import label, this fruit-driven wine has apple and green plum fruits, sustained by great acidity and a crisp, mineral texture. Drink from 2016."
US,88.0,50.0,Applegate Valley,Troon,"A whiff of leather introduces this tight, interesting, southern Oregon Syrah. Black fruits, iron filings, and smooth tannins mark a wine made from grapes that were carefully selected (just three rows of vines) and given special consideration by winemaker Herb Quady."
US,85.0,10.0,North Coast,Illuminate,A light citrus and pine scent is the first impression then the flavors of this medium-bodied wine turn to ripe pear and apple notes. It feels full and smooth on the tongue. It's a nice choice when you're on a budget.
Australia,85.0,20.0,Hunter Valley,Brokenwood,"So green and peppery on the nose it seems jalapeÃ±o-like. There is plenty of citrus fruit as well, giving a slightly disjointed impression a this early age. This medium-bodied wine turns lean on the abbreviated finish. Try now with raw oysters or clams, or hold for at least five years."
Argentina,87.0,10.0,Mendoza,Tilia,"This is a concentrated, well-oaked Cabernet with blackberry, cassis, leather and woody aromas. The palate is fairly tight and tannic, with good structure, while flavors of toasty, spicy plum and berry finish woody and with elasticity."
Italy,89.0,55.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Provolo,"From a little-known producer outside the Classico zone, here is a pretty wine with notes of cherry, chocolate, spice and subtle shadings of vanilla. In the mouth, it delivers soft tannins and good persistency of spice and fruit flavors."
US,88.0,30.0,Russian River Valley,Spicy Vines,"This small-production, nouveau-style wine was made without oak or filtering. Simple and juicy, it's festive, with effusive dried cranberry and cola spice notes that are soft and easygoing."
Italy,91.0,50.0,Chianti Classico,San Felice,"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Pugnitello and 10% Colorino, this savory, firmly structured wine offers aromas that recall baked plum, prune, resin, blue flower, leather and a balsamic note. The chewy, concentrated palate delivers juicy black cherry, mature blackberry, vanilla, cinnamon and mocha. Dusty tannins provide support. Drink through 2021."
US,88.0,20.0,Lodi,Criss Cross,"Sweet, delicious aromas of boysenberry and maple syrup, flavors like blackberry jam and a broad, generous texture turn this into a blockbuster wine. A touch of sweetness would make it great with something spicy and sweet like pork ribs."
US,93.0,65.0,Rutherford,Greyscale,"Small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec give further nuance to this lovely, grippy wine, built to age and unfold over time. Tangy in orange and red currant, it's holding back on its full power, sharing the more floral, high-toned aspects of itself first. Drink now through 2023."
US,86.0,11.0,Lodi,Frisk,"Light and pretty with watermelon and faint strawberry notes, Frisk is just slightly fizzy. Its aromas almost trick one into expecting a wine that's sweet, but it finishes dry and is in balance. Made from Grenache grapes, it's a likable, refreshing drink ready for the picnic basket or patio."
France,89.0,25.0,CrÃ©mant d'Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,"Appetizing notes of strawberry and Red Delicious apple create an inviting opening. These same flavors play on the very frothy, totally fruit-driven but dry palate. This is fresh and refreshing and with its fruit-forward style, it's an ideal pale-pink drink for summer parties."
US,84.0,10.0,Paso Robles,Grayson,"For an affordable, everyday red, this is a pretty good investment. It's dry and full-bodied, with berry, earth, mocha and spice flavors."
US,84.0,23.0,Santa Barbara County,Taz,"Simple, dry and direct. The silky texture houses slightly green flavors of tea, cherries and cola. Ready now."
Argentina,86.0,15.0,Uco Valley,Zuccardi,"Dark in color with a magenta tint, this Malbec is spunky and a touch crude on the nose, with wild berry and animal fur aromas. There's angularity to the palate, which is bland in the middle. Black-fruit, herbal, savory flavors finish short on volume and complexity."
US,88.0,30.0,North Fork of Long Island,Lieb,"Hints of nut and fresh-baked brioche lend savory nuance to bright apple flavors in this Pinot Blanc sparkling. Thick, almost chewy foam fills the palate but brisk citrus acidity on the midpalate balances things out nicely."
US,87.0,21.0,Sonoma County,Parkers Estate,"Good price for a Pinot of this quality. It's dry and silky in the mouth, with classic Pinot flavors of cherries, spices and cola, enriched with smoky oak."
US,89.0,26.0,California,Prima Materia,"This smooth, layered wine is medium bodied, well balanced and rich, with soft tannins to give it heft. Flavors run to black cherry, clove and cinnamon. The great sense of polish and composure make it a pleasure to drink."
France,87.0,20.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Charles Duret,"This is an attractive, fruity wine, produced in Meursault. It is fresh with lemon and tangy orange-zest flavors. A light tannic texture adds an edge to the fresh fruit."
France,93.0,25.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"Produced from old Malbec vines in the second terrace above the River Lot, the wine is darkly concentrated, with solid tannins and generous black fruits. Aging for 12 months has smoothed the square corners to create a wine that is hugely rich and rounded. It has the potential to age and become more opulent. Drink from 2020."
US,85.0,35.0,Paso Robles,Clayhouse,"Dry, acidic and austere, with cherry and tobacco flavors that finish thin and bitter. Not showing much on its own, but try with salty, rich beef and pork tapas dishes."
US,92.0,31.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Pali,"One of the better wines on the market in the $30 range, this bottling from winemaker Aaron Walker shows beet, rhubarb, raspberry and dried mint aromas. The flavorful red fruit on the palate is lively and boisterous, its acidity and peppery spice combining for a very memorable sipping experience."
US,88.0,40.0,Mount Veeder,Hess Collection,"This low-production Chardonnay shows the oaky, ripe notes. It has strong, forward tropical fruit, peach, lemon and lime flavors, with lots of buttered toast and vanilla bean.A firm minerality adds complexity. Drink up."
US,86.0,27.0,Rogue Valley,Kriselle,Intense scents and flavors of charred wood and espresso beans take full control here. There's little evidence of the underlying fruit. It's a stylistic choice?one that the winery has clearly embraced.
US,92.0,32.0,Red Hills Lake County,Sol Rouge,"A great find, this is fully ripe but not too full bodied, offering opulent dark plum and black currant aromas, broad and rich flavors, and a plush, velvety texture. Subtle cedar and spice tones from oak barrels add complexity to the dark fruit notes, and soft tannins fill in the texture and help the finish linger."
US,92.0,65.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Walt,"The aromas are super spicy, with cinnamon-glazed sour cherries proving most dominant. On the palate, black cherry and beet juice pair up with black tea, before culminating in a remarkably long and tantalizing spice-driving finish."
France,92.0,90.0,CÃ´tes du Lot,ChÃ¢teau LagrÃ©zette,"This is the high-elevation Kimmeridgian soil interpretation of Viognier at the LagrÃ©zette estate from enologist Claude Boudamani with consultant Michel Rolland. Despite its high alcohol, it is restrained and serious with structured fruits and a sense of balanced power. The fruits, apricots and white peach sing harmoniously with the pepper and spice from wood aging. Drink from 2017."
US,84.0,40.0,Paso Robles,Autry Cellars,"At five years, this Cabernet is not aging well. It's soft and simple, with the black cherry fruit flavors thinning out, letting hot alcohol show through."
Italy,88.0,16.0,Nuragus di Cagliari,Argiolas,"Aromas of white wild flower, white stone fruit, lemon zest and Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this vibrant white. The juicy palate offers succulent peach, pear and nectarine while crisp acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish. It closes on an almond note."
Italy,93.0,58.0,Barbaresco,Sottimano,"Aromas of red berry, tilled earth, menthol and dark cooking spice unfold in the glass. The structured, elegant palate doles out ripe wild cherry, mint, licorice, blood orange and chopped herb alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It's still tight so let it unwind for a few more years. Drink after 2019."
US,88.0,35.0,Monticello,Lovingston,"Decadent and intense, this smells like breakfast toast that has been slathered with red currant jam, mango butter and apricot preserves, topped with a drizzle of honey. The mouthfeel is rich, round and unctuous, with a zing of acidity that keeps it from seeming cloying. Notes of brÃ»lÃ©ed sugar and spice decorate the finish."
US,93.0,55.0,Santa Maria Valley,Nicora,"This bottling reveals that this historic vineyard can produce incredibly rich wine as well as the zestier styles it is known for. It shows black cherry, candied strawberry and bourbon-like spice on the nose. The mouthfeel is lavish, full of purple fruit and floral flavors, as well as peppery spice and vanilla warmth. The acidity and structure are solid, and there's a touch of tar on the finish."
France,91.0,120.0,Champagne,J. Dumangin Fils,"Part of a limited-release series named after Dumangin ancestors, this is a well-crafted, crisply dry wine. The ripeness comes from the soft Pinot Meunier that brings out red fruits and crisp apple flavors. It is a tight wine with delicate acidity. The bottle will certainly age, so drink now or from 2019."
US,89.0,25.0,Sonoma Coast,Valley of the Moon,"Oak barrels give this wine an edge of buttered toast and butterscotch, but it's not heavy, and the oak is perfectly in keeping with the underlying orange, mango and nectarine fruit. The finish is soft and honeyed, with a firm minerality that lends structure. It's yummy for drinking now."
US,94.0,65.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"Just beautiful. Showcases true Russian River characteristics of dryness, acidity and, in this vintage, exceptional ripeness without too much alcohol. Silky and complex, with deep, long flavors of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates, leather, cocoa and peppery spices. A tremendously attractive wine that will age for a good six years."
US,95.0,135.0,Napa Valley,Knights Bridge,"Dusty tannins and notes of dried herbs give this vigorous young Cabernet a mark of immaturity that strongly suggests time in the cellar, despite flashy blackberry and black currant flavors. The winery has done a great job with fruit from the Dr. Crane Vineyard for several years, and this majestic wine is right up there with the great '07 vintage. Best after 2018."
France,95.0,97.0,Chablis,Domaine Christian Moreau PÃ¨re et Fils,"This apple-crisp wine has tight acidity and touches of wood rounded out by yellow fruits. It is ripe and very full, the nervy, mineral character contrasting with the richness that is now developing. It will age slowly, so don't drink before 2020."
Argentina,87.0,15.0,Mendoza,Familia Marguery,"Dense and sweet up front, the nose is balanced and deep, with blackberry and graham cracker aromas. The palate feels grippy and concentrated, bearing blackberry, dark plum and black pepper flavors, with a lifted flower note. This finishes mild and spicy."
France,84.0,19.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Le Prince,"This blend of 54% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 9% MourvÃ¨dre and 3% Cinsault boasts some brambly fruit, but that's dominated by notes of leather and clove. It shows decent weight and concentration on the palate, but just a bit rustic overall."
Italy,87.0,22.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Borgoluce,"Lightly scented, this offers aromas of white spring flowers, citrus peel and a whiff of chopped herbs. The linear palate offers yellow apple, pear and thyme alongside racy acidity and brisk bubbles."
US,91.0,26.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years."
Australia,89.0,25.0,Barossa Valley,Teusner,"With aromas of cherry cough syrup and expensive oak, this is a big, rich, flashy Shiraz. Fine-grained tannins, balanced acidity and plenty of plush fruit mark the palate, but the oak is a little too much in the fore."
US,92.0,69.0,Napa Valley,World's End,"This is one of the most successful Syrah-Cabernet Franc blends in California. The Syrah brings blueberry and bacon flavors, and the Cabernet provides the black currant note and the tannic backbone. It's already delicious to drink, but allow it to breathe in a decanter for one or two hours."
Argentina,83.0,20.0,Mendoza,Gauchezco,"Peach and generic red-berry aromas take on a weedy component over time. This has a soda-like feel and flavors of yellow beet, mango and candied melon."
US,93.0,29.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Windy Oaks,"Slightly cloudy with a lighter, cranberry juice color, this multi-layered wine begins with a nose of strawberry, pomegranate and black cardamom. It is deliciously refreshing on the palate, with rounded tomato and smashed berries dancing with eucalyptus and bay leaf, providing fruit-meets-spice excellence."
US,89.0,32.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pondera,"Dineen Vineyard in the Rattlesnake Hills provides the fruit for this wine. The aromas of baking spice, herb, vanilla and poblano pepper are light while the flavors are elegant and creamy in feel. Coffee flavors linger on the finish."
Spain,87.0,11.0,Cava,Bach,"Straightforward apple and spice aromas draw you in. The palate on this value-priced brut Cava is fresh and focused, with mango, citrus, spice and dried herb flavors. It finishes fresh, with a touch of quince and apple flavor. Good for the price."
Spain,85.0,11.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"This semisweet Viura-Malvasia blend is neutral on the nose, then sweet as expected on the palate, with upfront residual sugar driving a flavor profile that includes mango, banana and apple juice. Sugary and bit cloying from start to finish, but good acidity keeps it in balance."
US,91.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Peachy Canyon,"Tropical aromas of mango, banana and honeysuckle lead the nose on what first seems like a fruity wine. But then the palate is much more restrained, clean and mineral-driven, with steely flavors surrounding the remnant ripe plantain-like tropicality."
US,92.0,55.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Pirouette,"Supple and inviting, from the nose of flowers and dark fruits, to the chocolatey tannins that lick the back of the throat, this is a fully-realized, smooth and most accessible red wine."
US,90.0,95.0,Mount Veeder,VGS,"Thick and concentrated, this wine needs more time to unwind, ideally through 2021, showing tightly sewn layers of blackberry, cassis, black olive and tar."
Spain,88.0,14.0,Calatayud,Las Rocas de San Alejandro,"Friendly aromas of kirsch and black cherry form the opening. The palate feels plump and flush, with good density and overall balance. In the mouth, nothing is complicated; the wine tastes of pure berry and plum fruits with some chocolaty oak on the finish."
US,89.0,48.0,Fair Play,Charles B. Mitchell,"Full-bodied and dry, this has a very deep, saturated color and aromas of spicy oak, raspberries and cherries. With velvety texture, fine tannins and a lingering finish, it's well structured and youthful tasting. It should improve through 2017."
US,90.0,35.0,Alexander Valley,Sutro,"Black cherry flavor stars in this full-bodied, brawny and expressive red that's thick with jammy fruit and interwoven tannins and oak."
US,90.0,20.0,Dundee Hills,Thistle,"Aged half in stainless, half in French oak, the captivating wine, made from organically grown grapes, suggests buttered popcorn in the nose and lemon rind in the mouth. There are spicy highlights and subtle hints of sage, toast, and a finishing pat of butter."
Italy,92.0,90.0,Sicilia,Feudo Principi di Butera,"This Nero d'Avola opens with mature black cherry, cinnamon and toasted almond aromas while the fresh, structured palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry jam and white pepper notes. Fresh acidity and polished tannins lend balance and a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2024."
US,85.0,38.0,Sonoma Valley,Buena Vista,"Raisin-baked plum defines this hearty, full-bodied and ultraripe wine, rich in red berry and robust on the finish."
US,84.0,18.0,Paso Robles,Paso Creek,"Tough, tannicly dry and gritty, this simple country Zin needs big barbecued beef or chicken dishes slathered with sweet BBQ sauce. It's packed with blackberry and cherry jam, blood orange, licorice, beef jerky and spice flavors."
US,86.0,69.0,Napa Valley,Cobblestone,"This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now."
US,88.0,75.0,Mount Veeder,Foyt Family,"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017."
US,86.0,33.0,Virginia,Ingleside,"The nose on this Petit Verdot is high-pitched, marked by some volatility. It offers notes of spiced cherry, herb and baguette, plus touches of raisin and fig. Concentrated and pliant, the palate bears dusty tannins, bright acids and alcoholic warmth. The medium-long finish features flavors of baking spice and turmeric."
Italy,93.0,55.0,Barolo,Sordo,"Structured and still remarkably young, this vibrant wine delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, cinnamon and licorice. It's balanced with bright acidity and youthfully austere tannins that need time to mellow out. Drink 2018??033."
US,85.0,18.0,Dry Creek Valley,Haraszthy,"This wine has a severity of sour cherry and yeasty baked bread on both the nose and palate, showing a lightness of touch in terms of ripeness and oak. It's simple and bright."
US,86.0,20.0,North Fork of Long Island,Martha Clara,"Whiffs of sea breeze led a saline tone to fresh apple and pear flavors in this brisk, light-bodied wine. It's crisp and approachable, finishing on slightly dilly, herbal note."
US,88.0,46.0,Russian River Valley,Matrix,"Juicy strawberry jam and dried herb combine for a forceful attack of bold, concentrated flavor and robust body, the wine textured in dusty tannin."
Argentina,84.0,13.0,Mendoza,Lexicon,"Opens with an odd whiff of masa or cornmeal along with herbal berry aromas. Feels angular and narrowing, with herbal plum and dark berry flavors. Turns greener with time, ultimately finishing with brown sugar sweetness and green pepper notes. Good but herbal."
US,90.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Charles & Charles,"The wines from this collaboration between Charles Smith and Charles Bieler continue to impress. The rosÃ© is mostly Syrah, with small amounts of Cinsault, Grenache, Counoise and MourvÃ¨dre. It's a complex, fashionably stylish take on rosÃ©. Light fruit flavors of berry and melon are detailed and refreshing, with exceptional length on the palate."
US,82.0,15.0,Central Coast,Clos La Chance,"Harsh in the mouth, with sharp acidity and uneven tannins, this has a candied-berry flavor."
Italy,88.0,21.0,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Villa Sandi,"Delicately scented, this inviting sparkler offers light aromas of white and yellow stone fruit along with a whiff of bread crust. The creamy, slightly sweet palate tastes of white peach, candied citrus peel and ripe apple set against a soft, frothy mousse. Bright acidity refreshes the rich flavors while a glazed-almond note graces the close."
France,89.0,40.0,Margaux,ChÃ¢teau LabÃ©gorce Margaux,"This second wine of LabÃ©gorce Margaux is named after the former neighboring estate LabÃ©gorce ZÃ©dÃ© that was amalgamated after the 2009 vintage. This is a ripe wine, full of the fruit of the vintage as well as having a firm dry tannic structure that will allow it to age. With juicy blackberry fruits still so youthful, it is going to be ready drink from 2019."
US,91.0,55.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tertulia,"Two-thirds Grenache with the balance Syrah and MourvÃ¨dre, this shows moderate aromas of coffee and pepper along with high-toned herbs and barrel spices. It's supple in texture, with the mouthfeel bringing much of the appeal."
US,87.0,12.0,California,Leese-Fitch,"There's an honesty to this Zin. It is an upfront, robust wine to drink now with pleasure. Peppery, it has solid flavors of wild berries, currants, crisped bacon and pepper."
US,83.0,20.0,Central Coast,Hahn,"In its youth, this Bordeaux blend is dry and a little harsh, with a green, minty edge to the cherry fruit and oak. The acidity accentuates the tannins, which give the wine a hard finish. Not going anywhere, so drink now."
Italy,88.0,70.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Cencioni Patrizia,"Dark-skinned berry, forest floor and coconut touches lead the nose. The dense, full-bodied palate evokes fleshy black cherry, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors, all set against chewy tannins. Drink through 2022."
France,86.0,14.0,Val de Loire,Domaine des Tilleuls,"Vanilla and ripe fruit aromas and a creamy texture give this wine its rounded fruity character. White fruits, caramel and light spice all come into play. The wine is ready to drink."
Argentina,92.0,30.0,Uco Valley,Finca la Celia,"This Malbec blend is ripe and woodsy, with cedary boysenberry and cassis aromas that are spicy and include some barnyard. A full, hammering palate is tanninc and grating. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and vanilla finish on both sides of the line that divides elegance from rugged intensity. Drink through 2024."
US,93.0,45.0,Rockpile,Bella,"The vintage was a good one for Bella's Zinfandels, and this one, which contains a splash of Petite Sirah and Carignane, is their best. It is quintessential Sonoma County Zin, dry, yet rich and heady, and floods the mouth with ripe raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic spices. Production was only 300 cases."
US,87.0,20.0,Sonoma Valley,Kunde,"Lots of spicy Zin flavors in this affordable wine. It's soft and rich, yet dry, with briary blackberry, black currant, cocoa and spice flavors that finish with a warm headiness."
France,86.0,30.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Jacques Charlet,"Broad and rich, it has already developed to give ripe yellow and green fruits that have fully integrated into the fresher, mineral structure. The wine is ready to drink."
US,93.0,40.0,Howell Mountain,Freemark Abbey,"Marked by crisp, zingy acidity that gives the lemon and lime fruit a mouthwatering tartness, this voluminous Chardonnay is perfect for drinking now, as a cocktail or with rich shellfish dishes. It's really elegantly constructed and stylish, a great restaurant wine."
Argentina,85.0,10.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,DoÃ±a Paula,"Big and fruity, and for the most part holds together and exhibits more good qualities than its faults. The flavor profile drives full-bodied black fruit and a finish that cuts out quietly. Not over the top in any way."
France,90.0,24.0,Tavel,PrieurÃ© de MontÃ©zargues,"This is pretty pale for a Tavel, with a coppery tinge to its pink color. Notes of lime zest, wet stone and modest cherry-berry notes finish on a bright citrus note."
Argentina,88.0,16.0,Mendoza,Bodega Toneles,"Baked, earthy aromas of raisin, fruitcake, ink and oak require plenty of air to show their best. A jammy, creamy, oaky palate is home to resiny flavors of vanilla, spice and berry fruits. The finish is woody, resiny and pasty, with ripe yet generic flavors in reserve."
US,99.0,300.0,Napa Valley,Alpha Omega,"This blend from individual blocks includes 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Merlot. Juicy and round, it expresses chocolate, vanilla, dark cherry and cassis flavors and is a joy to drink and experience evolve. Despite plenty of ripe power and lushness, it also boasts substantial elegance."
France,86.0,17.0,Vin de Savoie,Les Rocailles,"The wine is round and full in the mouth. The acidity gives a fresh character to the ripe caramel flavors that shine through the light texture. It is a wine that needs food, with its lively acidity giving a dry, mineral aftertaste."
US,93.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Southard,"Dark and bloody, this masterfully mixes layer upon layer of detail. Red meat, black olive, cassis and earth roll across the tongue, while hints of flower and chocolate linger in the nose. Complex, tart and earthy, this is as good as it gets in this price range."
US,87.0,20.0,Yorkville Highlands,Yorkville Cellars,"A subtle SÃ©millon that would make for a delightful apÃ©ritif or pair expertly with seafood, its crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and citrus?mostly grapefruit and lime?go easy on the tongue."
France,92.0,25.0,Sancerre,Vincent Grall,"This intense wine comes from a small parcel of six acres. Produced from organically grown grapes, it is crisp, clean and with a directness that is both refreshing and initially shocking in its intensity. The wine is rich, full in the mouth, tight and still young. Drink from 2017."
US,89.0,23.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lafond,"Apples, sea salt, green pear and buttered popcorn aromas convey both restraint and ripeness on the nose of this wine by pioneer Pierre Lafond and longtime winemaker Bruce McGuire. There's tarragon tension once sipped, with flavors hovering between soft ruby-red grapefruit pith and ripe red apples, keeping the mouth watering throughout."
US,91.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Lake Sonoma,"This wine does better when alcohol levels are elevated, which ripens and fattens the fruit. Here,  the alcohol is 15%, and the juicy flavors range from blackberry and mulberry jam through chocolate and sweet briary tobacco to exotic vanilla and Asian spices. Then there's the structure, near-perfect in acids and tannins."
US,92.0,54.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Testarossa,"Bright and fresh aromas of black currant and Concord grape meet with violet and a sense of chalkiness on the nose of this blend of 57% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Merlot. The sip is bone-dry, relying on a graphite backbone and relatively light body to carry forth purple fruit flavors."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de la Concordia,"Earthy cherry aromas are leathery as well. A dry, high-acid palate is grabby and fairly sharp in texture. Raw, salty flavors of plum and wood spice finish with tough, drying tannins."
Argentina,82.0,13.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,Notro,"Pointed red-plum aromas are lemony and leathery. The palate is decidedly tomatoey and acidic, with flavors of plum skin, currant and pepper. An herbal, spicy, drying finish feels raw and tastes sour."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Collio,Collavini,"Lean and linear, this offers white spring flower and citrus impressions. It's simple but well made and refreshing."
France,92.0,60.0,Champagne,Lombard et Cie,"With 80% Chardonnay in the blend, this is a mature-tasting wine, much of which comes from the CÃ´te des Blancs. It has an enticing toasty character that has changed the initial fruitiness of the wine to one where the secondary flavors dominate. It is ripe, intense with acidity, a tangy texture, spice and almonds. Drink now."
France,93.0,29.0,Bandol,La Bastide Blanche,"This dark-hued wine is still very closed and firm. Dark chocolate and licorice flavors are prominent against a backdrop of black fruit, hinting at the wine's considerable wood aging. It does have great weight and richness, so let it develop and drink from 2017."
US,90.0,26.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Melville,"Acidity and ripe fruit mark this Chardonnay, which is lovely to drink now. Don't chill it too much, to allow the orange, pineapple and passionfruit flavors to express their nuances."
France,85.0,14.0,Coteaux Varois en Provence,Estandon,"This easy, open wine has ripe red fruits and lively acidity. A warmer, rich core brings out a generous character. It is fruity and soft at the end."
France,83.0,12.0,Vin de France,L'original French Kiss,"This wine is textured, tight and seems to be missing out on fruit. It has pepper, spice and just a few hints of green plums. There is a bitter aftertaste."
US,86.0,25.0,North Fork of Long Island,Bedell,"Zesty and spry on its feet, this light-bodied rosÃ© offers more mineral than fruit. It's still quite closed in profile, but reveals delicate red-cherry and apple notes as it aerates."
US,91.0,40.0,Applegate Valley,Quady North,"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill."
US,88.0,30.0,Oregon,Irvine Family Vineyards,"Here is a spicy racy palate-ripping Chardonnay. The fruit rules here, a tasty mix of lime, pineapple, grapefruit and green apples. It was barrel fermented in French oak, though its flavors are more along the lines of a stainless steel style."
Australia,90.0,19.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"The 2006 d'Arry's Original offers a welcome combination of dark, earthy complexity with notes of cola, plum and black cherry. It's full in the mouth and expansive on the palate, leading into a long finish redolent of peppery spice. Drink now??012."
Argentina,87.0,15.0,Mendoza,Tomero,"Bright fruit, mildly creamy, with good zest and acidity. Shows a sweet, savory center with hints of brown sugar and spice sitting along the edges. Easy tannins make it a friendly style; good for near-term drinking. No cellaring necessary."
US,89.0,32.0,Fair Play,Cedar Creek,"Pretty in floral spiciness, this wine is a worthy continuation from the previous vintage, leathery and restrained, more soft red and blue fruit than burly black. Smooth and earthy, the finish is lingering. This food-friendly Petite Sirah is ready to enjoy now with a hearty roast."
US,88.0,10.0,Columbia Valley (WA),14 Hands,Vibrant aromas of tangerine and flowers lead to sweet fruit flavors that show persistence. Enjoy it as an apÃ©ritif.
US,84.0,44.0,Russian River Valley,SuncÃ© Vineyard & Winery,"Acids and tannins dominate, at the expense of fruit, giving this Pinot Noir a hard, rustic feel. The cherry flavors aren't strong enough to bust through the dryness."
France,90.0,21.0,Fleurie,Domaine de Bel Air,"Annick and Jean-Marc Lafont's three acres on the slopes below the chapel of la Madone give a firm and concentrated cru wine that will repay aging. There are layers of red-berry fruits that are cut with solid tannins and a dry core. The wine will age, so drink from 2018."
France,88.0,70.0,Gevrey-Chambertin,Manuel Olivier,"Retaining a good sense of structure, this is also a relatively light and fresh Gevrey-Chambertin. It has plenty of raspberry and red plum flavors and lively acidity at the end. Drink from 2015."
US,90.0,25.0,Sierra Foothills,Easton,"Easton's small-production Barbera is tight, showcasing its mountain-grown fruit, and quite savory and leathery in style. With a backbone of blacker fruit than Cooper Ranch, it's earthy and ready for mushroom-laden pasta dishes or risotto."
US,88.0,25.0,Napa Valley,Envy,"Envy has a very consistent track record with this bottling. The 2011 is typical of the house style, off-dry and honeyed, with pleasant citrus and grass flavors that veer into riper tropical fruits."
Spain,91.0,250.0,Dominio de Valdepusa,Marques de GriÃ±on,"Talk about an incredibly ripe wine; this deals prune, marzipan, tobacco and sandalwood aromas along with loads of blackberry and cassis. In the mouth, it's tannic like nails, with enormous blackberry and chocolate flavors that narrow down on a fast-charging but ultimately short finish. You can equate this to a rough and bumpy road that takes you to a nice vista. Drink through 2020."
Italy,94.0,90.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Tenuta di Sesta,"Tenuta di Sesta is run by a perfect father-mother-daughter-son team and is located in one of the least-traveled corners of Montalcino. The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age. Cellar this wine 10 years."
US,88.0,95.0,Santa Barbara County,Feliz Noche,"Deliciously soft and easy to like now. Flatters the mouth with blackberry, currant, mocha, licorice,  bacon and crushed black pepper flavors that finish dry and elegant. A blend of Syrah, Grenache, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo."
Spain,89.0,21.0,Rioja,ViÃ±a Otano,"This shimmering barrel-fermented blend of 75% Viura and 25% Tempranillo Blanco opens with stable aromas of apple, butter and fresh corn. An elegant fairly light palate delivers a mix of dry oak, nectarine, peach and apple flavors. This is lithe and comfortable on the finish, with modest but noticeable residual oak."
France,88.0,32.0,Pouilly-FumÃ©,ChÃ¢teau de Tracy,"Maison Louis Latour doesn't make this pricey Pouilly-FumÃ©, but is responsible for its commercialization in the U.S. Slightly grassy nuances accent gooseberry and grapefruit aromas, while the palate picks up a pleasant creaminess and weight. The crisp finish is dry and flinty, garnished by fresh green herbs."
US,86.0,16.0,Oakville,Turnbull,"Aromas of glue, bacon fat and earth make for a confounding bouquet that really doesn't welcome you in. The plump, creamy palate has some bright citrus, but mostly it's about underripe melon. The tart, short finish is clean, but not terribly convincing."
Spain,88.0,10.0,Rioja,El Coto,"Good, clean and pleasant. The nose has pure apple and pear aromas along with a hint of vanilla and powdered sugar. It's fresh in the mouth, with lively apple, white peach and green banana flavors. Closes well and stays zesty and true from start to finish."
US,89.0,40.0,Napa Valley,Sensorium,"A pretty nice young Cab, though the weather was too hot and the wine is deficient in acidity. But the flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and new oak are delicious, and the tannins are smooth and silky."
US,95.0,65.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e to this vastly enjoyable wine."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Beneventano,Donnachiara,"Citrus, honey and cantaloupe notes open the bouquet of this food-friendly white wine. The mouthfeel shows acidity without being sharp or sour."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Moscato d'Asti,Tenuta Olim Bauda,"Centive is a pleasant and lively Moscato d'Asti with fragrant tones of dried flowers, jasmine soap, lavender honey and sun-ripened peach. The smooth mouthfeel is capped by loads of frothy cream."
US,94.0,59.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cumbre of Vine Hill,"Shows the dramatic way that this mountainous region south of San Francisco can ripen Pinot Noir to such perfection. Brilliant in raspberry, cherry, sassafras, mocha, anise and cinnamon flavors, with rich notes of smoky cedar, it shows enough tannins to age it for a few years."
US,93.0,50.0,Green Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"This resplendent white offers a wealth of wet stone minerality and crisp, lemony acidity, with just a subtle hint of oak. From old vines, it boasts tangerine and anise flavors on the palate, with tropical notes of guava and mango and a jolt of nuttiness."
France,85.0,20.0,Morgon,Georges Duboeuf,"While there is a good structure here, this wine is spoiled by banana flavors that dominate the otherwise attractive red berry fruits. Acidity and a dry tannic core suggest some aging, so maybe the wine will round out."
US,91.0,24.0,Central Coast,Treana,"The Hope family dives into Chardonnay with this sleek bottling. The nose is tight with pink-grapefruit pith, unfurled white flowers and crushed seashells. Intriguing and elegant flavors of grapefruit blossom, guava shavings and sea salt buzz across the palate with humming electricity."
US,86.0,48.0,Sonoma Valley,Bonneau,"This is an easy-drinking Cab for enjoying now. It's soft and fruit-forward, bursting with ripe, oak-tinged cherry and raspberry jam flavors."
US,90.0,24.0,Sonoma Coast,Chateau St. Jean,"After years of producing a basic Sonoma County Pinot, the winery turns to the coast for this blend of several vineyards. The results are wonderful. The wine is rich and expressive in raspberries and cherries, with touches of bacon, cola and the sweetness of new French oak. Drink this silky wine now."
France,91.0,20.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de Chambert,"This is an impressively dark, rich wine made from biodynamically grown grapes to give pure perfumed fruitiness over dense, dusty tannins. The wine has a mineral texture to balance the black currant fruits and generous ripeness. It does need to age: give it until 2018."
US,88.0,25.0,North Fork of Long Island,Clovis Point,"Clovis Point's Black Label Chardonnay shares the ripe, voluminous feel of it's standard-label Chard, but offers a bit more freshness and structure. It's plump and full bodied, slick with honey and mango flavors, but cutting citrus acidity lends refreshment and balance. The moderately long finish is marked by lingering notes of nut, spice and toast."
US,86.0,15.0,California,Jack's House,"This solid, well-made wine has pleasant apple and pear flavors, light herbal accents, medium body and a smooth texture."
US,94.0,55.0,Russian River Valley,Williams Selyem,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years."
US,93.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"Crafted from six vineyards within the Dutton family's holdings, this is a pretty wine, smooth and supple with a balance of acidity and light body. Citrus and apple vie for attention with a slight tropical note and expansiveness of ginger cookie and toffee."
Italy,85.0,11.0,Chianti,Caposaldo,"This easy-drinking blend of 75% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 5% Malvasia has spice-laced ripe black cherry aromas. The light, simple palate shows sour cherry and clove with soft tannins. Drink soon."
US,87.0,30.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Fuligni,"Here's a youthful expression of Sangiovese Grosso in which the grape's trademark acidity and fruity brightness shine through. Cherry, white almond, dried raspberry and rum cake notes present a soft, chewy feel in the mouth, although the overall structure is solid."
US,97.0,54.0,Russian River Valley,Merry Edwards,"A splendid, near-perfect Pinot, although it's very young and will benefit from time in the bottle. Few Pinots offer richer, more massive flavors. Just explodes on the palate with raspberries, cherries, persimmons, Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and cinnamon spices, yet the tannin-acid structure keeps it all balanced. A joy to drink as it warms and changes in the glass. Now??014."
US,82.0,18.0,Virginia,Naked Mountain,"Diminished scents of rubber, dried cherry and raspberry translate onto the nimble, glossy palate. The acidity becomes jumpy on the finish, leaving the wine feeling tense and asymmetrical."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Collio,Collavini,"This vibrant Pinot Grigio offers delicate scents of white flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of citrus. The crisp palate shows crunchy Granny Smith apple, green pear and tangerine while bracing acidity gives it a clean finish."
Spain,84.0,12.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Montalvo Wilmot,"Floral, spicy plum aromas come with notes of lemon and chili pepper. This Tempranillo is rudimentary, with a creamy, pasty palate. Baked cherry and berry flavors end with almost syrupy thickness and a touch of chocolate flavor."
France,92.0,70.0,Champagne,H. Blin,"Very dry in style, this is a beautifully crisp, tight and taut Champagne. It has citrus and green apple flavors, and is steely in character while also fruity. It could do well with some more bottle age."
US,87.0,11.0,Lodi,McManis,"Spicy, smoky oak aromas dominate this dark-colored and full-bodied wine. Cherry and raspberry emerge as the flavors. The texture is plush but not quite soft, as firm tannins and moderate acidity give it good structure."
Argentina,84.0,11.0,Mendoza,Terrazas de Los Andes,"Sharp and sassy for the most part, but with airing things improve a bit and you start to find red fruit and honest spice. The feel is lean and vibrant, with jumpy acids creating a crisp mouthfeel. Will settle somewhat but won't ever deliver much in the way of rich berry fruit or a chewy mouthfeel."
France,95.0,200.0,Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Hosanna,"Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced. It shows that a wine can be powerful without being high alcohol."
Australia,90.0,42.0,Yarra Valley,Giant Steps,"This reasonably full-bodied Chardonnay manages to retain a sense of freshness and crispness throughout. Subtle oak and vanilla notes frame peach and pineapple fruit, while the finish is long and citrusy clean."
US,84.0,10.0,Santa Barbara County,Meridian,"Here's a basic, Santa Barbara Chardonnay that shows off the region's cool-climate friendliness to the variety. It's dry and crisp and creamy, with pineapple, lime and oak flavors."
France,91.0,20.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,ChÃ¢teau LÃ©oube,"This is a soft and ripe wine, full of rounded red berry fruits. The fruit is boosted by its acidity to give a fresh feel. The texture is soft, with a shot of pepper to add complexity at the end."
US,88.0,26.0,Paso Robles,Barton,Plum and bubblegum aromas show on the inviting nose of this bottling from the Barton family. There is an energetic tension to the palate that propels its light raspberry fruit flavors into the finish.
Argentina,90.0,24.0,Mendoza,Bodega Catena Zapata,"There's plenty of size, sweetness and fruit on the nose. It feels rich and ripe, with an exemplary weight-to-acid ratio, and it tastes juicy, fruity and friendly, with notes of black licorice and dark chocolate on the finish. A wine that properly blends Malbec's sweet and sultry sides."
US,92.0,65.0,Willamette Valley,Penner-Ash,"This light- to medium-bodied wine delivers well-integrated strawberry preserve flavors, along with hazelnut, malt and milk chocolate highlights. It's smooth and well proportioned, and should drink well through 2023."
Spain,91.0,30.0,Rioja,Ysios,"Arguably the best Ysios reserva to date; it shows a full, lightly baked bouquet with berry aromas, spice, barrel char and herbs. Feels fresh and lush, with balance and tasty flavors of black fruit, fig, tobacco and chocolaty oak. It's a touch oaky and warm on the finish, but elegant and very well made. Drink now through 2015."
US,91.0,36.0,Sonoma County,David Bruce,"This is a deliciously spicy exploration of wild strawberry and succulent waves of medium-bodied earth and structure. Lengthy and complex, it makes a case for the beauty that can come from blending from various vineyards."
France,88.0,22.0,Mercurey,Vignerons de Buxy,"The largest appellation in the CÃ´te Chalonnaise produces here a foursquare, solid wine. It has red fruits, although the structure is what is dominant at this stage. There is a dry, smoky, meaty flavor that marches with the final acidity."
US,90.0,30.0,Napa Valley,Black Stallion,"An affordable appellation wine, there's an introductory whiff of meaty bacon that signals full-bodied goodness, followed by soft, integrated layers of cherry and vanilla. Thick and densely concentrated, it's drinking well now and should please many palates."
US,90.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Buty,"Honeycrisp apples come to mind at first sip, along with dollops of peach, lemongrass and caramel. The mouthfeel is fresh and flavorful, with excellent texture and length."
US,87.0,50.0,Oakville,Spoto,"Although this is from Oakville, which is hallowed ground for Bordeaux-style wines, it's fairly simple and direct. With a soft, drink-me-now mouthfeel, it offers flavors of blackberries, black currants and mocha."
US,92.0,65.0,Napa Valley,Jean Edwards,"Black currant stars in this mountain wine, juicy and brushy in big, pillowy tannin. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further. It should show best 2020 through 2023."
France,87.0,28.0,Lalande de Pomerol,ChÃ¢teau Sergant,"This ripe, rich and Merlot-dominated wine comes from the western section of Lalande de Pomerol. Juicy black-fruit flavors are lifted by acidity and given structure by the firm wood-aging texture. The wood needs to integrate with the fruit, so drink from 2018."
Australia,89.0,32.0,Pyrenees,Taltarni,"The top Australian Cabernets retain distinct varietal character without veering into overly green territory. This one features hints of mint and tobacco alongside cassis and coffee. The texture is a treat: creamy at first, then firming up on the finish. Drink now-2015."
Spain,87.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y LeÃ³n,PeÃ±ascal,"This fresh but generic Sauvignon Blanc offers white-fruit aromas and zesty passion fruit scents. The mouthfeel is juicy, while flavors of grapefruit, lime and orange finish with a touch of pithy bitterness. Along the way, riper notes of melon fade in and out."
France,85.0,12.0,CÃ´tes de Gascogne,Domaine du Tariquet,"Produced at the largest family-owned vineyard in France, this is a simple, fruity, immediately attractive wine. There are both citrus and more tropical fruit flavors in the wine, alongside a herbal, grassy touch from the Sauvignon Blanc and Colombard in the blend. The wine is ready to drink."
France,93.0,84.0,Cornas,Jean-Luc Colombo,"A full-bodied, rich wine, with tannins either supremely smoooth or just concealed under masses of plummy fruit. Yet despite the enormous ripeness, it's not lacking nuance, boasting savory notes of espresso and leather. Drinkable now, but should age through 2023, at least."
US,88.0,18.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Three Rivers,"Blended with 9% SÃ©millon, this wine has aromas of lemon curd, starfruit, barrel spices (18% new French oak) and fig. It's full bodied, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish."
US,85.0,18.0,California,The Naked Grape,"This is a pleasant, medium-bodied wine with ripe fruit and spice flavors and a touch of tannin providing firmness. What it lacks in varietal personality it makes up in value."
US,87.0,12.0,Paso Robles,Liberty School,"Great price for a Cabernet this nice. It's dry, smooth and classic in blackberry and currant flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. Just a bit too acidic; a rich steak will help."
US,89.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Copper Belt,"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot (40%), this wine is finished off with Pinot Noir. Vanilla, baking spice, licorice, woodspice and cherry aromas lead to plump, tart cranberry flavors that linger. The wood is heavy at times, which is a shame as the balance of the fruit is spot on."
Spain,85.0,20.0,Alella,RaventÃ³s de Alella,"This varietal Xarello feels more flat than vivid. It has fleshy yet generic white fruit aromas, ripe melon flavors and a tired finish."
Australia,91.0,29.0,McLaren Vale,D'Arenberg,"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020??030."
Argentina,91.0,38.0,Uco Valley,Flechas de los Andes,"Quite spicy, with the Syrah element offering a meaty, leathery quality that varietal Malbecs just don't have. The nose is rich, with some mocha giving it oaky warmth. the mouthfilling palate is packed with kirsch, cassis and blackberry, while the finish is smoky with some fiery heat. Needs another year or two to come together."
Italy,90.0,35.0,Franciacorta,Lantieri de Paratico,"This pretty, salmon-colored wine opens with aromas of red berry, iris and a yeasty note of bread dough. On the palate, strawberry and raspberry take center stage while clove and vanilla add interest. It's balanced with bright acidity, while a soft mousse adds elegance."
France,87.0,27.0,Chorey-lÃ¨s-Beaune,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont,"Perfumed and fruity, this is a gentle, lightly structured wine. It has red fruits, soft tannins and plenty of bright acidity. It's not a wine for long aging and can be drunk now??018."
US,86.0,10.0,California,Leaping Horse,"This does a good job of balancing lively pear and apple flavors with dashes of toast and butter. It's medium to full-bodied, dry and has enough crispness to help the flavors linger."
Spain,89.0,13.0,Rioja,Valdelamillo,"Aromas of vanilla and coconut share space on the nose with ripe notes of blackberry and prune. This feels just fresh enough, with ample body. Ripe berry, raisin and chocolate flavors end a touch flat."
US,87.0,10.0,Lake County,Line 39,"The curve on this wine has been going up and up, and this '09 is their best yet. It's bone dry and savory in acids, with ultraclean citrus, mineral and white flower flavors. Just delicious as a cocktail sipper."
Argentina,85.0,13.0,Mendoza,Alamos,"Roll out the barrel as far as aromas go; it's got a lot of toast and popcorn. The palate is creamy and smooth, with apple, peach and a fairly high level of sweetness. Regular on the finish, with some leftover popcorn and spiced apple."
US,86.0,55.0,Santa Barbara County,Fess Parker,Raspberry jam and oak are the flavors of this drink-me-now wine. Brisk acidity gives it a mouthwatering cleanness. The single-clone angle has resulted in a certain one-dimensionality.
Italy,87.0,12.0,Barbera d'Asti,Cantine Volpi,This luscious Barbera d'Asti shows plump aromas of black cherry and blackberry backed by lighter tones of spice and tobacco. You'll feel the freshness of the acidity and will want to pair this wine with cheesy pasta al forno.
Spain,85.0,45.0,Rioja,Palacios Remondo,"Fleshy, plump aromas of baked apple, melon and barrel smoke set up a honeyed, flat palate. This Viura is melony and mealy tasting, with notes of mushroom, papaya and bitterness on the finish. Overall this is short on flavor and feels creamy and heavy."
US,88.0,29.0,Red Mountain,Genoa,"This wine offers notes of vanilla, coconut, chocolate and cherry candy. It's richly flavored with a core of dark fruit backed by lightly grippy tannins."
Spain,86.0,12.0,Ribera del JÃºcar,Spanish Vines,"Big, sweet and deep in black fruits, with aromas of turned earth and sweet spices. The palate is tannic and heavy but offers good pop, and the flavors of blackberry and cola are full-force. Finishes thick and dark, with toasty spice notes and kick."
US,86.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Bethany Vineyard,Bright aromas of macerated cranberries and maraschino cherries along with vanilla and wood spice accents are followed by tart and appealing fruit flavors. The oak gets a bit too prominent.
US,92.0,36.0,Santa Clara Valley,Sarah's Vineyard,"Tons of sagebrush, dried thyme and chaparral scrub enliven the dark mulberry fruit on the earthy nose of this bottling. It's a hearty mouthful of wine once sipped, with more sagebrush, clove and garrigue elements adding complexity to the juicy black fruits. There's quite an aromatic mintiness to the palate."
US,92.0,24.0,High Valley,Eruption,"This full-bodied wine packs a lot of punch in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. The color is extremely dark, and the flavors resemble dark chocolate, black cherries and baking spices. It is dry in style, with lip-smacking, nicely astringent tannins that counterbalance all that richness."
US,83.0,39.0,Santa Maria Valley,Deep Sea,"Okay for everyday drinking, but a little soft and heavy, with sweet, jammy raspberry flavors and a touch of green unripeness. It's also hot in the finish."
US,90.0,32.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Deep Sea,"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc, really fine. It showcases how well this cool little corner of Monterey County, with its stony soils, ripens white wines. Brisk in acidity and laden with minerals, it offers rich flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers, white currants and spices."
Italy,90.0,17.0,Alto Adige,Erste Neue,"Creamy and crisp, this lovely wine is delicately scented with yellow apple and mineral. The flavors carry over to the linear, elegant palate along with a note of pear while vibrant acidity lends plenty of verve."
US,92.0,28.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Basel Cellars,"Full in the mouth, rich with a mix of pastry fruits, fruitcake, baking spices, clove and coffee, this decadent pleasure is like drinking a Christmas cake. Raisins soaked in a Bourbon sauce come to mind, along with plum pudding."
US,88.0,17.0,Central Coast,Edna Valley Vineyard,"This widely available and comparatively cheap bottling nabbed quality fruit to present aromas of black raspberry, dark cranberry, crushed graphite and chaparral. There is refreshing if slightly dried fruit on the palate, where blackberry paste is lifted by thyme, marjoram and turned-earth flavors."
France,94.0,55.0,Alsace,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Something floral and stony appears on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and something uncompromising and hard. The palate then packs a real punch: the wine hits you like a bullet of concentrated freshness and citric verve. This is bundled and effective, delivering a hit of ripened freshness with its lemon-zest dominated, dry tanginess. The finish has something juicy and luscious and is absolutely dry and clean. Totally lip-smacking. Drink now through 2027."
US,90.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Panther Creek,"The earthy aromas suggest fresh compost, and wrap around ripe raspberry and cherry fruit that tastes like a fresh baked pie. The mouthfeel remains light, almost airy, with a nod to Beaujolais. Drink this over the next two or three years."
Italy,85.0,15.0,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Villa Rubini,"This is an easy-going, clean Chardonnay that delivers pretty aromas of creamy peach, mature apricot and honey. It is compact and balanced and would pair well with Chinese take-out or summer salads."
US,88.0,25.0,Red Mountain,Corvus,"Assorted aromas of blue, red and black fruit and dried herbs lead to ripe, full-bodied fruit flavors with a lingering finish. Chewy tannins back it, with the volatiles amped up."
Italy,92.0,155.0,Toscana,Avignonesi-Capannelle,"A perfect collaboration between two celebrated Tuscan estates, this plush wine is stacked tall with pretty aromas of cola, sweet spice, root beer, clove, toast and forest fruit. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine takes on marvelous shape in the mouth where it builds in intensity."
US,90.0,55.0,Yountville,Rocca,"What's so nice about this Cab is its balance and delicacy, without the heaviness that can mar a more alcoholic wine. It shows polished flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola and cedar, with a long, fine finish of cassis liqueur. Really an elegant sipper, this wine is best now and for a couple years."
US,91.0,35.0,Dundee Hills,Torii Mor,"The winery does not make much white wine, and this release is limited to just 55 cases. Light gold, it's scented with buttered popcorn and toasted hazelnuts, with a solid core of ripe apple, pear and nectarine fruit. It finishes with a powerful burst of vanilla custard."
US,91.0,42.0,Russian River Valley,Cellars 33,"Dark and brooding with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, this fresh, juicy wine boasts generous oak and tannin. Sourced from the estate vineyard of Freeman Winery in Sebastopol, it gains clove and dried herb nuances as it develops."
US,91.0,70.0,Russian River Valley,Lynmar,"Block 10 was made with 25% whole cluster fermentation, the result bold and impressive in cola cherry and soft baking spices, an intriguing floral note akin to geranium or gardenia highlighting the palate. Midway, expect an expansive opening of the wine, before notes of cocoa and espresso delve in."
Argentina,90.0,65.0,Mendoza,ZaHa,"Candied berry and sweet oak are draped all over a ripe, rich nose. This is bright, fruity and cleanly made. Flavors of blueberry and cassis run sweet and oaky, while milk chocolate and residual berry fruit push the finish. The wine balances oakiness and sweetness."
US,94.0,35.0,Adelaida District,Tablas Creek,"Roussanne is one of the more difficult grapes to get right, and these RhÃ´ne masters pulled it off this vintage with brilliance. Fascinating honey-laced melon cream and mango mochi aromas show on the dessert-like nose. The palate is bone-dry, however, with melon and honey mustard-like flavors, proving truly unique yet refreshingly delicious."
US,90.0,25.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Ampelos,"This is a light, graceful red that's stemmy and fresh in a mix of well-integrated cranberry, rhubarb and cardamom flavors. An undercurrent of earthy truffle plays on the palate, weaving its way to a long finish."
Italy,87.0,40.0,Rosso di Montalcino,Paradiso di Frassina,"This opens with a delicate fragrance of wild flower, tilled earth, red berry and sweet baking spices. The soft palate offers up dark cherry layered with hints of mocha, vanilla, mint and subtle oak. It's not an ager so enjoy soon."
Spain,88.0,36.0,CariÃ±ena,Grandes Vinos y ViÃ±edos,"A purple, saturated, well-oaked, muscular wine with heavy, dark fruit and hickory aromas. Forceful and saturated on the palate, with big blackberry flavors blanketed by powerful oak. Dark and smoky on the finish, with intensity and thick legs."
US,90.0,35.0,Carneros,Frank Family,"Caramelized oak finds a companion in tangy acidity in this full-bodied, lushly concentrated white from various vineyard sources. A taste of baked pear gives it a richness that veers on sweet upfront before it opens and expands on the palate into a broader spectrum of rounded texture and a lilt of anise."
Spain,83.0,19.0,Getariako Txakolina,Finca Jakue,"Mild, melony aromas are friendly, but in the mouth, this wine is sharp and hard-edged, with sizzling acidity. Flavors of tart, underripe peach finish with over-the-top citric acidity."
US,87.0,20.0,Russian River Valley,VML,"This is a strongly flavored blush, packing a punch of raspberry, fig, sweet tea and rose flavors. It's dry and very crisp in acidity. Give it a chill and enjoy with salted, smoked meats, or a nice fish stew."
Italy,85.0,19.0,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Canella,This opens with a slightly pungent note of ripe cantaloupe and apricot. Distant sweetness and touch of butterscotch or caramel is detected on the creamy finish.
France,83.0,25.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Moulin de Canhaut,"Dry and light, an unfocused wine. It has tannins, only light fruit, very dry and ultimately tough."
France,90.0,70.0,Nuits-St.-Georges,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,Nuits Saint-Georges is the home of the Aegerter family and its Domaine. This ripe spicy smoky wine is rich both from the vintage and from the core of tannins that are typical of the appellation. It is a smooth rounded wine although it will need some aging. Drink from 2020.
Italy,88.0,36.0,Chianti Classico,Lornano,"Aromas of blackcurrant, spice, menthol, espresso and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose. The round, chewy palate doles out blackberry jam, licorice, ground black pepper and coffee alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's evolving quickly so enjoy sooner rather than later."
France,87.0,25.0,Minervois,ChÃ¢teau Cabezac,"A slightly herbal edge and floral notes mingle with the dark berry and cherry aromas. Hints of tobacco and soft sweet spice add depth to the mouth, which is otherwise bright and vibrant but also straightforward. Drink now."
US,93.0,40.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Morgan,"Pepper, acidity and tannins are the stars of this young, unresolved Syrah. Under all that is a solid core of blackberries and blueberries that have a slight baked quality, like fruit in a pie. The wine needs time to knit together. A blend mainly of Morgan's cool Double L Vineyard and the fine Paraiso Vineyard, at the warmer, opposite end of the appellation, it should hit its stride in mid-2009."
US,87.0,28.0,Los Carneros,Gibbs,"Perfumed, bold and brambly, this is a full-bodied and fairly-priced rendition of the variety that's big in cherry cola flavor, earthy mint and oak."
Italy,96.0,280.0,Toscana,Tenuta di Biserno,"From the coastal Tuscan estate of Lodovico Antinori (brother of Piero), here comes a gorgeous blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot and a small percentage of Petit Verdot. Soft chocolate and black cherry opens the nose and segues to enormous richness and length. The wine is excellent but the jury is out on whether it becomes one of the great cult classics of Italy. Hold 10??0 years."
US,87.0,36.0,Napa Valley,Fontanella,"Sweet and candied, this Zin, which is a blend of Mount Veeder and Oakville fruit, is obviously superripe in blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and dusty baking spices. It's sweet in fruity essence but nicely dry on the finish. Drink now with barbecue, baked ham, soft cheeses."
US,90.0,32.0,Napa Valley,Yao Family Wines,"Grapes are sourced from St. Helena and Oakville for this light-bodied, tart and slightly herbal wine, blended with 8% SÃ©millon. Ripe and round, it's both floral and fruity, highlighted by melon and pear."
US,83.0,10.0,California,Cable Car,"A soft, simple, fruity Merlot. Tastes like a cherry, blackberry, roasted almond, cocoa and cinnamon granola bar, melted into wine."
France,92.0,75.0,Champagne,Charles Heidsieck,"The aromas are of smoky bottle age and this translates into the flavors, with a light rancio character giving complexity to a finely made, rich, raspberry-flavored wine. It is full-bodied in the Charles Heidsieck style, a definite food wine."
US,93.0,50.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Lutum,"This first showing of the new soil-focused partnership between vintner Bill Price and winemaker Gavin Chanin promises great things. Aromas of cardamom, raspberry, violet, black pepper and herbes de Provence give way to a herbal palate of oregano, thyme, dried basil and sage that give lift to the sour-cherry fruit."
US,85.0,20.0,Carneros,Gloria Ferrer,"This seemingly sweet wine shows lots of ripe, rich raspberries and vanilla, with a nice yeasty doughiness. Yet there's good acidity, and the finish is very clean."
US,85.0,10.0,California,Bogle,"Very pungent in gooseberry aromas, this ultra-dry wine is crisp in mouthwatering acidity. The flavors are of grapefruits, orange rind, vanilla and spice."
France,88.0,22.0,Gigondas,Louis Bernard,"This attractively priced Gigondas is a solid example, boasting traditional notes of leather and spiced meat. It's supple and slightly warm, with modest cherry fruit coated with a dusting of dry red earth. Clove and metallic notes on the finish suggest early consumption is the prudent option."
Argentina,82.0,11.0,Mendoza,Trivento,"While this opens with harmless aromas of lychee and tropical fruits, the palate sizzles with sharp citric acidity. Flavors of pithy grapefruit and tangerine finish grabby, tart and aggressive. This is not nearly as good as the two prior vintages."
Spain,89.0,37.0,Rioja,Alberto Orte,"This blend of 75% Garnacha, 20% Tempranillo and 5% Viura opens with oaky aromas of cigar box, floral notes and raisin. A snappy, fresh palate reflects high elevation and a north-facing vineyard exposure, while this tastes oaky and of herbal currant and raspberry. A spicy finish of dried red-fruit notes and a saucy snap fits into the traditional mode for Rioja. Drink through 2021."
France,91.0,40.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau de Ribebon,"The wine, from one of the five Aubert family properties, is rich and full of great fruit. With ripe tannins and blackberry generosity over the wood aging, this is still structured yet ready to drink."
US,93.0,44.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Samuel Louis Smith,"Vinified by the former Margerum winemaker (who now works for Morgan Winery), this bottling from one of the appellation's most exciting vineyards is chock-full of baked red cherry, vanilla, clove and gravel aromas. Though light and bright in body, the palate packs intriguing flavors, from raspberry and rose petal to dried fennel and dill."
US,90.0,20.0,Dry Creek Valley,Fritz,"Much improved over the unripe 2005, Fritz's 2006 is quite a delicious and sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc. Partially barrel fermented and with some Musque clone for complexity, it's richly textured and creamy, with a mÃ©lange of pineapple, Meyer lemon, Asian pear, lychee, fig and dusty spice flavors."
US,89.0,65.0,Paso Robles,LXV,"Though reserved on the nose at first, this bottling begins to show dense blueberry, coffee and soy with patience. There are boisterous flavors of squeezed elderberry and blackberry fruit once sipped, along with beef char, black coffee, dark chocolate and purple flowers on the finish. This still needs a little time to open, but shows lots of potential."
US,87.0,19.0,Napa-Sonoma,X,"Dry, rich and balanced, with dusty tannins and balanced currant, blackberry and oak flavors. A nice, versatile Cabernet with plenty of fanciness that won't break the bank."
US,93.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Novelty Hill,"A dark and spicy wine, with streaks of mineral and herb buried within very tart, acidic black fruit. This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle. Tasted over many hours after being decanted, it showed itself to be a wonderful wine that developed multiple layers of flavor."
US,89.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Longboard,"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity."
US,91.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Volker Eisele Family Estate,"Made from a third each of co-fermented Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, all from the family estate, this is a dense, lovely wine, rich in red fruit, chocolate, clove and cedar, with a generosity of tannin that suggests aging. Drink now through 2020."
US,94.0,47.0,Russian River Valley,Paul Hobbs,"A first-rate Chardonnay, solidly exhibiting the house style of dry, elegant complexity. It's the most Chablisian of Hobbs' recent vintages, with brilliant acidity and minerality giving the tropical fruit and oak flavors a stony grounding. It would not be surprising if this wine ages well for six years or so."
US,90.0,15.0,Mendocino County,Graziano,"A fresh green-apple aroma and vivid citrus and crisp apple flavors are supported by vibrant acidity in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is smooth but crisp, making lots of good food pairings come to mind, from pre-meal cheese, to salads, seafood and veggie pastas."
US,83.0,11.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Castle Rock,"Quite tannic and herbal, this is no match for the previous vintage. Barely ripe, with a bitter edge to the finish."
Italy,88.0,30.0,Campi Flegrei,La Sibilla,"This wine opens with aromas of beeswax, white flower, acacia, lemon drop and smoky mineral. The savory palate delivers lemon zest, grapefruit and yellow peach accented with thyme, rosemary and mineral."
Italy,90.0,80.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Mastrojanni,"Brunello Mastrojanni is always a highlight among the various wines from Montalcino. Bright and elegant, it shows aromas of cherry, cola, ginger, dried spice, leather and spice. The mouthfeel is lean and tight with crisp acidity and firm, polished tannins."
US,87.0,27.0,Finger Lakes,Heart & Hands,"Fleshy stone fruit and waxy orange rind aromas introduce a dry, intensely minerally palate that rippples with lemon-lime acidity. Flavors of tart pineapple, citrus and fennel frond linger on the finish."
US,85.0,43.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cave B,"Much like the other 2011 red wine releases from Cave B, this offers thin, tart red fruit, and strong herb and stem flavors in the finishing tannins."
US,86.0,30.0,El Dorado,Lava Cap,"A compellingly fresh herbal component characterizes this wine, particularly in the aroma. Still-tight tannins give a bitter note. Soft and ripe in blackberry and black licorice, it's a wine to enjoy now with a grilled steak dotted in peppercorns."
France,89.0,30.0,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes,"Both opulence and decadence are evident on the fleshy, peachy nose. The palate presents brighter, fresher peach and yellow plum fruit but has the sweetness of bitter honey. An intriguing and heady mix."
Spain,84.0,22.0,Alella,RaventÃ³s de Alella,"This linear wine's neutral aromas vaguely resemble peach and peach pit. Its yeasty, leesy, oxidized white fruit and white bread flavors finish on a melony note but with little intensity."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Colli di Conegliano,Astoria,"Here is a friendly, oak-aged blend with aromas of peach, vanilla, exotic fruit and butterscotch. The wine is luminous and bright and its soft, silky texture would work nicely with simple chicken or pan-fried fish in butter sauce."
US,90.0,20.0,Mendocino,Navarro,"This is an excellent rosÃ© with some red-wine character showing through the pale-salmon color and fresh fruitiness. It has slightly meaty, spicy and cherry-like flavors, a good balance between medium body and firm acidity, and a nice tangy finish."
Italy,85.0,16.0,Soave,Fattori,"Delicate spring wildflower and orchard fruit aromas lift out of the glass. The simple, diluted palate mirrors the nose, offering hints of pear and peach, with zesty acidity."
France,88.0,17.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Lieujean,"Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood."
US,89.0,20.0,Finger Lakes,Heron Hill,"Strikingly aromatic of plums, briar and menthol, this is a brisk, elegant Pinot Noir with concentrated but crisp red-fruit flavors. Tones of granite and penetrating, velvety tannins add structure and style."
Italy,86.0,23.0,Dolcetto d'Alba,Conterno Fantino,"Bricco Bastia offers an inky, dense expression of Dolcetto with loads of dark fruit, cherry and blueberry intensity. There are also mineral notes in there and the close is slightly vinous, chewy and raw."
US,84.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Merriam,"Light in color, this sparkling wine is somewhat diluted in flavor, coming off as slightly sweet, with a nutty metallic edge to it."
US,89.0,40.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Rusack,"Violets and rose petals lead the nose, followed by ripe blackberries and, with a bit of patience, some warm pie crust. The flavors are pleasant but hard to pin down, with flashes of licorice, red currant, allspice and orange peel."
US,87.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Kings Ridge,"Juicy acids brighten up the mouthfeel, with pineapple, citrus and black-cherry-cola flavors commingling. This was aged nine months in 20% new French barrels."
US,91.0,34.0,Russian River Valley,Peter Paul Wines,"Soft, silky and exuberant in floral aromas, this earthy, dry, lush and easy wine comes from the Anderson-Ross Vineyard along the Russian River Valley road named for its famous apples. Orange blossom, tea and dark berries dominate luxuriously."
US,85.0,9.0,California,Bella Ragazza,"On the sugary side, with sweetened pineapple, green apple and peach flavors that are brightened with crisp acidity. If you like your white wines on the sweet side, this is a good price."
France,89.0,15.0,Cahors,Jean-Luc BaldÃ¨s,"From a small property next to Jean-Luc BaldÃ¨s's Clos Triguedina, Labrande produces a firm while accessible Malbec. It has richness, solid tannins, dark coffee and blueberry flavors. The end shows density and medium-term aging potential."
France,87.0,250.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Domaine du Pegau,"Equal parts Clairette, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne, this is vinified in a combination of concrete eggs, stainless-steel tanks and oak barrels. Pineapple and melon aromas and flavors dominate this warm, broad wine, picking up a slightly bitter edge on the finish."
US,84.0,22.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Coquelicot,"With apricot and citrus flavors, this Riesling tastes off-dry, with a honeyed sweetness. It's a little green around the edges, which detracts from the pleasure."
France,84.0,16.0,RosÃ© d'Anjou,ChÃ¢teau de Fesles,"With some weight, this has raspberry flavor to go with its sweetness. Berry fruits dominate in a wine that is full in the mouth."
US,84.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,MAD Wines,"Bright in acidity, which gives it a mouthwatering vitality. It's also a little ripe with Meyer lemon fruit. The result is sweet-and-sour, with the finish turning sugary."
Spain,86.0,9.0,Jumilla,Bodegas LuzÃ³n,"Gamey notes with red berry aromas set up a big, burly, tannic palate. This Monastrell-Syrah blend deals medicinal plum and berry flavors that come with a mildly salty aftertaste. This is drying and lightly herbal on the finish."
Australia,89.0,16.0,Margaret River,Xanadu,"This is a fine value in weeknight Cabernet, showing supple tannins, regionally distinct aromas and flavors of currants, sage and bay leaf, and subtle oak. Drink this fruit-driven, silky wine through 2020."
Argentina,87.0,12.0,Uco Valley,Menduco,"A touch rubbery and medicinal if you get deep into the bouquet, with sizable berry aromas to boot. The palate is comfortable and balanced, with earthy black fruit flavors that suggest fig and blackberry. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish."
US,89.0,13.0,California,ChÃ¢teau Souverain,"Jammy fruit aromas and flavors and a lack of overt oak notes make this full-bodied wine easy to love. It's simply yummy in flavor, polished in texture, and has a nice, lingering ripe fruit finish."
US,92.0,32.0,Calistoga,Summers,"This is a rich, well-structured Cabernet, but such are the tannins that it needs time in the cellar. The cool vintage was kind to the Calistoga fruit, keeping the alcohol modest and the tannins hefty, while allowing the grapes to develop intense flavors of blackberry and black currant. Give it 6?? years in a good cellar."
France,89.0,63.0,Champagne,Bertrand-Delespierre,"Definitely mature, this is a ripe wine with rich tropical flavors that give balance to the beginnings of toastiness. An attractive tang of acidity contrasts with the soft, ripe aftertaste. The wine will age further, although it is ready to drink now and until 2018."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Rioja,LoriÃ±on,"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing."
US,91.0,28.0,Dundee Hills,Stoller,"Lush and aromatic, with ripe pear and melon fruit, sweet spices and a streak of vanilla. The 20% new oak seems just right, and the flavors persist through a seductively long finish."
US,85.0,28.0,Dry Creek Valley,Quivira,"This barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc will appeal to fans of oak. It's strong in charry, caramelized, buttered toast flavors that dominate the underlying wine, and make it taste a little sweet."
US,83.0,28.0,Amador County,Deaver,"This high-alcohol mountain Zin seems to have already lost its zip, dominated by a raisiny overripeness that skirts dangerously into syrup land."
US,86.0,36.0,Russian River Valley,Alysian,"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay is heavy in oak, with ripe, jammy orange, pineapple and creamy lees flavors. It's a good wine, if not particularly subtle or complex."
US,86.0,15.0,Lodi,Cosentino,"This is a full-bodied and intensely fruity wine with jammy aromas and ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. It is smooth textured and has soft tannins, so the effect is easygoing in spite of high alcohol."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Prosecco Treviso,La Tordera,"Aromas and flavors of green apple, pear and a hint of citrus drop come together on this bright easygoing sparkler. Lively acidity keeps it fresh."
US,87.0,24.0,Monticello,Trump,"The nose screams Viognier, with aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, white flowers and powdered candy necklace. A peaches-and-cream palate feels lush and viscous, yet the acid manages to keep things lively through the fuzzy-textured finish."
US,91.0,24.0,Lodi,Markus Wine Co,"This dry, fruity wine made from Germanic grape varieties gains extra richness in mouthfeel and body due to being fermented in 60% new barrels. It has ripe apple and peach notes and buttery, toasty accents that add interest and complexity."
US,89.0,43.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Baer,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend, 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc and Merlot filling it out. All the fruit comes from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard. The initial aromas are dominated with sweet, toasty, pretty new French oak, with the irresistible flavors of mocha following. As good as it is, the fruit seems light and submerged, with little depth. This is a wine to enjoy in its youth."
France,87.0,52.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,Paul Jaboulet AÃ®nÃ©,"Despite only 15% new oak, this wine comes across as toasty and caramelly, with delicate touches of pear, honey and wet stones. There's plenty of weight and length, so fans of oaked whites will find plenty to like."
France,90.0,112.0,Chassagne-Montrachet,Joseph Faiveley,"At this stage, this wine is closed and packed with acidity. But just wait for a few years and the ripe wood and yellow fruits will emerge. It's a full-bodied, rich wine that needs to round out. Drink from 2016."
US,92.0,50.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Northstar,"This wine is still in its shell, with notes of dark raspberries, cocoa and barrel spices. It's lusciously rich, dense and layered with firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften. Just a baby now, it will be best from 2017 on."
France,87.0,20.0,Brouilly,Georges Duboeuf,"This grand estate was once a hunting ground for an even grander nearby chateau. The cru wine that's now produced here is crisp and fruity, streaked through with acidity and red currants. It has a touch of tannin as well as minerality. Drink from late 2017."
Spain,86.0,15.0,Costers del Segre,Clos Pons,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are also stalky and gamy, a likely reflection of the 75% Syrah in this blend with Garnacha. A hard, grabby palate holds flavors of herbal plum and grape skins, while an obtuse finish tastes a little green."
Argentina,93.0,50.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Like almost every wine in Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec series, Ambrosia is concentrated and deep, with potent aromas of wood smoke, lemon peel, blackberry and tar. This feels layered and plush, while flavors of wild berry, dark spices, coffee and mocha finish with a blast of chocolate and nutmeg. Drink through 2018."
US,86.0,32.0,Eola-Amity Hills,Hawkins Cellars,"The back label notes that this is the winery's reserve, sourced from Methven Family vineyards. It shows cranberry and blue-plum fruit of moderate ripeness, feeling a bit flat in the mouth. A year in 50% new French oak adds a touch of toastiness."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Nebbiolo d'Alba,Giacomo Fenocchio,"This is a quintessential expression of young Nebbiolo, with pretty floral and strawberry notes that carry onto the palate, along with raspberry and mineral nuances and a whiff of spice. A bright, elegant wine made to be drunk young. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co."
US,82.0,25.0,Napa County,Orpheus,"Half Merlot, the rest a mix of Petite Sirah and Syrah, this has a bell pepper and jalapeÃ±o greenness that can't be avoided in aroma or taste. From there, the wine seems diluted yet finishes with a hit of heat."
Spain,83.0,10.0,Campo de Borja,Coto de Hayas,"Bramble and burning brush on the nose, while the palate is murky as it delivers tomato leaf, baked plum and carob flavors. Seems sort of cooked and funky, with a muddled mouthfeel. The 2005 is a cleaner, more focused wine."
Italy,85.0,18.0,Sicilia,Morgante,"This Nero d'Avola opens with aromas of burned rubber and ripe black fruit. The palate shows dense blackberry extract along with espresso, toasted flavors and very evident alcohol. It finishes on an astringent, drying note of wood."
US,90.0,13.0,Columbia Valley (WA),The Winemaker's Loft,"A blend of 60% Cabernet, 20% Merlot, 18% Syrah and splashes of Malbec, Zinfandel and Tempranillo, this spicy and toasty red wine shows the care that went into the original barrels, which were never intended for this inexpensive tasting room red. The fruit is juicy and bursting with bright sweet berry flavors, and the generous oak adds cinnamon and butterscotch."
France,87.0,14.0,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,Ravoire et Fils,"With a typical Coteaux d'Aix blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, this is fruity while also textured and aromatic. It has a good concentration, minerality and a rich, red-fruited aftertaste."
US,82.0,22.0,California,Rock Wall,"Thin in structure, with simple, sweet jam and herb flavors, this Tannat has strong tannins and acids."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Alto Adige,Egger-Ramer,"Aromas of red berry and wildflower take shape in the glass. The bright palate offers wild cherry, strawberry and a hint of almond alongside vibrant acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy soon."
France,82.0,28.0,Chablis,Domaine Faiveley,This is a yeasty wine that shows a bitter almond character. It has an unattractive hard edge.
Italy,88.0,21.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"Here is a wonderful example of Sauvignon Blanc from Northern Italy at its most aromatic and fragrant. The wine boasts pristine notes of sage leaf, kiwi and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is firm, tonic and compact."
US,89.0,17.0,Mendocino,Patianna,"Tremendously pretty with honeysuckle and apricot highlights and memorable texture as well as a bright, crisp finish, this Chardonnay makes for a very good food wine, its cool-climate grapes grown organically along the banks of the Russian River."
Spain,86.0,13.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Legado MuÃ±oz,"Blackberry and other fruits are presented clearly on the nose, while the rubbery, bouncy palate seems properly tight and balanced. Sweet, stretched-out flavors of black plum and berry are warm and youthful. Good for basic drinking."
Italy,88.0,45.0,Chianti Classico,Poggio Borgoni,"Baked plum, truffle and mocha aromas emerge on this blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The warm, chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, coffee, vanilla and anise alongside brooding tannins. Drink through 2018."
US,91.0,27.0,Lodi,Paskett,"Apricot, peach, orange blossom and honey flavors all come together in this ultrasmooth, ripe but well-balanced wine. Zingy acidity blends with the rich fruitiness to keep it lively and refreshing, even while the viscosity coats the palate."
US,87.0,60.0,Paso Robles,Star Angel by Montes,"A RhÃ´ne-style blend that's rich in cola, blackberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The tannins are fine and ripe, while acidity is on the soft side, giving the wine a certain directness. Yet it's nicely dry and clean. Drink now."
US,90.0,15.0,Finger Lakes,Dr. Konstantin Frank,"The historic Dr. Konstantin Frank winery has long been a source for consistent, well-priced wines in the Finger Lakes. Pretty on the nose, with delicate floral and stone-fruit aromas, it builds in intensity and power on the palate, with a crush of sweet-tart grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Hints of fresh herb, honeycomb and zippy lemon-lime acidity add nuance and balance to a long finish."
US,92.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Goat Bubbles,"A pleasant rose-petal pink in color, this wine by regional sparkling veteran Norm Yost shows red-grapefruit pulp and skin, lime spritz and a shred of bubble gum on the nose, playing both on hedonism and restraint. It's extremely refreshing once sipped, with more lime and pink grapefruit zest."
US,90.0,20.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Soos Creek,"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish."
France,89.0,18.0,Limoux,ChÃ¢teau Rives-Blanques,"A blend of 60% Chardonnay, 30% Chenin Blanc and 10% Mauzac, this is a bright and lively white, with attractive aromas of white flower, clover, pear flesh and lightly grilled peach. The medium-weight palate is remarkably balanced, with ample acidity to lift the ripe apple, pear and citrus flavors, finishing with a kiss of sweet spice."
Italy,92.0,60.0,Amarone della Valpolicella,Accordini Igino,"This dense and concentrated Amarone offers an intense bouquet of marinated cherry, blackberry and tobacco. The palate delivers rich flavors of blackberry, prune, licorice and a touch of carob, along with round tannins and soft acidity. It has layers of flavor and nice depth. Drink through 2017."
Canada,91.0,25.0,Okanagan Valley,Tantalus Vineyards,"This Riesling specialist strikes a unique chord, with precise yet individualistic wines. Crisp, tart, tongue-tickling flavors of green apple, grapefruit and orange peel are among the penetrating highlights. Concentrated and high in acid, this rocks on through a long finish."
Italy,90.0,30.0,Bolgheri,Campo alla Sughera,"Dark ruby color in color, this Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend opens with bright tones of forest fruit, lead pencil, cola and crushed mineral. It is bright and firm, with a polished, dusty mouthfeel."
US,91.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Clos SolÃ¨ne,"Simultaneously light, vivacious and flavor-packed, this bottling is a lightly faded shade of pink in the glass, and shows delicate bubble gum, sliced watermelon, pink rose buds and a squeeze of lime on the nose. The blend of 45% Grenache, 30% MourvÃ¨dre and 25% Syrah offers zesty acidity and a pithy texture on the palate, with bright tangerine, lemon pith and a touch of strawberry fruit."
US,86.0,14.0,Mendocino County,Bonterra,"Made from organically grown grapes, this Chardonnay imparts a taste of beeswax and lemon. It's robust in acidity and structured with a sizeable finish. Small percentages of Muscat, Viognier and Riesling are mingled in."
US,86.0,29.0,Middleburg,Three Fox,"Scents of thyme, tar, date and ripe strawberry lead onto the open-textured palate. Medium in length, the finish comes with fine-grain tannins and balanced acids."
Spain,88.0,20.0,Rueda,ViÃ±a Mayor,"Aromas of wood grain, minerals and apple set up a creamy, plump palate with leesy apple, pear and melon flavors. This barrel-fermented Verdejo is mild, creamy, leesy and steady on the finish, which holds form and doesn't break up."
US,92.0,29.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Barrister,"The flagship bottling for this winery, this brings aromas of dried herbs, dark chocolate, espresso bean, black currant and cherry. The dark fruit flavors are rich and concentrated, possessing a layered mouthfeel that captures the attention."
US,91.0,38.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Nodland,"This rich, dark and earthy wine is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, done well and designed to appeal to those who favor dark barrel flavors along with their ripe fruit. Here, the flavors begins at licorice and runs through espresso, cacao and a finish of lightly charred tannins."
US,88.0,55.0,Contra Costa County,Rock Wall,"A smoky, charred oak aroma leads the nose of this full-bodied, high-octane and appropriately tannic wine, and vivid, peppery notes jazz up its solid fruit flavors."
US,91.0,22.0,Central Coast,Los Padres,"Especially for a more affordable bottling, Joey Tensley packs in a ton of density on this bottling, from the color to the nose to the palate. Hearty aromas of black currant, charred blackberry, dusty sagebrush and a hint of caramel drop into a deep and rich but not overripe palate of tar and blackened fruit. Soft tannins coat the mouth fully."
US,86.0,30.0,North Fork of Long Island,Comtesse ThÃ©rÃ¨se,"Layers of char, black pepper and briar patch help to build complexity in this dense, concentrated black plum Merlot. There's a touch of green leaf and tomato throughout, but overall, it's a fruit-driven, luscious wine accented with spice and smooth, supple tannins. Aged 24 months in new French oak."
US,88.0,40.0,Livermore Valley,Fenestra,"Opening with a mouthful of dusty raspberry and cherry flavors, this Bordeaux blend of a little more than half Cabernet Sauvignon and smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers much in the way of inviting fruit and spice notes. Its pleasing acidity lasts through the finish."
US,87.0,10.0,Washington,14 Hands,"Aromas of pear, cantaloupe and apple are followed by broad, dry fruit flavors, with a spritzy finish. There's not much complexity, but the wine goes down easy and is very varietal."
France,92.0,25.0,Cahors,Georges Vigouroux,"The flagship estate of the Vigouroux family, this medieval castle on a hill is also a hotel. The vineyard produces powerful wines like this, packed with dusty tannins and with dark berry fruits and fine concentration. It is a wine to age, drink from 2020."
US,86.0,22.0,Napa Valley,Peju,"This is a sound Sauvignon Blanc, with plenty of varietal character. It's tastes of honey, grass and citrus flavors that are highlighted by brisk acidity."
Spain,90.0,21.0,Rioja,Beronia,"Smoky, oaky, charred flavors of savory plum and berry lead to a full, layered palate with slightly abrasive tannins. This tastes of grilled beef, lemon peel, toast, cassis and chocolate. A toasted character remains on a solid finish. Drink through 2020."
Italy,89.0,26.0,Chianti Classico,Felsina,"This wine has an intriguing fragrance of dill, violet, black fruit, white pepper and new oak. The palate is still rather closed, but reveals ripe black cherry notes alongside hints of well-integrated oak and mint. It has elegant tannins and ample length to the finish."
US,84.0,22.0,Dry Creek Valley,Mazzocco,"Muted, with a strong suggestion of chocolate and mocha, this is thin, indistinguishable red."
Spain,84.0,28.0,Vino da Mesa de Toledo,Marques de GriÃ±on,"This bears some similarities to its Petit Verdot sibling reviewed here, but is not as well-realized. The red berry fruit wears a hint of sourness, showing a green, under-ripe quality that detracts. It's slightly weightier than its stable-mate, but lags behind it in flavor and finesse. ?M.M."
Spain,85.0,11.0,Rioja,Bodega Classica,"Slightly grassy aromas of melon and stone fruits lead to a tangy, citrusy palate. This tastes a touch bready and like a peach pit, while the finish follows suit with pithy bitterness."
US,86.0,34.0,El Dorado,David Girard,"Oaky and earthy, this estate MourvÃ¨dre is on the savory side of things, ripe in stewed plums, tobacco and black pepper, linear and soft. Barrel-aged for a year in French oak, 20% of it new, the wine's oak imprint should continue to mellow with time."
US,94.0,85.0,Napa Valley,Pahlmeyer,"The wine launched cinematically by Robert Redford in ?Indecent Proposal,??this delivers a succulently memorable and seductive mix of crisp cassis and meaty rare beef, a sanguine underpinning that gives it intrigue. Full bodied and ripely crafted, it is completely satisfying in its classical components of sage and cedar, with a lingering lust of chocolate-covered cherry."
US,84.0,15.0,Sonoma Coast,Cline,"Dark color and a punch of smoky oak underline this wine's big burly hold of tannin and ripe fruit. Tobacco, tar and baked cherry highlight the flavor wheel."
US,92.0,60.0,Livermore Valley,Steven Kent,"A beautiful, complex and upscale Cabernet to drink now, after a good decant. It's bone dry and a little soft, with intricately layered blackberry, black currant and oak flavors. Feels lush and important in the mouth, and the spicy finish lasts for a long time."
Spain,85.0,12.0,Cava,Freixenet,"Lime, apple and iodine aromas are the opening act for a low-acid, powdery palate with mealy green-fruit flavors. Briny notes of pickled cucumber and lettuce drive the finish alongside lemon-lime notes."
France,87.0,60.0,Champagne,Collet,"This is a ripe, dry style of rosÃ©. It has a dense texture that is rich with strawberry fruits as well as good acidity and a balanced tangy texture of peeled oranges. The wine is fresh, full of fruit and ready to drink."
US,91.0,50.0,Chehalem Mountains,Lachini,"The ripe cherry fruit carries highlights of orange peel, herbes de Provence and Orange Pekoe tea. At first tannic and drying, the wine opens into a more giving, tongue-coating style. Slight bitterness may be a function of its youth, as the overall balance and complexity suggests it will improve with some additional bottle age. Drink 2018??025."
US,90.0,18.0,Rogue Valley,RoxyAnn,"Made from 75% Syrah with the rest Malbec and a smidgeon of Cabernet Sauvignon, it brings notes of dried cherry, vanilla and barrel spices. The palate is luscious and rich with abundant cherry flavors and barrel accents leading to a cranberry-filled finish."
France,87.0,26.0,Marsannay,Louis Latour,"With some tannins and with bright red fruits, this wine is structured and has attractive acidity. A perfumed wine with a fruity future, it will be ready to drink from 2018."
Italy,88.0,27.0,Barbera d'Alba,Massolino,"Aromas of blackberry, underbrush, blue flowers and a whiff of coffee lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry and white pepper alongside firm acidity. Drink through 2016 to capture the combination of fruit and freshness."
US,82.0,11.0,California,Bogle,"A small Pinot Noir, this is dry and vegetal, with modest cherry flavors."
Italy,94.0,67.0,Trento,Maso Martis,"Linear and intense, this elegant blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay opens with aromas of fragrant flowers, yeast and a whiff of orchard fruit. The firm, focused palate delivers ripe apple, citrus zest, almond and energizing mineral notes alongside an ultrafine, persistent perlage that carries through to the quenching, bone dry finish. It's overflowing with finesse."
US,87.0,7.0,Yakima Valley,Pontin del Roza,"A nice bottle of wine, bone-dry and fragrant, with pleasing, simple flavors."
US,90.0,44.0,Sonoma County,Westwood,"Reduced on the nose, youthfully, the reduction blows away to reveal a fruity landscape of blueberry and blackberry that's ripe yet light. Spritzy acidity freshens a hearty body and supportive oak."
Italy,85.0,24.0,Collio,Tenuta Stella,"This lean, simple white offers yellow flower, citrus zest and grilled herb flavors. It's bright, with a clean finish."
US,89.0,10.0,Mendocino County,Castle Rock,"Vivid grapefruit and crisp apple notes give a big personality to this medium-bodied wine. A light sweetness takes off the acidic edge, while oaky and earthy accents linger on the finish. It's a terrific value and not hard to find."
France,89.0,15.0,Castillon CÃ´tes de Bordeaux,ChÃ¢teau d'Arce,"This wine is soft, open and full of fruit. It has a tang of acidity as well as rich berry flavors and a supporting layer of tannin. Fine, smoky and structured, it will be easy to drink from 2019."
Argentina,88.0,15.0,Valle de Uco,Zuccardi,"Macho grapy aromas are offset by spunky raspberry scents. Fruity and a bit narrow and grabby across the palate, this delivers Mendoza's patented black-fruit flavors wrapped in chocolaty oak. Spice and oak remain present on a full finish."
US,86.0,19.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Ott & Murphy,"This is a RhÃ´ne-style blend of mostly Grenache and Syrah, with smaller amounts of Viognier and Cinsault. The wine opens with appealing spices, but turns tart and stemmy in the mouth. The spiced plum fruit flavors compete somewhat unsuccessfully with bitter tannins. More bottle age should help."
US,93.0,100.0,Snipes Mountain,DeLille,"Coming from some of the oldest vines in the state, this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot is all about elegance of expression and nuance. Lighter in color, it offers aromas of raspberry, cherry, herb and graphite that lead to focused coffee, cranberry and earth flavors. The restraint and balance are pitch perfect. It will be best 2019??026."
France,89.0,80.0,Champagne,Ruinart,"This attractive wine is fresh and fruity, with raspberry flavors and a red cherry-skin edge of tannins. It is full and creamy, with a soft, ripe aftertaste. The bottling is ready to drink."

US,87.0,26.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Horan Estates,"Stiffly tannic, this is straight-on boysenberry juice, firm and full-bodied. It shows a little bit of earthiness, hints of herb and a citrusy zip to the acids. The alcohol, pushing 15%, does not intrude."
Argentina,91.0,17.0,Mendoza,Cueva de las Manos,"Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point."
US,82.0,20.0,Rogue Valley,Agate Ridge,"Barrel-fermented and pungent, with a whiff of glue, this has a simple mix of mint and wax aromas."
Italy,87.0,16.0,Alto Adige,Colterenzio,"Aromas of white spring flowers, ripe Bartlett pear and roasted almond take the lead. The juicy, round palate offers lemon pastry, juicy golden apples and a nutmeg note alongside fresh acidity. It finishes on a slightly sweet note recalling glazed brown sugar."
US,89.0,35.0,Carneros,Schug,"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced."
US,94.0,50.0,Chehalem Mountains,J. Christopher,"This is introduced by scents of rose and cherry blossoms, with a hint of butterscotch. Once tasted it's a lush, forward, sweetly appealing wine with the impressive fruit concentration of the 2012 vintage, underscored with a layer of mineral. It's delicious already, but destined to improve. Drink some now, and put away some to taste between 2018 and 2025."
Australia,91.0,21.0,McLaren Vale,Fox Creek,"Full bodied, creamy and supple, this wine offers textbook aromas of cedar, tobacco and cassis. It brightens slightly on the palate, where cherry notes join the fun, then finishes long and softly dusty. Drink now??028."
Italy,91.0,55.0,Taurasi,Di Meo,"You can't go wrong with a beautifully bold and structured red wine like this. Meant for cold winter nights and hearty meat dishes, this elegant Taurasi opens with luscious dark fruit, prune, spice and tobacco notes. The wine's texture is fine and silky, with polished, dusty tannins."
US,84.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Wolf Family,"A bit inert, with muted aromas and a heavy, tannic mouthfeel. Feels hot and peppery in the mouth. The flavors of black currants give way to a sweet vanilla, tannic finish."
Italy,88.0,103.0,Barolo,Ca'RomÃ¨,"Toast, espresso, oak and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the palate offers dried black cherry, raw cranberry, orange zest and oak. Raspy tannins leave a bracing, drying finish."
Italy,88.0,18.0,Trentino,Bottega Vinaia,"Deeply pigmented and plush, this wine opens with fruity aromas of dark berry and plum. The easy-drinking palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of licorice. Soft tannins support the juicy flavors, imparting a smooth texture and drink-now appeal."
Italy,88.0,65.0,Barolo,Sordo,"Aromas of black cherries marinated in spirits, menthol, leather and chopped herbs lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried berries, licorice, tobacco and mocha alongside the warmth of evident alcohol and jarring tannins. Give it a few years to let the tannins soften up a bit but then drink before the fruit dries up."
US,90.0,125.0,Napa Valley,Cornerstone,"This is a rich, elaborate Cabernet Sauvignon. It's opulent and flashy, with upfront blackberry jam, black currant, chocolate, spice and new oak flavors, and the tannins are ultrasmooth. Made in the soft, appealing modern style."
US,89.0,50.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Swiftwater Cellars,"A mix of Cabernet and Merlot, with small amounts of four other grapes, this is a soft red, with red and black fruit flavors. It's smooth and accessible, offering plenty of cocoa and sweet baking spice notes."
US,85.0,11.0,Finger Lakes,Casa Larga,"Fresh mint and menthol notes lend a herbaceous tone to this dry, slightly grassy Riesling. Lemon and lime flavors are brisk and clean on the palate."
US,88.0,38.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"Made from a majority of Pinot Noir grapes from several estate vineyards, as well as Chardonnay and a smidgen of Pinot Meunier, this sparkling rosÃ© offers flavors of creamy strawberry and raspberry, the fruit ripe and succulent. A medium-size body and level of acidity keeps it steady on the palate, finishing with a flash of citrus."
US,93.0,45.0,Sonoma County,Rock Wall,"This is a beautiful wine, fully expressive of the vineyard and vintage. It's showy in juicy red and black wild berries, with just-right additions of cinnamon and black pepper. Full bodied and concentrated, it remains approachable and an ideal companion to meaty fare."
US,91.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Demetria,"This eccentric Chard marches to its own beat. It's drier and more acidic than most, and the flavors offer a mÃ©lange of peaches, oranges, tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, cashews and white flowers. Yet it's delicious and compelling. Made with full-throttle techniques that include partial barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and battonage, it was bottled unfined and unfiltered. The vineyards are Sierra Madre, in the Santa Maria Valley, and Oaks Savannah, in the Santa Ynez Valley."
US,91.0,29.0,Wahluke Slope,Two Vintners,"It's hard to ignore the high alcohol listing, but the wine is so well balanced and cohesive that few would even notice. It's aromatic with notes of dried and fresh cranberries and raspberries. The palate is full bodied and rich with concentrated, pure fruit flavors."
Spain,81.0,8.0,Navarra,Bodegas San MartÃ­n,"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors. Similar on the finish. A 200,000-case product that comes across like a 200,000-case product."
US,90.0,48.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Mark Ryan,"The production of Long Haul has doubled in 2010, and vineyard sources have changed, though most remain on Red Mountain despite the Columbia Valley appellation. The Bordeaux-style blend is 61% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 9% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It has drying tannins that somewhat mask the tart berry fruit. There's more stem and earth apparent in the palate, perhaps due to the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite Bordeaux-like, in style and finish."
France,92.0,28.0,SavenniÃ¨res,Domaine des Baumard,"This is a rich, beautifully textured dry wine. It is terroir-driven, with the volcanic soil of SavenniÃ¨res underlying the tight texture. By contrast, it offers hints of honey and flavors of yellow fruits balanced with fruity lemon flavors. Drink from 2017."
US,87.0,25.0,Sonoma County,Bluenose,"Here's a good, lusty Zin that has real Sonoma character. It's dry and rich in tannins, with exuberant flavors of wild forest berries, mocha, leather, dusty spices and sandalwood."
Argentina,84.0,10.0,Argentina,Trapiche,"Full of red-fruit aromas, particularly plum and cherry. Feels raw, with wild berry, ample oak and a lot of acid-based tang to the palate. Lightly toasty, with a mild cherry flavor to the finish."
US,93.0,45.0,Russian River Valley,Joseph Swan Vineyards,"As delicious as its 2012 counterpart, yet needing more time, this vineyard-designate shines in high acidity and swirls of lemon and tangerine, remaining balanced in weight and volume in body and structure. With suggestions of ginger throughout, it finishes briny."
Italy,89.0,14.0,Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,Tenuta di Tavignano,"Aromas of yellow stone fruit and Spanish broom lead the nose while the juicy palate offers mature yellow peach, citrus, pineapple and a hint of almond. Bright acidity provides balance and a crisp finish."
France,86.0,23.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Rimauresq,Raspberry and earth tones open this medium-weight Provence blend. There's cherry fruit and a moderate level of complexity on the palate but also a slightly funky note in the background. Tannins are forceful but polite; try with pork roast.
US,92.0,55.0,Green Valley,Dutton-Goldfield,"From a site composed of sandy Goldridge soil, this white is tremendously floral, showing off the GewÃ¼rztraminer-like flamboyance of the musquÃ© clone. It's equally exotic on the palate, its dense, gravelly texture offset by vibrant acidity, needing a swirl or two in the glass to resolve."
US,85.0,16.0,Monterey County,Irony,"This Pinot Noir shows tart, Monterey-derived acidity, but it has enough raspberry and cherry flavors to make it enjoyable. It feels light and silky."
Italy,88.0,17.0,Barbera d'Alba,Marchesi di Barolo,"This leads with violet, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas while red cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors mark the savory palate. Smooth tannins and bracing acidity provide balance. Enjoy through 2020."
Italy,87.0,32.0,Roero,Giovanni Almondo,"The aromas are tight and nervous with notes of wild berry, ginger and licorice. It is firmly astringent, so give it a few more years to help soften the tannins."
US,83.0,15.0,El Dorado,Perry Creek,"Hot and harsh, with semi-sweet flavors of black currants, chocolate and pepper. Drink this rustic wine with barbecue."
US,87.0,13.0,Oregon,A to Z,"Lightly scented with melon, white peach and nectarines, this elegant Pinot Blanc has retained its bright acidity, wrapping it around the fresh, tangy fruit flavors. It is perfectly balanced and just slightly sweet, from fruit more than sugar. A lovely apÃ©ritif, it finishes lightly spicy with flavors of fresh cut pear."
US,85.0,25.0,Napa County,Oberon,"At two years of age, this Cabernet is ready to drink now. It's bone dry, full-bodied and tannic, with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors."
US,89.0,30.0,Lake County,Schug,"Cold-fermented in stainless steel after being harvested at 31.4 degrees Brix, this Late-Harvest Riesling is ripe in apple and honey, with a sustained level of rich earth notes from the 134 g/L residual sugar. Crisp and light, it's balanced and ideal for after-dinner cheeses or poached pears."
US,87.0,25.0,Spring Mountain District,Publix,"This Cabernet shows its Spring Mountain terroir in the big-time tannins and concentration of black currant fruit. It's almost a wine-reduction sauce, but there's a loss of weight on the midpalate that suggests this isn't a wine to cellar, but to enjoy now."
US,91.0,39.0,Santa Lucia Highlands,Testarossa,"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity."
France,87.0,13.0,Bordeaux Blanc,ChÃ¢teau de ParenchÃ¨re,"On the eastern end of the Bordeaux appellation, this Gazaniol property reserves 10 of 161 acres for its white blend. This is a ripe, soft wine that is rounded with peach and red-apple fruit flavors. Crisp acidity gives it some tightness to balance the full, fruity character of the wine. Drink now."
France,87.0,18.0,Savoie,Jean Perrier et Fils,"This creamy white is soft and smooth, with just the right kick of acidity at the end. Delicious and perfumed, it's ready to drink now."
US,85.0,13.0,Central Coast,Blackburn Wine Company,Black plum and black-cherry flavors are prominent but not too deep on the nose of this bottling. There is noticeable grip on the palate with flavors of black cherry and sagebrush.
US,84.0,26.0,Paso Robles,Bianchi,"Dry and fiercely tannic, this Petite Sirah's rustic nature shows in the astringency and uneven ripeness of flavors. Shows a spectrum of blackberries, raisins and wintergreen. Drink now."
Italy,87.0,26.0,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,Santa Sofia,"Aged in large oak casks, this fresh Ripasso makes good use of minimal wood intervention that comes forth as light spice and cinnamon. The core of this wine, however, consists of pulsing black fruit and mature cherry."
France,85.0,14.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Remy-Pannier,"Fruity and tangy, this is a light and fresh wine. It has crisp green apples patterned with citrus fruits and a tight, bright texture. Ready to drink."
US,92.0,47.0,Rockpile,Mauritson,"). Very good wine from a winery increasingly known for its red varieties, and one of the best Cabernets ever to hail from this appellation. It shows a dry, distinguished tannin structure and the concentration of flavors typical of this warm, low-yielding region, with black currant intensity. Give it a decant and drink over the next six years."
France,94.0,58.0,Champagne,Lelarge-Pugeot,"The 2002 vintage Champagnes showcase a truly great year. This wine is no exception. It's very dry, but rich in character, with pristine citrus, apple and plum flavors balanced by hints of toast and maturity. It could improve with age, but it's good to drink now."
US,90.0,65.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Ã Maurice,"The aromas of dried flowers and green herbs have yet to fully blossom, seeming light and elusive, with green pepper providing accents. The blackberry and black currant flavors are light and layered, with well-balanced tannins and an extended finish."
Italy,92.0,18.0,Verdicchio di Matelica,ColleStefano,"From one of the top estates in the Matelica denomination and made from organically farmed grapes, this stunning wine offers a beautiful bouquet of acacia flowers, beeswax and stone fruit. The palate delivers flavors of creamy white peach, apricot and pear, all accented by aromatic herbs and mineral tones. Delicious now, with crisp acidity, this will develop complexity over the next few years."
France,86.0,45.0,MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Moulin de Canhaut,"The aromas and flavors of new wood are dominant in this soft, ripe wine. It has opulent black-plum fruit that shows through the wood influence. A touch of smokiness adds spice."
US,85.0,48.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This Bordeaux blend has a different artist's label every year but otherwise has no identity of its own. This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply."
France,88.0,15.0,Bordeaux RosÃ©,ChÃ¢teau la VerriÃ¨re,"This delicious, crisp wine conveys a great bite of fruit and acidity. It has light tannins, tasty crushed raspberry fruits and lively acidity at the end."
US,93.0,60.0,Arroyo Grande Valley,Laetitia,"Classic Laetitia, dark, dry, full-bodied and richly extracted. The cherry, persimmon and pomegranate fruit is so forward, it tastes sweet, except that the wine finishes fully dry. Acidity is evident, as are grippy tannins, and the fruit and spice finish lasts a long time. An evident ager. Best after 2013."
US,90.0,27.0,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Bella Grace,"Subtle flavors and a great sense of balance will make this low-alcohol but medium-bodied wine versatile before or during a meal. The aroma is quietly fruity and the flavors take on more shape and a little weight, showing white peach and jicama as the texture broadens from a sharp first impression to more fullness on the finish."
France,89.0,28.0,Pouilly-FuissÃ©,Louis Jadot,"With a toasty character, this is a classic of its kind, with ripe fruit and an attractive slice of lemon. A mineral edge to this spicy wine gives a fresh texture at the end. It should age a few months, so drink from 2016."
Italy,87.0,11.0,Prosecco,Val d'Oca,Delicate scents of spring flower and white peach follow through to the soft foaming palate along with green apple and a hint of candied nectarine drop. Bright acidity gives it a fresh finish.
US,88.0,24.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Mannina Cellars,"This is soft and round with pleasing flavors of black cherry and plum. Hints of coffee and chocolate do not tamper with the basic core of clean, ripe fruit. It's quite nicely made, drinking well, and comes into focus in the extended finish."
Italy,90.0,38.0,Toscana,Fattoria Sorbaiano,"This is modern and lush without being too obvious or cloying. In fact, it is nicely balanced, harmonious and very enjoyable. It has gorgeous intensity and balance between fruit and wood with good length on the finish."
US,91.0,36.0,Santa Barbara County,Fess Parker,"This nose from the actor-turned-vintner's family vineyard shows tight aromas of chalk, rain on cement and lime pith and blossoms. The laser-focused palate holds to the lime-pith lead, also showing ruby-red grapefruit juice, but exercising a lot of clean restraint."
Italy,90.0,45.0,Barbaresco,Rivetti Massimo,"You could describe this wine as linear and elongated. Everything about it seems to suggest length and longevity including its well-chiseled aromas of graphite, charcoal mineral, tar, licorice and black currant. It offers ash and smoke in the mouth but is not flat or tired. In fact, it tastes succulent, austere and important."
US,85.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Crest,"At first sharp and focused, with sharp aromas of pine and citrus rind, this broadens out and thins quickly once in the mouth. Fresh green apple fruit fades into a smooth, plain, slightly watery finish."
US,86.0,17.0,California,Stolen Identity,"This deeply colored, full-bodied wine adds chocolaty richness to ripe plum and blackberry flavors, backed with light tannins that counter a bit of sweetness."
US,88.0,12.0,Washington,Charles Smith,"This wine opens with just a touch of reduction followed by quite pure aromas of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet and fresh, with the tannins bringing a light grip."
Italy,85.0,11.0,Prosecco Treviso,La Gioiosa,"This offers fresh, soothing sensations of citrus, dried grass and white flower. The style is Brut, which means this expression is slightly drier than the majority of Proseccos found on the market today."
US,90.0,39.0,Sonoma Coast,MacPhail,"The winery has held back release on this Pinot considerably longer than their vineyard--designated wines. It's softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with concentrated raspberry and cherry jam, brown sugar, vanilla bean and spice flavors. Lovely to drink now and over the next few years."
US,94.0,150.0,Napa Valley,Spring Mountain Vineyard,"Beginning with a velvety texture and inviting bouquet of strawberry and rose, this classic blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 8% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is grown on the winery's 845-acre estate atop Spring Mountain. Kirsch, black pepper and chocolate combine atop a smooth, integrated palate that's elegant from start to finish, the oak tempered to good effect. Drink now through 2027."
US,89.0,25.0,Paso Robles,Volatus,"Made to pair with halibut on the winemaker's annual trip to Alaska, this blend of 68% Viognier, 16% Marsanne and 16% Grenache Blanc shows beeswax, seared pears, caramel corn, apple syrup and peach crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e on the nose. It's light and playful on the palate, with ripe lemons, rounded stone fruit, honeysuckle and citrus zest."
US,83.0,25.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Cave B,"This wine seems barely ripe, with thin, herbal, almost vegetal flavors and a sour streak. The barrel aging may have contributed some suggestions of vanilla and licorice."
US,86.0,12.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Skyfall,Light aromas of freshly shucked corn and spice lead to a medium-bodied straightforward palate. It's straight down the fairway.
US,91.0,36.0,Wahluke Slope,Fielding Hills,"Vanilla, baking spice, coconut and dark fruit aromas lead to plush, plentiful purple-fruit flavors. It provides a lot of enjoyment and appeal, showing equal parts fruit and barrel."
Argentina,84.0,30.0,Mendoza,Trapiche,"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more."
US,86.0,13.0,Mendocino County,Bonterra,"Bonterra's first rosÃ©, showing the clean purity and balance that nearly always characterize its wines. Bone dry and vibrant in acidity, this Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Grenache blend has tart cherry, raspberry, tea and vanilla flavors. You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off."
US,90.0,50.0,Carneros,Bouchaine,"Rich, thick and swimming in youthful tannin, this is a powerful statement from the producer's estate, a broad-shouldered explosion of fruity and savory flavors. Spicy tea, pomegranate and black cherry mingle around a tartness of grapefruit and blood orange, coalescing into a balanced whole."
Italy,86.0,60.0,Barbaresco,La Spinetta,"This wine's oak, weedy underbrush, celery and vegetable broth aromas carry over to the lean palate, along with a roasted coffee bean note. Raspy tannins clench the finish."
Spain,88.0,16.0,Cava,El XamfrÃ ,"Dusty aromas of yellow apple and cream soda are creamier than the palate, which is tangy, lemony and green. This tastes of briny citrus and green apple, while tangerine, lime and green-herb flavors define the finish."
US,90.0,40.0,Ballard Canyon,Site,"This wine is made by Paso Robles-based Jeremy Weintraub, who also works at Adelaida Winery. Aromas recall beeswax, light banana, ripe nectarine, lemon curd and white flowers. Soft once sipped, it proves easy to drink, with flavors of chamomile tea, yellow pear, yellow apples and roasted nuts."
France,91.0,24.0,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss,"A pure rendition of honeysuckle blossom rises from this wine along with notes of ripe pear. The palate has something both crystalline and stony, pure and distinct. Beyond its central seam of freshness the wine shimmers with rich, earthy nuance of ripe pear on one side, of brisk zestiness on the other. Drink now and until 2020."
US,95.0,44.0,Santa Maria Valley,Piro,"Though still exploring the zesty acid-driven side of Pinot Noir, Marc Piro adds depth and richness to this bottling. Red cherry compote and cordial meet fennel, dill, tarragon and tapenade on the nose. The extremely lively and fresh palate unleashes an array of flower petals, just-pressed tart berries and Kalamata olives. A deep structure and thorough acidity complete the picture."
France,88.0,53.0,Haut-MÃ©doc,ChÃ¢teau Bellegrave du Poujeau,"Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink."
Italy,87.0,28.0,Umbria,Decugnano dei Barbi,"This blend of Montepulciano, Syrah and Sangiovese offers aromas of wet earth, black fruit and oak. The palate is a bit closed but reveals blackberry and cherry flavors, with a hint of licorice. This already drinking well so enjoy soon."
Italy,87.0,18.0,Gavi,Principessa Gavia,"This 100% Cortese wine has a slight fizz and an almost imperceptibly faint touch of sweetness. Hay and herb aromas open to grapy flavors accented by smoky notes. A crisp mouthfeel and classic Gavi almond, lime and smoke notes close this pleaser."
US,87.0,42.0,Wahluke Slope,Milbrandt,"Generous barrel aromas of vanilla and wood spice are followed full-bodied, no-holds-barred fruit and vanilla flavors. There are good things going on but the wood steals the show."
US,84.0,23.0,Central Coast,Ternion,"The wine has lingering leather touches on the tongue and quite a lot of bitter tension throughout. Like many 2011s, it shows a tartness and grip that some may find pleasant, and others just challenging. Food seems a must for this wine, which comes out of Terravant Wine Company in Buellton; try fondue, salted meats, or aged cheese."
US,89.0,35.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tertulia,"A blend of the winery's Whistling Hills and Riviere Galets vineyards, this wine brings aromas of funk, coffee, tire rubber, blue fruit and smoke. The cranberry and cherry notes are sweet and full flavored, hanging on the finish."
France,90.0,30.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau le Roudier,"There is plenty of ripe fruit here. With soft tannins and a generous structure, the wine is rich, full of berry and red-plum flavors and with just enough tannins. Give this fruity wine until 2018."
US,91.0,65.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Tantara,Fruity aromas of fresh strawberry mash mix with touches of slate and a twist of dried mint on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Rick Hill. The palate relies on light black-raspberry flavors that are lifted by black-tea leaves and a touch of orange-rind tang.
France,89.0,16.0,Alsace,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim,"Fresh red apple and tangy mandarin flavors unite in a fruity and fun combo. The palate is equally fruit-driven and refreshing, with bright but ripe acidity. This is a light-footed summer apÃ©ritif and very moreish."
US,89.0,28.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Tamarack Cellars,"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat."
Italy,86.0,19.0,Prosecco di Conegliano,Sommariva,"This Prosecco Brut from the slightly warmer Conegliano subzone is a perfect example of its kind. The luminous sparkler offers drying mineral tones that are embellished by pretty notes of white rose, honey, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is lean, smooth and fresh."
US,93.0,35.0,Horse Heaven Hills,Reasons,"A mix of small lot-fermented, Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon, some from Champoux, it's fine-tuned, varietal, loaded with cassis and plum, light toast, and ground coffee. Elegant, proportionate, and a fine expression of a great vintage."
US,85.0,38.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Zerba Cellars,"This opens green and herbal, with a disconnected mix of unripe and grapy fruit flavors. The new barrel aging brings toast and butter, but behind that the wine is still disjointed and the fruit flavors all up front."
US,91.0,50.0,North Coast,Langtry,"The bouquet is pretty big and dense, with some high-tone raspberry peeking through the surface. Black plum and cherry get help from licorice and vanilla on the palate. Zippy fruit is the signature, even as it does a nice, long fade."
Canada,85.0,50.0,Niagara Peninsula,Pillitteri,"This is an intriguing red, with its nose of dried fennel, eucalyptus, and rosemary, and on the palate, pretty flavors of cassis and anise. Though gentle, the wine has balance and character. Imported by Wine Emporium."
US,93.0,85.0,Chehalem Mountains,Alloro,"This demonstrates, as well as any other example, that exceptional wines were made in the often-maligned 2011 vintage. Cranberry, raspberry, cola and allspice elements are woven gracefully in a lovely wine that closes with just a faint, beguiling whiff of smoke."
US,87.0,20.0,Alexander Valley,Field Stone,"Dark in color, the wine is meaty, dry and brambly in wild strawberry. It's easy to drink and like, with a smooth, hearty finish."
Argentina,84.0,15.0,Mendoza,Cruz Alta,"Orange blossom and other common white fruit aromas make for a standard, generic type of bouquet. The palate is regular in feel and weight, with shy flavors of melon and apple. Entirely middle of the road in aromas, body, feel and flavors."
France,86.0,17.0,CÃ´tes de Provence,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,"Burgundy producer Aegerter has come up with a bright and breezy Provence rosÃ© whose style sums up the lighter side of these wines. It is fruity, fresh, very clean and crisp."
France,88.0,50.0,Champagne,Waris Hubert,"Chardonnay from three grand cru villages in the CÃ´te des Blancs, this tense mineral wine is bone dry with citrus and apple crispness. It is tight and nervy, still young and needing to age further. This will be ready to drink from late 2018."
Italy,84.0,9.0,Salento,Conti Zecca,"Here's a Malvasia that delivers aromas of almond skin and stone fruit backed by good dimension and density. Pair this easy white wine with sandwiches, salads and grilled vegetables."
US,86.0,15.0,Cayuga Lake,Knapp,"Refreshing on the palate with a fresh apple aroma and juicy pink grapefruits on the palate, this medium-bodied GewÃ¼rztraminer is an easy-drinking, eminently quaffable wine. Off-dry like a brisk, honey-sweetened iced tea, it finishes with a pleasant kick of spice and potpourri."
Italy,80.0,12.0,Colli Aprutini,Fattoria Giuseppe Savini,"There's a thorny, almost raw quality of fruit here that is backed by a touch of dill weed and black tar. It feels tart and slightly bitter on the close."
US,91.0,48.0,Paso Robles,Lone Madrone,"Grapes come from heritage selection off the Osgood farm, and the wine shows licorice-berry-chocolate syrup aromas, as well as espresso with condensed milk and pipe smoke. The tannins coat the mouth and tickle the tongue in a pleasant way, offering rich plum fruit, graphite minerality and lifting mint, all balanced with strong acidity."
US,84.0,12.0,California,Trim,This offers lots of oak-infused blackberry jam and chocolate flavors. It's a little bit too soft and sweet.
US,85.0,15.0,Yakima Valley,Mercer,"Off-dry and minty, with a strong streak of wintergreen, this simple, fruity Riesling offers fruit flavors of green apple and a bit of waxy lemon."
US,84.0,39.0,Umpqua Valley,Reustle,"An intriguing wine, with aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, herbs and red fruit. The palate can't deliver all that these aromas have to offer though, seeming underripe and without the structure to hold them together. Interestingly, it's aged in 100% new oak?half French and half American?but the wood doesn't show."
France,84.0,14.0,Saint-Chinian,Terre de Loups,"A coppery orange color, this opens with aromas of mealy melon, peach and strawberry. The palate is a departure from the nose?surprisingly astringent in tart currant and red-plum skin flavors that finish sharp and fast."
US,87.0,25.0,Yakima Valley,McCrea Cellars,"This is just the second varietal bottling of Marsanne?single vineyard at that?from McCrea. Firm and fleshy, with clear melon flavors, it shows a dash of cinnamon along the way. The finish brings on graham cracker accents, though only neutral oak was used."
US,84.0,23.0,Paso Robles,Minassian-Young,"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, a wine with tastes of chocolate-covered cherries, raspberries and smoky sandalwood. Drink now."
Spain,81.0,14.0,Navarra,Ochoa,"Air freshner and lychee are the most identifiable aromas. The palate feels fresh and light, which, given the wine's fleshy, tropical flavors, is a compliment. An oily, bitter finish is similar to marginal TorrontÃ©s from Argentina."
US,93.0,29.0,Seneca Lake,Hermann J. Wiemer,"Orange blossom and lemon zest perfume this intensely aromatic dry Riesling. Plump yellow cherry and tangerine flavors build on the palate, invigorated by racy zips of acidity and crushed-stone minerality. Buoyantly pretty yet firmly structured to improve at least another decade."
US,90.0,30.0,Mount Veeder,Evolve,"Shows the firm tannins of this mountain appellation, and also ripe, concentrated blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate fruit. Easy to drink now for its rich appeal, but should age well for six years or so."
US,86.0,40.0,Napa Valley,O'Brien,"Firm in tannins, this Bordeaux blend was grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District of the valley. Along with the astringency, it shows very ripe, sweetly jammy flavors of black cherries, currants and licorice. Could improve with cellaring."
France,88.0,25.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau de Gaudou,"Heavily wooded, the wine is essentially toast with a touch of fruit. Of course, it is young, and the rich black fruits behind all this smokiness will come through. Drink after 2019."
US,90.0,23.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Novelty Hill,"Milk chocolate, cherry and raspberry aromas lead to sweet, supple luscious fruit flavors. It keeps you coming back for more."
US,85.0,18.0,Willamette Valley,Capitello,"This Pinot Gris offers a distinctive mix of flavors, with apple, pear, pink grapefruit and sweet Meyer lemon all in the tangle of fruit. It's sappy and soft, but runs afoul of some mousy, bacterial flavors in the finish. Except for that, it would score much better."
US,91.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Broadley,"The Shea cuvÃ©e has more stuffing than the other Broadley Pinots, with clean strawberry-cherry flavors. There's a streak of caramel running through the middle, and overall it's a well-balanced, forward and flavorful wine that will drink nicely now through the early 2020s."
US,85.0,26.0,Carneros,Saintsbury,"Fruity and simple, a mÃ©lange of thorn bush berry and tree fruit flavors encased in silky tannins and adequate acids. A good candidate for a tutorial on Pinot Noir."
US,85.0,18.0,Central Coast,Claiborne & Churchill,"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apÃ©ritif sipper."
US,89.0,35.0,Russian River Valley,Windsor Oaks,"This Pinot could certainly withstand a few years of aging, but there's really no reason to cellar it. It's all about rich, ripe, flamboyant fruit in the way of cherries, persimmons and raspberries. For all the forward fruitiness, the wine finishes dry and firm in acids and tannins."
US,91.0,44.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Dierberg,"Give this Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter before drinking it. Right out of the bottle, it's tight and brittle, but air brings out the core notes of cherry, vanilla, red currant and cedar, and makes it develop a drink-me-now appeal."
US,91.0,30.0,Amador County,Morse,"This rich and full-bodied wine is a great candidate for aging. Stash it away in a cool place until at least 2018 when its slightly rough and drying tannins should begin to mellow and let all the ripe fruit and complex spice flavors come out. It's blended with a touch of MourvÃ¨dre for a spicy, earthy accent."
US,84.0,22.0,Russian River Valley,Hauck,"A bit on the sugary side, making it not truly dry, but adequate acidity provides balance to the very rich pineapple, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. Great with Vietnamese or Chinese fare."
US,88.0,22.0,Willamette Valley,Silvan Ridge,"Forward and fruity, this has California-style fruit and sweet, strawberry candy. The difference is that it fills out the middle with some leafy, herbal flavors, nothing too rough, but enough to add some flavor interest. The finish is fat and buttery, showing the influence of oak aging."
US,91.0,52.0,Columbia Gorge (OR),Wy'East Vineyards,"This is crafted from the oldest vines, planted a quarter-century ago. Toast and caramel flavors wrap around lightly roasted raspberry/strawberry fruit. Highlights of rose petals and cola come into play, as this reserve-level effort shows both grip and persistence."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Morellino di Scansano,Vignaioli del Morellino di Scansano,"Aromas of dried black fruit, violet and a whiff of grilled herb lead the nose. The palate offers crushed black cherry, vanilla, mocha and baking spice alongside firm but rather astringent tannins."
Italy,90.0,70.0,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Carpineto,"Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins."
US,88.0,10.0,California,Dark Horse,"A good sense of concentration and depth make this medium-bodied wine taste big and satisfying without overdoing it. It has a very dark color, fruity and lightly spicy aromas, rich plum and black cherry flavors and rather mild tannins."
US,94.0,80.0,Napa Valley,Purlieu,"This rich, complex Cabernet feels dramatic in the mouth. It impacts immediately with black currant, cassis and oak flavors, yet is thoroughly dry, with firm, smooth tannins and an oily umami chewiness, like charred steak fat off the grill. The winemaker, Julien Fayard, previously was at Lafite Rothschild. He brings a Bordeaux-esque sensitivity to Napa's rich, ripe fruit. Hold until 2018."
US,96.0,95.0,Napa Valley,Darioush,"Sanguine and brooding in dense layers of juicy black fruit, leather and tobacco, this is classic Napa Valley Cabernet with an elegance at its core, that's also seamless, complex and age-worthy. From relatively cooler sites in Oak Knoll and Mount Veeder, and a cooler year too, this vintage sings for this producer, showing balance and power in equal measure."
France,85.0,8.0,Vin de France,CuvÃ©e Lion d'Or,"A blend of Grenache Blanc and Viognier, this is attractive, fruity and perfumed. Touches of apricot balance with the green fruits and herbal edge. It's an easy wine to drink, best as an apÃ©ritif."
Italy,94.0,50.0,Morellino di Scansano,Castello di MontepÃ²,"This structured, elegant wine opens with aromas of violet, berry, tilled soil and a whiff of leather. The palate has nice depth, offering layers of black cherry, cinnamon, savory herb and tobacco. It's impeccably balanced with firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. Already delicious, it will develop more complexity. Drink 2015??025."
France,94.0,150.0,Corton,Albert Bichot,"One-quarter of the Clos des MarÃ©chaudes is classified Grand Cru, as the soil and the slope change. This shows in the power of the wine with its smoky tannins and dark character. Black fruits and a dense texture signify a wine with power and longevity. Drink from 2022."
US,85.0,22.0,Virginia,Barboursville Vineyards,"Medium bodied, this wine has a loose-feeling entrance, but zesty acids quickly surface and invigorate the palate. The flavors of tropical fruit, nectarine and white strawberry are appealing, but they would benefit from increased concentration and focus. Try pairing this easy quaffer with light poultry-based dishes and simple preparations of white fish."
Italy,90.0,20.0,Sicilia,Feudo Arancio,"Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this round, chewy red offers ripe wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. Smooth, velvety tannins support the juicy flavors and give it a polished texture. It's savory and accessible and will offer pure drinking enjoyment over the next few years."
US,89.0,52.0,Willamette Valley,Rex Hill,"Organically grown, this fruit is from the estate vineyard in the Chehalem Mountains. Old vine elegance and subtlety are much in evidence, even in this bottling from a difficult, rain-soaked vintage. It's a delicate wine that nonetheless offers persistent, complex flavors: strawberry and sour cherry, dried Italian herbs and a finishing lick of chocolate."
US,86.0,22.0,Napa Valley,V. Sattui,"Simple in buttered popcorn and toast flavors, this Chard has underlying flavors of pineapples. It's a dry wine, crisp in acidity. Made in the popular style for drinking now."
Italy,89.0,24.0,Sicilia,Terrazze dell'Etna,"A blend of 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of toast, mature black-skinned berry, scorched earth, espresso and clove. The evolved palate delivers dried black currant, licorice, roasted coffee bean and tobacco alongside close grained tannins."
Spain,85.0,10.0,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Volteo,"Perfumed, chunky and almondy on the nose. Feels full and oily but also a bit juicy, with driving, penetrating orange and grapefruit flavors. Offers proper weight and spicy citrus flavors on the finish. Drink immediately as it's losing freshness and turning yellow."
France,93.0,120.0,ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape,ChÃ¢teau de Beaucastel,"At first glance, this is not particularly impressive; it's slightly herbal and rustic, with a raisiny edge to the fruit. But this really improves with air, fleshing out on the midpalate and losing the raisiny notes in favor of plum and savory notes. Give it four or five years in the cellar and drink it over the next 15 or so."
Italy,87.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Piccini,"Stewed plum, savory herb and tobacco aromas carry through to the full-bodied palate along with dried red cherry, coffee, anisette and a confectionary note. It's big and brawny, with bracing tannins."
Italy,85.0,13.0,Asti,Martini & Rossi,"Here's a luminous Asti (a sweet fizzy Italian wine) with fragrant aromas of bee's wax, lavender honey and white rose. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with lingering sweetness and peach-like flavors on the close."
US,84.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Ca' Momi,"This Chardonnay has flavors of jammy tangerine, peach, tropical fruit and white sugar."
Argentina,83.0,13.0,Mendoza,Amadores,"Stalky aromas of burnt hay blend with white fruit scents. Bland apple and stalky flavors are balanced by decent acidity, then finishes with burnt, oily accents."
US,87.0,30.0,Applegate Valley,Cowhorn,"This is a pure Grenache, tart and spicy, with powerful herb components. It is not fruity or sappy-sweet by any measure, but it delivers moderately concentrated flavors highlighted by herb and earth notes, with good length and balance."
US,94.0,48.0,Adelaida District,Alta Colina,"Enhanced by 3% Viognier, this wine from Bob Tillman offers smoked meat on the nose, showing why Syrah pairs perfectly with the grill. Aromas of charred beef, charcoal and fresh-cracked black pepper lead into a palate dense with blueberry and blackberry, spiced with more pepper, soy and roasted coffee bean, and redolent with roasted-lamb flavors."
US,91.0,69.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"Tight-grained tannin plays a supporting role to this wine's undeniable earthiness, a mix of compost and wild mushroom. Subtle on the nose, the savory character gives way eventually to a density and concentration of brighter flavors, from cherry and citrus to spiky pine."
France,87.0,14.0,Bordeaux SupÃ©rieur,ChÃ¢teau de Cornemps,"This is rounded, with its ripe fruit dominating the new wood influence. It is dense and smoothly rich, with blackberry and bitter coffee flavors. Age for three to four years."
US,89.0,29.0,Paso Robles,Vina Robles,"Waiting to release this wine greatly benefits the experience, with inviting aromas of blueberry pie and perfectly roasted meat emerging. There still are strong tannins, but they're more digestible, with flavors of red and light purple fruits, violet, mocha, and plum skin."
US,87.0,48.0,Russian River Valley,J Vineyards & Winery,"You can taste the dosage on this Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier brut in the overt sweetness that accompanies the pear, citrus and raspberry fruit flavors. With noticeable residual sugar, it's not really a dry sparkling wine, but it is delicious."
Italy,88.0,38.0,Sicilia,Tenuta di Serramarrocco,"Nero di Serramarrocco is a thick, meaty Sicilian red with aromas of bacon fat, spice and mature blackberry. The mouthfeel is compact and clean and not too thick or syrupy."
US,91.0,38.0,Paso Robles,Ms. Behave,"Densely packed rose, black cherries, sandalwood and a flash of pepper show in this bottling?a new project featuring a risquÃ© label by Peachy Canyon. Pepper, smoke and roasted pork are evident on the dry palate, alongside a hint of lilac."
US,91.0,50.0,Willamette Valley,Carden,"Firm and flavorful, this brings well-ripened raspberry and black cherry fruit into focus. The wine spent 17 months in 60% new French oak, wrapping the fruit in layers of coffee, maple syrup and brown sugar. It's tasty and substantial, best now through 2020."
US,83.0,22.0,Monterey,Carmel Road,"This sustainably grown Arroyo Seco wine has a very reluctant nose that eventually gives off some red-purple fruits. The palate offers a bit more, with cranberry and some slate."
Spain,84.0,9.0,Spain,Vicente Gandia,"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out."
Argentina,91.0,23.0,LujÃ¡n de Cuyo,ViÃ±a Las Perdices,"Leather and earth aromas are just part of the meaty, roasted, lightly charred bouquet. The palate is thick and jammy, with savory, roasted flavors of berry fruit, pepper and leather. Finishes with chocolate and a fine texture. Impressive despite having a light herbal streak. 500 cases made."
Spain,87.0,9.0,Rioja,MarquÃ©s de CÃ¡ceres,"Pink in color, this has fresh, clean aromas of stone fruits. Feels medium to full, with red licorice, sweet baking-spice and raspberry flavors. Quick, round and solid on the finish, which lingers for quite some time. A fine summer sipper."
US,91.0,28.0,Central Coast,1850,"This Sierra Foothills-based winery makes a compelling if atypical Sangiovese that offers black cherry, soy, crushed rock and rose petal scents. Upright tannins present strawberry, black plum and loamy soil flavors, finishing on a sweet-savory hoisin sauce note."
US,82.0,14.0,California,Red Rock,"Sweet-sour and soft, like a cough medicine, this Malbec has nothing to do with the real Argentinian stuff."
France,89.0,25.0,Chablis,Domaine CheneviÃ¨res,"This domaine is now sold through the Jean-Marc Brocard family. This is a rich wine with yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus. There is a touch of pepper that lifts the fine acidity and the ripe apple and peach. At the end, the wine is crisp and clean."
Italy,89.0,35.0,Collio,Collavini,"Made with Friulano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon, this offers aromas of white flower, tropical fruit, tomato leaf and citrus. The bright linear palate offers yellow peach, candied lemon zest and dried herb alongside tangy acidity."
Spain,92.0,35.0,Ribera del Duero,12 Linajes,"Opening plum and raspberry aromas are complete and elegant, with dry earthy notes. This feels lush and layered with deep plum, raspberry and creamy oak flavors. Through to the finish, this is long, nicely oaked and complex in flavors and strong in structure and balance. Drink through 2021."
France,87.0,11.0,Vin de France,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"An off-dry blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng, this comes from the French southwest. Named after a sandy beach in the Basque Country, the wine has that cool feel of ocean breezes. Honey and lemon flavors are right up front to give a wine that is both fresh and beautifully fragrant."
US,86.0,40.0,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Deuce,"The oak is far out in front, with the aromas of vanilla, dill and freshly hewn wood making it difficult to find the fruit. Cranberry flavors struggle to get to the surface. It's technically well made but the barrel treatment completely overrides any sense of the variety."
Italy,91.0,70.0,Barolo,Sordo,"Leather, mature dark-skinned berry, clove and star anise aromas lead into the velvety, surprisingly approachable palate. Solid but rounded tannins uphold the juicy flavors. Drink through 2022."
France,92.0,24.0,Alsace,Joseph Fritsch,"Unusual rose petal perfume hovers above the apple-scented nose. The palate is dry but textured and open, broad but fluid and poised. There is a seam of taut, bright and pure lemon acidity that frames everything neatly and which makes this totally appetizing and moreish in all its fruitfulness."
US,93.0,42.0,Santa Barbara County,Tensley,"There are expected aromas of ripe blueberry, purple flowers, peppercorns and burnt bacon on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills, but Joey Tensley also packs in quite a bit of herbs, with bay leaf and dried chaparral. Tightly wound flavors of dark purple fruit, beef char and coarsely ground black pepper show on the tarry sip."
Italy,89.0,21.0,Vernaccia di San Gimignano,Falchini,"Aromas of yellow pear, Spanish broom and a whiff of honeyed nut float from the glass. The medium-bodied palate shows good weight and depth for the cool wet vintage, offering golden apple, nectarine zest and bitter almond framed in vibrant acidity. It finishes crisp and clean, with an underlying pinning of flint on the close."
France,88.0,25.0,CrÃ©mant de Bourgogne,Bailly-Lapierre,"Mainly Pinot Noir with a touch of Gamay, this is a crisp red-currant flavored wine. It comes from northern Burgundy giving a cool character to this fruity wine. The acidity and the orange zest at the end are really refreshing."
France,85.0,33.0,CrÃ©mant de Jura,Domaine de Savagny,"Packed with acidity as much as fruit, this is a tight, intensely fresh wine. There are some hints of tannins from the Pinot Noir as well as raspberry fruits, although the crisp acidity shows most strongly."
US,87.0,35.0,Willamette Valley,Left Coast Cellars,"This low alcohol wine offers tart, young, raspberry fruit, without much concentration. It was aged in 70% new French oak, which imparts a toasty, chocolatey edge to the finish."
US,90.0,48.0,Dundee Hills,Native Flora,"Light pretty red fruits mingle here, supported with tart citrus. It's an elegant, rather steely style, and one that needs aeration and a bit of patience. The best drinking window should be 2020 through 2025."
France,94.0,55.0,Cahors,ChÃ¢teau du CÃ¨dre,"Pure Malbec, this wine from organic grapes is black, dark and powerful. It's driven by its tannins and dry wood and fruit flavors. For the moment, this serious, structured wine is waiting on the fruit to develop. It's a complex, spicy, dense wine that shouldn't be drunk before 2020."
Italy,89.0,19.0,Primitivo di Manduria,Ognissole,"An elegant expression of this grape, this smooth, full-bodied wine delivers layers of spicy plum, juicy blackberry, graphite, clove and licorice. Firm but velvety tannins provide ample texture and support."
Italy,93.0,45.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Castello Romitorio,"Sandro Chia and his family at Castello Romitorio offer a rich, plush and velvety expression of Brunello with excellent dimension and staying power. Plump fruit flavors and black cherry color the long, soft fade."
US,94.0,140.0,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,CaptÃ»re,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10??0 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young."
France,89.0,50.0,Saint-Romain,Domaine de Bellene,"Recognized for its good value, Saint-Romain is particularly strong on white wines. This wine, from old vines, shows some concentration and rich fruits that are balanced by toast flavors. It is a ripe wine with a strongly refreshing feel at the end."
France,94.0,280.0,Chambolle-Musigny,Joseph Drouhin,"With its fine tannic structure, plum juice sweetness and beautifully ripe fruits, this is a wine that combines structure with a rich velvet coat. The acidity gives a fine lift, bringing out strawberries and a final piercing freshness."
Italy,83.0,11.0,Chianti,Badia di Morrona,"There's some interesting game and slate accents on the nose here, but also a candied quality to the cherry fruit. The acidity is fairly high and the tannins tense and somewhat drying on the finish."
US,93.0,20.0,Napa Valley,Jax,"This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish."
Argentina,85.0,10.0,Valle de Uco,Salentein,"A hard coating of woodspice sits atop herbal plum and berry aromas. This feels tough and nearly impermeable. Spicy, briary plum flavors are lean and taste woody on a dry, tannic finish."
Italy,91.0,46.0,Franciacorta,Barone Pizzini,"Expressive aromas of white flower, acacia, citrus and pear float from the glass of this elegant and organic sparkling wine. The lively palate delivers mature yellow apple, lemon zest, bread crust and toasted almond alongside a silky mousse and vibrant acidity."
US,90.0,40.0,Russian River Valley,Peter Paul Wines,"From Old Wente clones grown on the famous vineyard, this full-bodied, textured wine shows ripe elements of golden honey, Gravenstein apple and toasted vanilla oak. Along the way, it flirts nicely with pear and marzipan, finishing in balanced minerality."
Italy,88.0,32.0,Chianti Superiore,Castel di Pugna,"Aromas of underbrush, wild berry, dried herb and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. The round palate doles out crushed black cherry, ripe plum, sage and clove alongside soft acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2016."
France,85.0,12.0,Vin de Pays d'Oc,Kedar's K'orus,"Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste."
France,88.0,63.0,Meursault,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils,"A heavily wood-aged wine, this wine has smoky, burnt-toast aromas. At the moment, ripe yellow-fruit flavors are submerged beneath this onslaught of wood, but it should integrate better, so give it until 2016."
US,93.0,35.0,Santa Cruz Mountains,Beauregard,"Concentrate rose petals, crisp raspberries, and a rocky, black gravel?not quite as pungent as asphalt?pervades the nose on this wine from an extremely coastal, 13-acre vineyard planted in 1988. Flavors of freshly picked blackberry mesh with lots of fennel, licorice and anise-seed spice."
France,84.0,13.0,Beaujolais-Villages,Georges Duboeuf,Banana flavors spoil this otherwise attractive and fruity wine. A dry core of tannins is surrounded by creamed banana and red fruits. Drink now.
Italy,86.0,75.0,Barolo,Virna Borgogno,"Toast, oak, menthol and coconut aromas carry over to the bracing palate along with mocha and mint. It lacks fruit richness while raspy tannins generate an astringent close."
US,81.0,12.0,Paso Robles,Purple Cowboy,"Sweet and thin, showing sour cherry flavors and a prickly mouthfeel. Cabernet and Syrah."
US,83.0,9.0,California,Woodbridge,"There are some Chard elements in this rustic, countrified wine. The apple and peach flavors, with oaky vanilla overtones, are familiar. But itÃs a rough wine, with some odd, vegetal qualities. Satisfactory, if youÃre not very fussy."
US,89.0,42.0,Santa Maria Valley,Stephen Ross,"Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling."
US,85.0,33.0,Virginia,Barrel Oak,"A blend of 60% Touriga Nacional and 40% Cabernet Franc, this smells of peppered blackberries, compost, smoke and char. The palate is structured with sustaining acids and a medium load of chunky tannins. A dark berry flavor and a hint of dried flower add interest."
US,91.0,32.0,Sta. Rita Hills,Melville,"There's intriguing precision to the nose of this bottling from Chad Melville and family. A laser-sharp line of tart elderberry, black-plum skins and black-cherry skins cut through the dark earth, tar and purple-flower elements. The palate blends approachable black raspberry, dark strawberry and muddled mulberry fruit with touches of coffee and dark cocoa."
Italy,86.0,15.0,Moscato d'Asti,Cupcake,"Fun and refreshing, this bright dessert wine has aromas of white spring flower and tropical fruit. The lightly foaming palate presents ripe apricot, peach and a hint of aromatic herb while a note of candied lemon drop closes the soft finish."
Italy,91.0,90.0,Barolo,Marchesi di Barolo,"Pretty aromas of blue flower, rose, wild berry and graphite lead the way. The firm palate delivers mature black cherry, raspberry, star anise, black pepper and chopped sage alongside bright acidity and tightly knit tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018??026."
US,84.0,17.0,Madera,Westbrook Wine Farm,"Fruity and easy, this soft wine has sweet flavors of apricots and caramel. ValdiguiÃ©, formerly known as Napa Gamay, is a red grape, and that accounts for the note of crushed raspberries."
US,88.0,32.0,Carneros,Peter Cellars,"Inviting in succulent, brambly berry, this is a balanced wine that takes a light approach to ripeness. Clove and vanilla add to its admirable length and breadth."
US,91.0,36.0,Columbia Valley (WA),Elsom Cellars,"Interesting highlights of English Breakfast tea and toasted grains complement the strawberry fruit in this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 46% Malbec and 8% Syrah. Layered and complex, it shows pleasing hints of lightly composted earth."
Spain,86.0,32.0,Vino de Calidad de Tierras de LeÃ³n,Pardevalles,"Prieto Picudo is the grape here, and it's not your run-of-the-mill red variety. The nose is minty green and rustic, and you can tell it's not cut from a common cloth. In the mouth, Carroleon shows cassis and carob, while the finish has chocolate and a medicinal essence. Top-heavy in terms of concentration, with a thin middle tier."
France,89.0,17.0,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas,"Ripe yellow apple and yellow plum notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate is equally fresh and full fruited, sporting sassy, defining freshness that makes it mouthwatering and appetizing."
US,93.0,54.0,Dundee Hills,Archery Summit,"Unique and exotic, this Pinot Gris is crisp and textural, with the edges rounded out as if gently sanded by the contours of the concrete egg fermenter. A complex mix of cucumber, citrus, green herb, apple, pear and lemon verbena flavors, it's got tremendous grip, depth, balance and weight. Drink now through 2020."
US,94.0,69.0,Napa Valley,Dominus,"From the producer's Yountville estate, this blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc offers thyme, stone and black pepper flavors within a leathery texture. Concentrated and structured, it further shines with black currant and tobacco notes that give it a distinct herbal edge."
France,90.0,38.0,Vouvray,Domaine Vincent CarÃªme,"Fermented only once in bottle, this wine is made in a traditional way used before Champagne was created. It's full in the mouth, nutty and rounded. It has ripe white fruits, greengages and a mineral texture. Ready to drink, it is rich and full-bodied."
US,93.0,75.0,Napa Valley,Merryvale,"A beautiful, elegant and dramatic blend for drinking now and over the next 6??0 years. Based on Cabernet, and sourced from vineyards including Beckstoffer ToKalon and Showket, it's flashy in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with gorgeous, refined tannins. It's throwing some tannins, so you might want to give it a proper decant."
France,94.0,86.0,Chablis,Domaine Laroche,"Structured and minerally, this has citrus fruits that sit prominently over the tight acidity. A vanilla note is there to round the wine out. The crisp fruits and steely acids are intense and impressively balanced. Age for at least 5 years. Screwcap."
US,89.0,16.0,Santa Ynez Valley,Buttonwood Farm,"Heavier and denser in every respect than the regular Sauvignon Blanc, this wine, a 60-40 blend with SÃ©millon, is also strongly leesy. The citrus flavors hit the palate with a strong dose of rich sour cream notes. The wine is dry and practically cries out for garlicky dishes."
US,87.0,14.0,Umpqua Valley,Girardet,"A mash-up of eight grapes, including such obscure varieties as Landot Noir, MarÃ©chal Foch and Chancellor, this is the sort of wine you might happily enjoy while driving the back roads of rural Europe. Light, tart flavors of pie cherries are touched with leathery earth. Hints of plum and tobacco add further interest."
US,91.0,45.0,Arroyo Seco,Blair,"Peppery herbs lead the nose on this bottling, with sagebrush, bay leaf and rust giving depth to the light cranberry and raspberry fruit. The palate is earthy with juniper and turned-loam flavors, plus more bay leaf, iron cranberry and some rhubarb."
Australia,86.0,10.0,South Eastern Australia,Jindalee,"A good value, this Chardonnay delivers plenty of mouthfilling flavor for the price. Pineapple and melon fruit is tinged with a touch of mint, and while the flavors may be somewhat simple, at least they're assertive."
US,92.0,22.0,Oregon,Iris Vineyards,"This limited production wine advances the proposition that Pinot Gris can be substantial, complex and at least as ageworthy as the better Oregon Chardonnays. The mix of melon, white peach and lemon zest flavors, with compelling minerality, may inspire some additional cellar time. Drink now through 2024."
US,95.0,75.0,Russian River Valley,Gary Farrell,"This is a stellar wine. Dusty citrus spiked with clove comes to mind first aromatically and continues through to the palate. Tart acidity supports sublime texture and a lightness that never means lean. Red currant, grapefruit and orange provide additional lift and focus."
US,90.0,48.0,Sonoma Coast,Sojourn,"Light and clear in color, this impish wine needs time to grow up in the bottle, its profile momentarily giving way almost entirely to savory Asian five-spice and a sharp acidity that should interweave together expertly over the years. Vibrant and complex, the fruit is sultry and dusted in earth. Set this one down through 2017."
France,87.0,15.0,Bordeaux,Les Vignerons RÃ©unis de MonsÃ©gur,"Young and fruity, this is an attractive red- and black-currant-flavored wine. Its youthful stalky character will soften quickly to highlight the fruit. Drink from late 2016."
France,91.0,20.0,Muscadet SÃ¨vre et Maine,Domaine de la PepiÃ¨re,"The light-gold color of this wine shows its maturity. It's a rich wine that is rounded, full and with a touch of honey. With its toasty character and full-bodied character, this is an impressive wine for drinking now."
US,84.0,10.0,California,Big House,"A simple, easy wine to drink, crisp and slightly sweet in orange, lime, peach and pear flavors."
Italy,87.0,50.0,Barbaresco,Moccagatta,"This forward wine opens with aromas that recall nail polish remover, varnish, overripe black-skinned fruit and a confectionary note. On the palate, notes of coconut, espresso and sage backup raw red cherry. It's aggressively tannic but is already losing fruit richness so hold for just a few years to let tannins unwind and then drink."
US,88.0,24.0,Dry Creek Valley,David Clinton,"A thick, sweet and meaty dessert wine made from older vines, this offers a richness of Dr Pepper, baked plum and dried cherry."
France,86.0,15.0,CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne,Alain Jaume et Fils,"The 2014 vintage produced some atypically fresh and crisp whites in the RhÃ´ne. This example is round in the mouth yet still crisp on the finish, with fig and melon flavors accented by hints of crushed stone."
Italy,87.0,20.0,Lugana,Montonale,Delicate aromas of orchard fruit and citrus lead to a medium-bodied palate showing ripe yellow peach and green apple. A blast of candied tangerine closes the finish.
US,88.0,23.0,Mendocino County,Saracina,"A full and creamy style of Sauvignon Blanc, this has a lot of dense almond and vanilla notes set against high tones of bright peach and flint. With its great, fresh acidity, it will hold up against an appetizer like goat cheese on crackers."
Italy,88.0,25.0,Alto Adige,Caldaro,Aromas recall woodland berry and rose petal. The vibrant palate offers juicy raspberry and almond alongside crisp acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy soon.
Italy,93.0,60.0,Barbaresco,Albino Rocca,"This is a lovely vineyard designate Barbaresco that combines fresh flavors of cassis and wild berries with ethereal notes of root beer, licorice and tar. It finishes with smooth, sturdy tannins and will only improve over the next 5??0 years."
US,95.0,75.0,Sonoma Coast,Joseph Phelps,"Credit the cool vintage for this Pinot's mouthwatering acidity. The wine is rich but pristine with fruit, a testament to Phelps' superb viticultural practices and attention to detail at the sorting table. It's dry and crisp, yet rich and delicious, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, rosehip tea and cedar. The tannins give the wine a velvety grip. As good as it is now, it would be a shame not to cellar it. Your window of drinkability begins in 2019 and extends for 15 years after."
US,86.0,12.0,Central Coast,Red Truck,"Lush, round and flavorful, this Cab pleases for its array of fruit. Made in a soft, gentle style, its blackberry, currant, cherry and cocoa flavors finish in a swirl of sweet anise and pepper."
US,93.0,28.0,Willamette Valley,Trisaetum,"Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!"
Argentina,87.0,15.0,Mendoza,La Posta,"?Cocina??means ?the kitchen??in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now."
Italy,93.0,60.0,Brunello di Montalcino,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona,"Earthy and structured, this opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, grilled porcini, sunbaked earth, wild berry and dried aromatic herb. The big, bold palate doles out layers of mature black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, sage, tobacco and black tea. Firm, velvety tannins provide structure and finesse. Drink 2019??029."
US,96.0,50.0,Santa Maria Valley,Clendenen Family,"This bottling showcases Jim Clendenen's brilliance at making light wines packed with flavor. Rustic sagebrush, oak forest and animal pelt aromas meet red plum and alpine strawberry fruit on the nose. There's a salt and white pepper quality to the palate, where wild sage and more chapparal spice decorates the pomegranate and red plum fruit flavors."
US,87.0,30.0,Santa Barbara County,Rancho Sisquoc,"A nice, Beaune-style Pinot, rich in cherry and spice fruit, with good oak and medium-bodied. It's balanced in acids and tannins, with a smooth mouth feel, a good food wine."
US,88.0,20.0,Arroyo Seco,Mercy,"Fresh and minerally on the nose, this bottling shows the expected aromas of orange blossom, Key-lime pith, crushed soda and a touch of petrol. It's very light on the palate, disclosing lime zest, light nectarine juice and lemon-sorbet flavors."
US,86.0,22.0,Lodi,Bray,"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices."
US,89.0,60.0,Napa Valley,Darms Lane,"Dark, inky and smoky on the nose, this estate-grown Cab is supple and medium bodied, offering bursts of juicy dark plum and berry on the palate. The oak is well-integrated and unobtrusive."
Argentina,87.0,13.0,Mendoza,FranÃ§ois Lurton,"With its light color, minerally nectarine aromas and Provence leanings, this is a good facsimile of Old World rosÃ© with peach and raspberry flavors, a smooth finish and integrated acidic cut."
US,88.0,20.0,Sonoma County,Wellington,"This is a lushly concentrated, likable wine, soft in tannin and subtle in oak, with strong layers of black plum, berry and espresso."
US,85.0,16.0,Central Coast,La Merika,"The wine has a light, silky texture, low alcohol and the brisk acidity of the Central Coast. With savory raspberry and vanilla flavors, it's ready to drink now."
France,86.0,16.0,Beaujolais,Domaine du Vissoux,"Attractive and finely balanced, this has red cherry and strawberry flavors, which come wrapped in soft tannins and crisp acidity."
Italy,91.0,60.0,Barolo,Prunotto,"With fruit sourced from various vineyard sites, this dark and fleshy Barolo offers ripe fruit aromas with tar, licorice, smoked ham, toasted hazelnut and moist pipe tobacco. Prunotto offers a well-made wine on the extraripe and dense side that ends with an opulent, fruit-driven close."
US,92.0,60.0,Eola-Amity Hills,BergstrÃ¶m,"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade."
Spain,88.0,19.0,Cava,Princesa,"This is light, mildly yeasty, slightly pickled and briny smelling. It feels fresh and edgy, with good acidic cut, while the flavors lean toward orange and white peach. It holds onto its briny character on the finish, which is dry, bracing and tastes of mineral and lime."
Italy,86.0,28.0,Rosso di Montalcino,MÃ¡tÃ©,"This robust, one-dimensional wine delivers mature fruit sensations of stewed prune, fig and resin, along with oak extract, vanilla and espresso. The palate is sugary sweet but lacks fruit richness. Drying wood tannins leave an astringent finish."
